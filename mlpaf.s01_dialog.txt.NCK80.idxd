me for what i've done you're my son i love you nothing could ever change that please leave my son and his friends alone i didn't expect them to hate me so much what else did you expect from them my son you haven't earned their trust and erebus possesses their spirit and courage not for long he doesn't it seems we're about to receive some company eh zeb yes master knight shade has done well i suggest we roll out the red carpet and give them all a welcome they'll never forget capital idea capital ah my boy you've done well this is a fine assortment of shadows mmm very fine indeed surprise erebus as of right now i quit helping you steal shadows you can't mean that i made you what you are that's right you did but now i'm making my own decisions that's right not only is he quitting but we want everyone's shadow back and we want them back now i can't afford to let you turn on me knight shade you and your friends will pay dearly the master said you'd pay and now it's time for me to collect oh uh oh i'll take care of zeb find that satchel okay knight shade you fool you're out of your league here the satchel should be in one of these rooms we can't help running what'll we do the bushes quick hm ah hahahaha you can run my little friends but you can't hide split up and hide it's our only chance there's the satchel got it now let's go find the others ahh oh you girls oughta

away from him galaxy use your light no you won't zeb zeb quickly bring the satchel keep back mm i hunger zeb feed me my pleasure master let's get galaxy to safety so the shadow satchel seems to be the source of erebus power and the longer erebus chased after us and used up his energy the smaller he became that's right so if we can keep him exerting himself long enough we should be able to beat him but we'd need an army for that well that's kind of what i had in mind quickly i need more that one pony shadow wasn't enough i need more and i need it now but master there isn't any more and without knight shade there's no way to lure people to us i don't care zeb i need more shadows or i'll take yours yes yes now oh come on i need your help now remember i know i know it's important now remember

paradise find me for sure nine ten ready or not here i come hey no fair baby ribbon winked out baby ribbon you know winking out is against the rules now wink back in this minute i didn't mean to it's okay wink all the way back in so we can get on with the game i'll try she has such trouble winking back in come on baby ribbon want you to play some more come on little one you can do it i did it okay let's start over i'll be it again one two i'll hide in the pool do you mind ready or not here i come someone is hiding behind that rock and i think it's baby ribbon oh not again she's no fun baby ribbon we're waiting boy this is pathetic oh come on she's just a baby looks like she's having more trouble than usual maybe she winked back somewhere else i'll see if i can find her back in a jiffy something has happened to them i just know it we better tell megan i wonder where they could have gone baby ribbon where are you for that matter where am i ah now let's not jump to conclusions we don't know for certain that they're in trouble i have a bad feeling about it i've got to find out what's happened to them galaxy wait oh no she's gone too now hold on after all it's only been a couple of seconds the unicorns wink in and out instantly megan if galaxy had found ribbon and baby ribbon they'd be back by now what's going on i think they'll be back all right listen to me spread the word no more winking out until we know what's going on is that clear perfectly good thinking megan come on let's tell the other unicorns while there's still time i'm the queen of the mountain i'll wink up there and show her ah baby gusty stop oh no shoo-bee-doo shoop-shoop-bee-doo shoo-bee-doo shoop-shoop-bee-doo what's wrong fizzy i wanna cross the water use the rocks i'm afraid i'll fall in i think i'll just wink across shoo-bee-doo shoop-shoop-bee-doo shoo-bee-doo shoop-shoop-bee-doo hi have you seen fizzy around she just winked out but she didn't wink back in again i'm afraid gusty's gone too she was so impatient to run back here for lunch so she winked out instead that means i'm the only unicorn left let's get the other ponies we've got to form search parties and try to find the unicorns it's getting dark we're gonna have to get back to paradise estate just let me look around this rock buttons come back those rocks look like they might give way she winked out i saw her so did i tambelon i heard ribbon say tambelon then i woke up tambelon hmm it sounds familiar something to do with the legend of a lost city i'm sure that ribbon was trying to reach me telepathically but from where we'll never see them again no no they'll come back but from where where have the unicorns gone according to the ancient legend tambelon is the realm of darkness a sort of in-between place it last appeared ### years ago and its ruler grogar tried to conquer ponyland so what happened how did he wind up back in the realm of darkness ah i don't remember but grogar swore he would return in ### years to try again that still doesn't explain what happened to the unicorns if tambelon changes slowly from the realm of darkness to ponyland maybe one part changed faster than the others and somehow caught the unicorns when they were winking in and out you mean they might be in tambelon little unicorns had best eat no telling when the next meal might come if it comes there's gotta to be some way to get out of here how we can't wink through walls and that door is locked isn't there anything we can do i've already done the only thing i just hope my dream message got through to megan the unicorns have been fed master excellent now bray we will reach ponyland very soon prepare the troggles for arrival yes master right away oh and bray don't dawdle mmm no no master no dawdling of course not master right away master we'll form search parties again today i've never seen a storm come up so fast before this isn't a storm it's tambelon in the name of grogar capture the little ponies run get the little ponies it's done master dream valley is yours exactly as i planned today dream valley tomorrow all of ponyland gusty that rock-thing's gonna be plum sorry he messed with our gusty she is beyond help logic clearly dictates that we save ourselves gosh wind whistler how could you just go off and leave poor gusty what else would you expect from somebody with no feelings buttons no truly wind whistler's right we've gotta go on without gusty well whatever we're gonna do let's snap it up bye-bye gusty we'll be back she knows truly she knows woah track em y'know gusty was on the right track after all this one's for you gusty buttons don't betcha can't catch me oh yeah another one huh where'd she go yoo-hoo over here hey there she is she's drawing them off to the mountains then quickly no this way oh i hope buttons is okay oh i'm sure she's fine buttons y'all did it it doesn't take much to outsmart a rock okay now all we have to do is find this eminence guy the moochick said if we go to the purple mountains we couldn't miss him greetings uh excuse me whoever you are but do you know where we can find his elevated eminence you're standing on him remarkable this entire mountain is a living sentient being greetings your elevated eminence uh yes greetings your eminence we've come to ask for your help you see crunch the ro oh crunch he is definitely out of control and it's all my fault you see i needed a guard to protect the heartstone which is the magical gem that gives me feelings i created crunch the rockdog to protect the gem but i neglected to put any heart into crunch himself accidentally creating a cold ferocious beast but i discovered my mistake too late to make him indestructible i had put a piece of black lava rock from the roiling depths of the volcano of gloom into his collar it gives crunch the power to turn anything to stone there's only one thing powerful enough to defeat him the heartstone you must take it and stop crunch well i guess that doesn't sound so difficult where is the heartstone anyway deep within me and how do we uh get there i'll guide you but i'm not exactly certain what will happen when the heartstone is removed w-what could possibly happen which way to the left one more jaunt to the right and you're there it's beautiful take it megan ooh maybe i shouldn't go ahead my dear which way your eminence uh-oh careful megan give me my heartstone what's the matter with him if his eminence gets his feelings from the heartstone then without it he's turning into a major-league grouch run hurry this way hurry this way come on let's go no that way look i've found you who wants to be turned to stone first you've gone too far this time rockdog no truly no truly don't go stay here go ahead huh go ahead what are you talking about what's the matter with you you really don't like anyone do you i mean it go ahead i don't care what you do with her you're crazy if you think i'll buy that i'm perfectly serious i've been surrounded by these romantic idiots for so long it is refreshing to find one such as yourself wind whistler how could you pay no attention to them crunch you really don't care what i do to her that sentimental fool certainly not good cause i'm gonna turn her to stone haha i thought so you do care don't you wait i'll prove i'm on your side by giving you your next victim yeah that's it wind whistler bring me to him the heartstone please heartstone do something no it worked she's alright hey you guys look it's me hooray it's gusty i knew you wouldn't turn against us wind whistler yeah yeah we're okay we're okay yeah yeah fine i feel good hooray we found you stop laughing stop cheering why are you so happy there's nothing to be happy about stop it or i'll bite ya i bet all he needs is a little heart yeah then he'd be a nice puppy now hold still look i can't believe how happy he looks well of course he does well i guess we'd better get this back to his eminence before he turns into a permanent grump thank you for all your help i'm pleased that crunch now has a heart of his very own goodbye goodbye eminence bye bye wind whistler uh we're sorry we said you had no feelings and we uh we wanna thank you for doing what you did back there why logic alone dictated my actions it would have been too much trouble to carry three heavy stone statues all the way home just kidding help help she's done for no it's no use hang on baby shady it's all right now baby shady you're fine masquerade saved you everything's gonna be okay nothing's gonna be okay until that walking bad luck charm is gone i'm sorry woebegone but you know that's true that's okay lickety-split no one has ever been this kind to me for so long as you but i've got to leave before you start hating me that would never happen it's just no use ahh ahhh no i'm sorry all these terrible things are happening to him but i just don't see why we should all suffer it doesn't have to be this way golly it looks like there was a fire woebegone where are you woebegone please come down before you hurt yourself what's the use i'm bound to get hurt no matter where i am i just don't want you to so please go away see no i really don't why is this happening to you the last time i tried to tell you paradise estate collapsed i hate to think what might happen this time oh finish the story please now let's see where did i leave off oh yeah i remember now there i was face to face with the old witch floating in a pond of her potion which i knocked us into my friends were in no position to help help even if they wanted to it was an accident it was just bad luck things like this are always happening to me if it would help any to say i'm really sorry whoa sorry you haven't begun to be sorry you say bad luck follows you would you to be the clumsy that you seem to think you are the world would be a fearful place for all folks near and far so arm yourself with charms of luck that may will serve you well for you crumbled your own cookie and your future is in this spell but when you have a change of mind and believe your deeds both good and true your small black cloud will shrivel up and the sun will shine on you that'll teach him a lesson a curse she put a curse on me ooh you should have seen him he just shoved that ol witch right in her own potion wham oh i didn't really it was just an accident come come my boy you're a hero nah i just really absolutely what's going on what are you doing ah look what you've done you hooligan but i didn't sure just like you didn't push that old witch in the soup you don't go messing around with witches without paying the price now be off with ya ya little jinx i guess i really am a jinx there maybe that'll stop any bad luck that might be hanging over me there he is there's the little jinx woebegone this is your fault i'd better leave before the whole town floats away until now all anyone's wanted to see of me is my back as i leave town we'll always be your friends woebegone we don't believe in curses really but maybe you feel just a teensy bit guilty about what happened to that old witch maybe you've brought all that bad luck down on yourself how well you believe it'll happen and so it does if ya stop believing it it'll stop happening maybe that's what the witch meant your own bad attitude brought your misfortune it even created that little black cloud and when anyone felt sorry for you and tried to help you believed it would be bad for them and so it was the witch just brought all your fears to life maybe if you believe in yourself only good things will happen to you i am good i am you must believe in yourself i am not bad luck i defy you to strike me i did it you sure did you overcame your own worst enemy yourself what do you want i wish to congratulate my friend woebegone and you as well you have broken my spell which means you have learnt a great lesson about yourself all that you touch shall be plagued no more the evil be gone the good will endure look at your leg the bandage is gone she fixed my leg she fixed my leg oh thank you yippee yahoo oh thank you thank you thank you all right let's go let's go posies garden's fixed yippee lickety-split lickety-split why did you bring him back for i just had the nursery repaired he's not gonna hurt the nursery he's not bad luck anymore look no more little black cloud and i'm not hiding it under my hat either i'm cured of my bad attitude so now nothing bad will happen well i'm going home now if the witch's spell is broken that means my village has been restored have a safe journey i will thanks to you it's okay it could happen to anyone so he's a little clumsy well nobody's perfect i just can't imagine a better day for playing polo can you i've never been very good at polo polo is not difficult keeping the ball in play is a simple matter of potential energy meeting mass and being converted into kinetic energy huh what wind whistler means shady is just whap it with your nose here it comes oh oh oh uh no i'm just not cut out for this stuff come on shady it's not that hard you just have to keep your eye on the ball i've got it i object the rules explicitly state that the ball may not be engaged by unicorn magic don't panic i'll get it down as soon as i figure out how perhaps i can be of assistance i've never had one get away from me before uh-oh hey uh where are we anybody see our ball i can't even see my feet what is this place it is called the mystificent forest and there are those who still hold to the hypothesis that a strange enclave flourishes beyond huh i'm simply saying there may be other beings who live in this forest w-w-what do you mean beings gnome-like creatures called dell dwellers who actually live below the forest floor they are the caretakers of the forest they do magnificent work making rough lumps of rock into the smooth stones danny likes to skip on the lake and where do you suppose these huge oak trees come from were it not for the dell dwellers the forest might not have any trees at all they are very orderly and well-balanced society and they do all this work without any glory or reward you don't think they're dangerous do you maybe we've gone as far as we should i want to go back whoa whoa wait up don't leave me here alone whoa this is great whoops ouch ow ow ow what have we done frazzits run hide don't let them get us ouch oh my what have we done wind whistler quickly we must do something this is no time for frivolity these multicolored protoplasmic organisms are ruining the ecology of this place did i say that wind whistler what is wrong with you look fizzy no hooves shady come down from there okey dokey whoa shady this isn't like you and wind whistler is acting so silly those frazzits are mixing up everyone we must do something sorry fizz you're on your own i want to check this place out looks like i shall have to take charge here these frazzits must go back into the barrel uh-ho i appear to be making matters worse my bubbles work but this will take forever and i do not believe my friends and these creatures can afford to wait that long speaking of friends where is gusty there you are what are you doing in there gusty hiding this is not like you gusty come out of there now i need your help now can you make a breeze and blow these things back into the barrel please gusty i'll try no not that way you're dispersing them gently gusty please come on just a little harder shady we need you to knock the frazzits into the barrel no sweat fizz almost done well that is the last of them nothing happened everyone's still the same this side down hmm gusty shady come here i need your help help me turn this barrel over this is what is causing all the problems careful this side up i certainly hope this is correct we can't thank you enough you saved our dell and the entire forest aw it was nothing much that's easy for you to say gusty but what really did happen well when we fell into the dell we uh we kind of knocked over this barrel as long as the frazzits remain in the barrel the balance of nature is preserved but we inadvertently released them and upset the balance that's exactly right but fizzy took control and restored everything to normal i did i mean how did i do that balance what balance what are you talking about as i said everything is back to normal steady steady that's it dear me i'm not half so good as you robin hood you'll get the hang of it north star watch ah impossible i've never missed a shot ever there clean as a whistle just let me clean what's underneath and what's happening to my strength oh my dear all my life my heart has yearned for one as fair as you and you and you and you my dearest my darling my only my one true love a wrinkle my face my perfect face it's ruined graceful flowing my little salomes run my little ones the monster and what about the barometric pressure the pollen count and oh i just wished for a perfect day don't be discouraged lickety-split give it another try at this point the only thing that would cheer me up is a nice big ice-cream cone and i mean a huge one chocolate strawberry vanilla butter pecan here we go again pardon me but i believe i can expedite matters lickety-split would like a ###-foot sugar cone filled with ### scoops of rocky road each scoop # to # feet in diameter and the entire confection should be covered with # tons of chocolate jimmies you got it gee wiz you did it indeed it's exactly what i requested of course you expected something less uh-oh make it go away but you just called it perfection make it disappear huh run run run w-what happened how'd ya make it disappear i didn't that ice-cream cone should have lasted long enough for you to eat it yoo-hoo prince charming darling it's me your little heart throb my they certainly are letting this place get rundown appalling oh princey-poo huh what happened to the words where are the pictures the storybooks are all blank megan are you there paradise what're you doing here i wanted to ask you about some new legends i've just met robin hood chaharazad paul bunyan you met them

that place is simply falling apart falling apart the land of legends let's help them if we can the land beyond the door is falling apart i think it's because they left the land of legends i bet if you

into bumbleland wait what if it's a trap we can't argue about it now let's go sting prepare the honeycomb where did you go yes your bumbleness right away what are you doing i'm going i'll get the honeycomb ready okay i'll get it oh how does anything ever get done around here the sunstone i don't think it's a good idea why doesn't anybody listen to me let's get it wait help we're trapped we can't get out you're mine now my little flutter ponies and i've got some marvelous plans for you but first sting place the sunstone to reflect the sun bring forth those golden rays that will make bumbleland drip with rich nectar-bearing flowers by sunset flutter valley will be just the way we like it wilted aww are we getting close to furbobia no yes i think we'd better rest for a while me too heavy don't you worry about a thing baby cuddles everything's going to be fine cupcake is right that leg of yours will be fixed up in no time right furbobs definitely maybe ahh gee i wish we could have some apples yeah an apple me too i want one gosh wishful that was terrific you mean all you have to do is make a wish and you get what you wish for gosh well it doesn't work all the time no not all the time sometimes once in a while rarely i think we'd better be moving on to furbobia the sun is going to set soon ready little ponies ready let's do it lift to furbobia ouch huh i think it's that way on second thought maybe it's that way i wonder if they speak our language i don't think so what are we going to do yeah what yeah what maybe i could snort to them i heard my dad do it once a long time ago what did you say spike i i don't know oh goodie goodie i can't wait more i want more don't you think you ought to wait a few minutes i've been waiting a lifetime for this sting get me some more ah yes your bumbleness whatever you say do you still want to turn the other wing morning glory there must be a simple explanation for this seemingly mean act there is bumble got the sunstone the witches got flutter valley and we got honeysuckle morning glory what's done is done what we have to do now is get out of here we have one chance flutter ponies if we try very hard maybe we can blow down these walls and escape we can do it rosedust we're with you we'll try anything let's do it all right flutter ponies shift to utter flutter release the honey there is no escape now flutter ponies you will be my slaves yes slaves grogar's got to have some weakness if only we can find it i did notice that whenever grogar used his magic the bell around his neck became luminescent interesting perhaps the bell is the repository of his power repository oh yeah right what did she say she thinks the bell might be the source of his magic get the bell and we win it's worth a try but how do we do it i know we'll use your pocket tape recorder if we can get bray's voice on tape we can use it to lure grogar outside the city wall and grab his bell there's just one problem i left my backpack at paradise estate when the troggles took over no problem we'll just get it back oh yeah how simple we'll take em by surprise now listen surprise hi guys hey come on hey stop that pony yee-ha ho the window it still works what happens now now eh now comes the hard part they almost saw us flying in here we've got to be careful i spotted bray when we were airborne i think he is around here there he is so you call yourselves guards this is your last chance grogar didn't capture all those ponies just so you can let them escape time to go stop them okay i've spliced the tape together let's see how it sounds grogar,this is your last chance to capture all those ponies it just might work if masquerade can fool grogar speaking of masquerade where is she wow her disguise is great grogar bray i thought you were at the dungeon this is your last chance to capture all those ponies okay masquerade run wait give up grogar we've got you surrounded you're wrong boy i have got you surrounded uh-oh

so cold that soon the whole world will be frozen over all who are unworthy of living in such a lovely climate will be frozen and i shall rule the whole world as will you edgar when you become king no father what i don't wanna rule the world and even if i did it wouldn't be right when you are king you may decide what is and is not right but i am king now and what i say is law is that clear but why should only penguins survive yeah what's wrong with bein a duck they're weak how can they withstand the cold why should w-w-we have to sonny he is but a bad influence on you you won't be listening to his nonsense anymore guards how could you when you are king you'll understand these things is that the best ya all can do north star honey all right baby give it a good swat stop this all of you

the way here but it's more serious here than i thought i don't know what we should do i know we'll go north that's where it's always coldest oh yeah right just what we need to get colder good thinking don't you see north is where we'll probably find the source of this cold wave she's right the cold has to come from somewhere and it normally comes from north come this way is north tally-ho okay so we went north now anybody got a clue as to what we're looking for we just have to be patient keep at it surprise but i'm so cold galaxy get a load of this it's surf rider and sea shimmer yes and i

under surprise and i shall fly overhead and guide the rest of you through these maze agreed so sorry megan i suppose it's just a bit too cold nice try you two but i think we'll have to rely on galaxy's intuition come on another dead end i am sorry megan i feel so lost welcome to the club we'll never get outta here i don't believe this megan galaxy giving up well not me this way hoo-hoo-hoo i suppose we've really nothing to lose by following her what oh my stars look an abominable snowman this is a surprise i don't like it will all be over soon what the this is incredible we coulda told

did but they work for porcina how can she turn ponyland into glass she's a magic princess there's no way we could stop her no we'll find a way to stop her i've gotta think of a way to stop the princess her magic is all in her cloak and i must say it looks much better since they used all our hair to re-weave it oh the cloak is beautiful oh and i'm beautiful too don't you agree a sight for sore eyes yeah very sore don't you wanna test out the power of your new cloak of course but what should i test it on ponyland ooh uh-uh yes that could do with some improving kazeem kazaam kazoom

that home of yours all our things why are they so frightened work you wretches harder it was my magic which gave you life you are mine now i beezen i'm now master of paradise estate that's him the one who gave us the paint oh well that explains it beezen is a powerful sorcerer his power is in his wand oh he must have known of your need for paint before you even met him hmm this has all been part of a carefully conceived plan to steal your home our things may have turned against us but paradise estate is still our home then let's go get it back oh for cryin out loud i was just mopped an hour ago beezen ordered me to mop you again oh this sure ain't like the old days oh how i miss the ponies they were so nice so tidy ah get back to work ponies keep the ponies out hold it beezen's probably got

no for centuries i've been your slave beezen but now you're mine all mine now you'll learn some manners no please no no power is needed day and night working me into exhaustion we'll see how you like it you'll like it this place is in worse shape than before that's fine with me there's nothing better than a sense of accomplishment to make you feel all good inside what paradise i never thought i'd hear you say that it's certainly is nice to have everything back to normal normal everything i miss baby buggy awww help ghost is here go away ghost but you called me to come back well we we just

the house i i got you all out every one of us oh good hey what is this it's a trap help get us out let us go please this is probably a practical joke right i don't think so gingerbread actually i was well you see i i was forced to come here by squirk oh who is squirk the meanest thing i can think of and he has been for about ten thou oh er twenty hundred no it was well a long long time anyway which is when all this started long long before you ponies lived here when all this land every place around here was underwater and ruled by that slimy no-good squirk squirk was a tyrant all right an evil and nasty dictator oh he was simply awful he didn't allow anyone to say a word against him if they did he used the power of his magical amulet the flashstone to punish them and he used it oh mercilessly oh he was just plain cruel over the years the water mysteriously sank back into the earth nobody knows why or how or that is well er it just started to go and soon other creatures came to live here including my kin the pennas ruff my grandfather was their leader the pennas didn't come to to fight they simply wanted a place to live but squirk he didn't want the pennas living in the vicinity no i should say not he wanted all the land to himself and so using his powerful flashstone squirk tried to chase the pennas away but my grandfather brave and tough as he was refused to be bullied er huh hey what whoah and with great courage he took the flashstone away from squirk he threw one half into the deepest part of the river and the other half into what came to be known as dream valley a place ruff knew squirk could never go squirk hid underwater for years waiting for my grandfather to get old weaker squirk didn't care he'll live for centuries where's your grandfather now squirk has kidnapped him he's holding grandfather ruff hostage to force me to cooperate with him what does all this have to do with us or paradise estate uhh well you'll see i'm so sorry little ponies

dreary no one's ever been here before we are sure to find something terribly exciting like that it says keep out well they couldn't mean us paradise where could it lead i wonder wait what if there's something dangerous behind that door think north star before you do anything rash very well very well oh drat let's have a go at it shall we north star please this could be the golden door a long long time ago the most fearsome creature ever known terrorized ponyland so a sorcerer forged the golden door a gateway to the land of legends a mysterious door of realm and it was through that golden door that the beast was pushed into the land of legends as long as no one passes through the door the beast will remain there so reign in that curiosity of yours north star and stay away from that door now if you'll excuse me i've had enough exploring for one day a brightfully silly story i fancy she simply made it up north star how could anything dangerous be behind such a lovely door in any event paradise didn't say not to open it she merely said not to pass through it north star don't oh how dreary well that certainly was a disappointment ohh stand and deliver oh no hold steeds what manner of pony are these aye who'd be your master does he have any money we we have no master or money no money allow me to introduce myself i am hood robin hood and these are my eh huh merry men merry men we

out of the estate by uninvited guests shame on you come come lofty tisn't that bad no what about the legend if anyone passes through that door everyone came through the door already and we shut it behind us there was no monster monster we don't have to worry oh then why are they so nervous prince charming darling how romantic this isn't the way out shhhh be very quiet the best thing that bag of

followed megan and the others here in hopes that we could help rescue you i mean i could help rescue you i mean after all it was probably my fault in the first place that you were captured i should have stayed with you gotten help or something oh no it wasn't your fault you couldn't have saved us from the raptorians anyway i think i just might be able to help after all did you ever notice how much hair the bushwoolies shed yeah yeah shed yeah yeah shed and how much it looks like pony hair once it's cut yeah yeah pony hair yeah pony hair if we use the bushwoolie hair to weave a fake magic cloak and exchange it for the real one maybe we can use the real one to change the spell yeah yeah hair yeah cloak to the weaving room to the weaving room hurray shhhh okay let's do it my beautiful cloak my beauty beauty shhhhh ah ah ah ah thanks hmm my lovely lovely cloak what are they doing shhhhh what do we do now gusty you stand on that side of the bed shady on this side molly hold the torch up and i'll stand at the foot as soon as she moves grab it oh oh all these wonderful mirrors oh i must be even more magnificent than i thought sorry i think i'm allergic to pigs oh dear which one is the real cloak somebody is coming hide hide yeah hide raptorians are coming yeah coming i hope this is it porcina porcina porcina the ponies have escaped oh what is it shrock it's the ponies ah ah ah they've escaped escaped you got to help us find them and and turn them into glass before they ruin everything you're giving me orders now ponies get'em stop before i turn you into toads oh she's bluffing that's an obvious fake porcina turn em all into glass before they ruin everything kazeem kazaam oh oh ah i-i can't i can't the ponies in my crystal orb didn't seem real but these ponies here these living breathing trembling creatures of flesh are alive just like you and me i don't have the right to turn them into glass what are you crazy they'll ruin everything then give it to me all right you little pests first i'm gonna turn you all into glass and then i'm gonna shatter you one by one kazeem kazaam kazoom this cloak's a dud that must be the real one get it boys don't be afraid huh don't worry they never felt it in fact they never felt anything not about you or me not about anything but themselves i guess i didn't see that i didn't see a lot of things till now well there's still time to put things right let's get back to ponyland and help our friends okay in fact i'll lead the way beem salaah sim wait kazoom kazaam kazeem you see shady your bravery quick thinking came through when we needed them most so don't you ever underestimate yourself again now well that cloak was probably never a good thing for me to have had anyway but what's to become of me now bushwoolies think porcina not so bad oh why not stay with bushwoolies underground we need clever and beautiful hair groomer yeah yeah yeah yeah beautiful groomer oh why not bye bye bye bye isn't this a great spot for picnic it's okay yeah i guess hey look out shoo go away whoa you're lucky you didn't fall in the water danny shoo-bee-doo shoop-shoop-bee-doo shoo-bee-doo shoop-shoop-bee-doo oh so what's wrong with water water is fun watch wee wow terrific a treasure chest they're very pretty i wonder where they came from virtually anywhere i would say there are a myriad springs and rapids in ponyland strong enough to carry it along i sense that there's more to them than there appears to be ah who cares we're here to have fun come on let's play volleyball hey wait a minute where're we gonna get a ball to play with no problem watch this here it comes i got it hey no fair flying good one i wanna eat soon hungry hush now baby lickety-split it won't be long now sweet stuff are you okay i'm sorry i'll pick all the coins up go ahead and finish your game first i got it i i got it i got it i oh oops you got it all right gusty no sweat i'll just make another bubble i only wish i can make bubbles that are big and strong enough to keep our popcorn huh wow look at that gee pretty can you do it again fizzy this is me don't break it molly you're too high megan help me i'm scared get me down she's in trouble we gotta do something salt salt has a corrosive effect if you sprinkle it on the bubble's surface good idea wind whistler let's go push it that way wind whistler over the pond ahh shoo-bee-doo shoop-shoop-bee-doo shoo-bee-doo shoop-shoop-bee-doo i glad molly is safe but i feel hungry i wish there was food stacked as high as a tree this is impossible i believe the coins are responsible megan i saw baby lickety-split standing on one as she made her wish and the coin glowed and dematerialized magic coins magic coins i think baby half note might be right the symbol engraved on each coin tells what kind of wish the coin grants looks like it's gonna rain picnic's over you guys let's get back to the estate i wish it never rained again never again hurray now we can have our picnic after all i've never seen a storm clear up that fast before i know it doesn't seem quite normal somehow posey what's wrong nothing but disaster come and see this is terrible posey this meteorological debacle is quite anomalous i mean it has not rained for weeks something unusual is happening i guess i never really realized how nice rain is not gonna rain again ever i made wish so that's why it hasn't rained come on heartthrob did use any of those coins well yes but only one and it was for such a good cause our sweet stuffs makeup was positively ruined by the heat and there was this coin with a mask on it sweet stuff where are you over here why are you hiding sweet stuff if you looked like this wouldn't you megan it is obvious that the metaphysical power of these coins can have unforeseen and hazardous side effects not only that but wishing on them can get us into a lot of trouble we better find those coins and fast magic star have you seen the rest of the coins sure megan i put em in my good luck collection for safekeeping great go get em maybe we can get ourselves out of this mess there are only three left i don't know what any of these symbols mean try wishing for rain on them we wish it would rain we wish it would rain nothing now what are we gonna do ponyland's gonna dry up and blow away we'll have to go ask the moochick he's our only hope shoo-bee-doo shoop-shoop-bee-doo shoo-bee-doo shoop-shoop-bee-doo look the baby seaponies they've run out of water wha-what's that come on let's find out well how about that aren't they the strangest looking

soil and water can't go another step without water look we're saved rich soil oh yeah we're saved oh oh boy oh boy just hold it no there's some kind of creature in there it it seems nice whatever it

to capture us but we escaped and they've come after us to hunt us down and enslave us we've suffered so at their hands you mean at their claws claws so it's you those creatures were after you've seen

phew that's the last of em now what we do with them lock them up in a cage of stone till we're strong then we'll take care of them but ma'am you've got to believe us we were after them because we're police and they are escaped convicts that's right ma'am ma'am they ruin the soil there'll be nothing left but brown dirt i can't believe you the flories haven't done any damage but you you went and trampled my garden i don't know i'm getting a bad feeling about this i think i'd better keep an eye on those flories are are they gone would you relax what a sweetheart setup thanks to those four-legged suckers the long claws of the law are trapped where they can't give us anymore grief all this land is ours yeah this garden is only an appetizer so what are we waiting for come on dig in yeah hey whose hogging all the magnesium leave some for me say get your elbow out of my face spread out well well well looks like one of those multi-colored dingbags is smarter than we thought i guess this'll teach ya who to root for huh this will teach you not to steal my treasure we didn't steal it we spent it niblick listen let us go and i promise we'll bring you back a treasure of equal value to the one we spent interesting proposition she's right mr niblick equal value i promise humph did she say equal value we'll get you something better hmm on one condition though huh megan dear have you slipped your bridle we are hardly in a position to make demands if we bring you another treasure do you promise to undo the wishes of the magic coins sounds fair not that i care anything about being fair okay you got it come on in okay here's the deal you bring me somethin better than my magic coins which ain't gonna be easy and i undo the spell can't you undo the spell before we find you another treasure ponyland needs rain before it turns into a desert i live in a desert look you're wasting my time come back with somethin i like and we'll talk what do you think niblick would like puck i know i think that old troll would like to have the heart of fire what's that it's a huge ruby in the crater of fire mountain or he might go for the beautiful golden rose in the haunted garden then there's always the emerald idle in the ruins of the city of the ancients well i guess we better split up and try for all three that way we're sure to get at least one try to get a few drops on them it might keep them going we're gonna have to go back to paradise estate there's no other choice but what if there's no water there either there will be molly there has to be this place is full of bad luck i just know it ah you're imagining things magic star it's just an old garden spike i think these hedge animals are alive of course they're alive heart throb they're plants look there it is wait a minute spike what if these things are guarding the rose ah you've been listening to too many of paradise's stories then again maybe you got something there darlings may i make a suggestion run run where do i have to think of everything wait a minute i said these monsters are just plants right well plants hate fire let's go quick thinking niblick's gonna love it i hate it oh duh i mean niblick surely you jest i mean it's definitely new it smells real nice here try it you dimwitted dragon i can't a a ah-choo as i was saying i got rose fever for this breath i sure hope the others have better luck than we did the emerald idol's in there but be careful it's guarded by a series of traps why does that not surprise me oh come on how bad can it be i'm taking no chances i'll just wink over there and grab it oh galaxy don't worry we'll get you out of there careful careful the floor is booby trapped be careful gingerbread oh don't worry i'm okay i'll have you out of there in a jiffy galaxy and i'll get the idol hurray i got it yahoo no puck uh-oh puck get the idol outside i'll free galaxy right i sure wish i could wink through this thing hurry wink out of here wow talk about a tight squeeze we did it we got the emerald idle let's take it back to niblick you cracked it mini-mind nice try but you gotta do better than that once we get to the top how do we get the heart of fire i suggest we traverse that overpass when we encounter it ah she means we should cross that bridge when we come to it oh right we just came to it and there isn't any bridge how're we ever gonna get it can you fly over to it wind whistler in theory yes in practicality the thermal updrafts from the lava may make it difficult still we shall see wind whistler no use i fear the air currents destroy my equilibrium now what do we do it's too far for me to wink to hmm fizzy you can't reach it but maybe one of your bubbles can yeah they're still real big and strong because of the wish i made if you send it close enough perhaps we can retrieve the gem megan the bubble is so big it's hard to control you concentrate on flying wind whistler i'll grab the gem ah ohh ah oh megan wind whistler i'm so sorry that's all right fizzy we got the ruby now we'll just fly back in not yet the turbulence is still too great oh ah what's pluma doing i found it but you destroyed paradise estate i had to destroy the estate to get to the amulet if i don't give this to squirk i'll never see my grandfather again ever oh yeah well what about us please try to understand perhaps i can restore it with this now let's see i mean it's a matter of thinking about what you uh that is to say you mean the flashstone will do whatever he or she wills oh exactly then do it oh sounds like it's working huh well that sure looks weird i'm sorry but it's the best i can do without the other half of the amulet our home no good still can't live there shh baby heart throb we'll get it fixed somehow do you know where the other half of the amulet is no but with this half the other half can be found uh i think that's what grandfather said then let's look for it together no no no we don't have time i have to get this to squirk right away there must be something we can do buttons fizzy come on i've got an idea so how's your ancient feathered friend oh so help me squirk if i ever get out of here by cracky i i oh oh

go but we didn't do anything didn't do anything you've done plenty or rather your friend knight shade did we don't know what's wrong but we're not gonna let you do that to the rest of em but knight shade is not our friend so you say say i've got it mr mayor look at the sick children they cast no shadows that's the reason they're sick knight shade must have stolen their shadows that makes sense no doubt they feel empty and incomplete the loss of their shadows being an outward sign of some loss of substance please mr mayor you must let us go what happened to your children could be happening to the baby ponies right now we must be free to stop this knight shade well perhaps i will let you go but sheriff ricotta and i will go with you you'll need our help to get past our nasty cousins the roadies nobody comin to save us where grown-ups can't give up hey let's sing i wonder where the baby ponies could be our babies the coast is clear we're so glad we've found you but you're so pale we're sick knight shade stole shadows well he's not gonna get away with it we're going to make him give those shadows back there he is let's go after him where he's on his way to his trailer let's go get him what is that in the mirror it looks as if that looking-glass could use a good cleaning to me you fiend you'd better give our babies back their shadows or else we're gonna make you pay for what you did to our children yep yeah yeah yeah we've gotta catch knight shade or we'll never get our babies shadows look at that uh oh uh i didn't wanna do it i didn't wanna do it then why did you he made me do it who erebus he's a wizard he looks like a big gray storm cloud that must be the thing we saw in the mirror yes that's how he gives me my orders what kind of orders to steal shadows for him although zeb is the one who actually steals em he puts them in his satchel you mean the babies shadows were in the satchel he was carrying yeah that's right and we let him get away was he taking them to erebus yeah so you see i couldn't give back your babies shadows i haven't got em what does erebus do with the shadows i don't know exactly but they give him power power which he uses to make me do what he wants you see i come from grayvale a place that used to be called bright valley i tried my best as a singer there but nobody came to see me i was ready to give up then erebus came along he said he was a wizard and promised to make me a star all he said he wanted in return was a little cooperation the first concert he promoted in bright valley was a smash everyone in town was there and while i was singing erebus had zeb steal everyone's shadow including my own mother's when i saw what erebus had done i refused to work for him anymore and i demanded that he give everyone their shadows back but he threatened to steal my shadow and he laughed at me i didn't know then that the shadows provided erebus with energy that gave him his magical powers and he used the energy from the shadows to make himself into this huge cloud of energy i don't know how he does that it's a closely guarded secret i'm not even sure zeb knows then erebus made me take my act on the road and he sent zeb along to do the shadow stealing and as i became famous more fans came to see me zeb stole more shadows and erebus became even more powerful his hunger for power is endless and i'm forced to help zeb supply him with more and more shadows if i don't help him he'll steal my shadow which would end my career but worse it would mean that i'd never have any hope of restoring grayvale and my mother to the way they used to be please let him go he didn't really wanna hurt us what do you think well the poor creature didn't have any choice did he thank you baby heart throb you know you're so lucky to have loved ones who care about you so much i have a wonderful mother but she she has to live with the terrible shame of what i've done to her and grayvale i think we oughta help knight shade you mean we should fight erebus ourselves exactly that's the only way we'll ever get the babies shadows back and our children's shadows too yup and my mother's and the rest of grayvale's well what are we waiting for guys knight shade show us the way to grayvale alright yeah where is everybody i think they must be in hiding knight shade knight shade knight shade you've got a lot of nerve coming back

interesting mr moochick but can you do anything to reverse the effects of the wish ooh no no no no absolutely not i'm afraid you see since the treasure belongs to niblick only he can reverse its magic hmm okay then we'll just go talk to this niblick and ask him to help us ooh i don't know trolls are usually crotchety and ill-mannered and niblick's even crankier than most we don't have any choice come on again we're off the crimson canyon thanks for your help mr moochick no you're quite welcome i am sure habbit had you seen the book i was reading i don't know where it got through oh no its dried up whistler you couldn't know the water would dry up this quickly is there somewhere else we can go we just have to find water for the seaponies it's even too hot to fly this weather is simply

we possibly save the rest of the flutter ponies and the sunstone too look a rainbow what good is a rainbow it's just pretty that's all megan lives on the other side i remember the little ponies telling us that who's megan she always helps the little ponies when they're in trouble maybe she'll help us let's go do you know how to get there no but it can't be that difficult we have to try this is where megan lives it looks like the place the little ponies told us about let's see if we can find her i've never seen a megan before what would she look like well she's kind of big and and has long hair only on her head and oh well you'll know her when you see her megan are you here megan not here what if she's gone on a trip or something oh she just has to be here we need her uh-oh is that megan run in there over the rainbow is not such a safe place to live either if only megan were here oh no megan well here's another fine mess we've gotten ourselves into it's my fault i trusted drog and he led us into a trap it was a risk worth taking danny don't worry we're not beaten yet but midnight is not far off megan and when it strikes we shall all be banished to the realm of darkness i can't help but feel that the big bell we found is important it has something to do with grogar's power i'm certain of it in you go traitor he called you a traitor that means you didn't betray us a few troggles are still loyal to grogar they told him of my plan to help you well that wasn't very nice but most of my people are fed up with grogar they would help you against him if you would give us a new home in ponyland you bet we would oh yes we would why not but how can we get word to the rest of the troggles we can't escape this dungeon good news master the moochick and the baby ponies have been captured that means ponyland is mine this calls for a celebration tell the troggles that anyone not found celebrating will be banished along with the ponies at midnight er rh right away master now start the spell that will banish the ponies from ponyland forever wonder what they're so happy about they're not they're just following grogar's orders that's funny it sounds louder over here and it gets louder the higher i go it's loudest at this crack and there's fresh air coming through if there were some way to widen the crack something we could force into it barf try this i'd rather pour it in a crack than eat it if we could put the gruel into the crack and make it bubble it would expand and make the crack bigger i've got it forget-me-not you and peach blossom carry the bucket up to the crack okay now buttons you move the soup from the bucket into the crack i'll try but everybody get out from underneath just in case hurry we can't hold it much longer look out below phew fizzy you've got to make that stuff in the crack bubble okay hey it's working look out i'd say good show forget-me-not come with us we'll find a way to get the door open hurry we've got to find bray and get those keys from him look there's bray not so fast bray what hey stop hey hey what are you doing get away from me i'll take those stop come back no grogar's gonna be mad when he hears about this hee-haw let's go everybody it's almost midnight escaped you fool it wasn't my fault if they get out of the city you will take their place the ponies are free now it's time to set ourselves free help us against grogar and you'll be free what do we do now we've got to reach the gates before midnight come on it's grogar boy if it isn't one thing it's another i say it looks like we're trapped somebody think of something i'm trying but nothing rings any bells ring the bell that's it excuse me what was that the bell we found in the hidden room legend says that when it's rung grogar's power will be destroyed it's our only chance north star can you find your way back to that bell in time a mere trifle megan then let's go it's time to ring in some changes it's fading away but where are megan and north star look here they come you did it megan what happened to grogar and bray they're gone back into the realm of darkness with tambelon well i hope you and the rest of the troggles enjoy living in ponyland drog i'm sure we will but i still can't believe grogar is really gone for good well it took him ### years to build the old bell even with the troggle's help so i don't think he'll be back anytime soon look you don't think it's grogar do you guess not        
