well we've gotten away from lavan and his demons now what do we do the moochick said we have to find the heart of ponyland the heart of ponyland i seem to recall an ancient legend about that i remember too a magical talisman far beneath lavan's kingdom what does it do according to the legend it's the source from which our magic wands draw their power maybe if we can bring the wands to it we can recharge them with magic well what are we waiting for let's get moving what is it master we can find no trace of the princess ponies and their friends incompetent fool ah if you want anything done right you have to do it yourself how are you princesses holding up oh well enough considering considering what considering how ugly these caverns are and that there are no plants or trees or flowers and that hm sorry i didn't mean to complain there it is the heart of ponyland now i remember according to the legend we have to lay our wands in the crowns and then their power will be restored well no time like the present oh no it's lavan get away from there oh with every new minute i learn how to control my powers more you have no chance oh what's going to happen lavan controls the high ground he can stay where he is and pick us off or he can come down and get us what else can he do he could give up ah but i don't think we should count on that i'm gonna make one last surveillance flight before we return to the others be careful wind whistler wind whistler oh i-i can't move it go get the others but there's not enough time by the time i get back with help ooh we're done for now lavan's going to destroy us all unless we fight back how he's too powerful here's my plan i'll distract him while you and then we ponies surrender and i might let you live never if that's how you want it charge bushwoolies yeah yeah yeah oh boy charge yeah bushwoolies like to charge yeah yeah charge charge let's go yeah uh-oh drop those wands nah i just made it get to the heart i'll take care of lavan

magic wands wow yay bushwoolies like it watch em close yeah i will keep this last one in memory of the bushwoolie who was lost in the jewel desert uh does anyone have any idea how we get out of here

earth and stone but we're back to where we started now but the castle's made out of stone can't you use your powers on it to get us in there not really the castle is magically protected i can't do anything with the stone in it unless i'm inside we could catch the castle without any trouble if it weren't for those creatures guarding it the undine and the salamander uh a water creature and a fire creature yeah them if we could just find a way to dry up the undine yeah or put out the salamander's flame we can it's simple i think she's heard too many fairytales no no it's a perfect plan we'll just use them against each other it just might work let's give it a go hey you undine your mother wears galoshes yoo-hoo salamander your fire's not that hot and neither are you na na brrr yeah okay let's go before the castle can pull away from these mountains again inside quickly oh this is so exciting boy it sure is spooky and confusing we could get lost in here real easy we need a guide i

mimic's so weak it's scary when north star brings megan she'll help mimic get well there they are sweet stuff surprise how's mimic let's hurry inside aww is that more comfortable mimic thank you cupcake hello mimic how are you feeling the twinkle is gone from her eys she's lost her appetite she hasn't eaten anything in three days no cough no fever her tongue isn't coated and her throat isn't red she's awfully pale but i don't know what's wrong neither do we it's not like any illness we've ever had could could it be magic magic that's it when magic's involved the moochick is the one to see i'll take you to him megan let's go just a minute megan i'm coming with you me too we'll all go with you megan i'm coming too hop on spike we'll be back soon mimic hold on hurry back and good luck there all safe and sound gee thanks wolves run for the moochick's cottage i've done it habbit help open up whoever you are go away go away i'm busy nduh no i'm sorry but this is an emergency wolves were after us oh ha ha hah no no no no no that was my wolf box oh but it was supposed to scare you away oh ummm mr moochick mimic is sick and we think it's due to magic uh-ah what she's lost her twinkle can ya help her hmmm well i'm sure i have something about sick unicorns in a book somewhere aha yes this book is the very one pony legends and history the legend of the four golden horseshoes yes of course ah mimic is descended from this unicorn long ago in the land of argyte four horseshoes were made of mystical starlight yes oh they were placed on the hooves of this special unicorn now each shoe gave her a magical power my my my the first showed the future the second had the power of blazing light the third made another's thoughts sound clear and loud and the fourth let its wearer float like a cloud deep in dream valley the wind left her at dawn and there she did stay for her horseshoes were gone that's all fascinating mr moochick but what does it have to do with mimic's illness well my my mimic is a direct descendent of that unicorn and the magic of the shoes still flows in her veins over the years the golden horseshoes have been carried farther and farther apart and because of that their magic is weakening that's why mimic is getting weaker where do we find the horseshoes in the land of screera it's said that the scree gaze upon one to see what will be okay we're going to screera now while you hunt for the horseshoes habbit and i will look after poor mimic won't we habbit here child this might prove of better use to you than me oh now dear dear dear well let's see i was about to turn yellow into blue uh i think oh of course poor mimic come along habbit what are you wasting time for it's over there that's screera if this is screera north star where are the scree they're all around us i'd bet five-to-one you'd come back north star i want you all to meet fleetfoot leader of the scree and watcher of the crescent of visions that was how i could predict north star's return isn't that cheating screes only bet on sure things but the crescent of visions did not show why you returned it's like this you see mimic one of the ponies the crescent fell from the sky it was a gift to the scree we cannot part with it that's the horseshoe but what can we do shhh i have an idea fleetfoot i challenge you to a race the winner gets the crescent on one condition if you lose you become my servant forever done oh poor wind whistler she looks so embarrassed come on wind whistler you can do it oh no oh wind whistler the crescent never lies it foretold that fleetfoot would win of course we scree only bet on sure things silly ponies so that's what's going on but they won't get away with it wolves scream my head's goin in megan what are you doing they cheated they knew fleetfoot would win and we need it for mimic's sake i say these ninnies don't play fair it's worth a try horseshoe of visions where is the horseshoe of light that's blarkland i've been there great show us the way so you want the horseshoe to save your friend correct we blarks collect keep and trade junk and riddles you have no junk so tell me a riddle i don't know and the horseshoe is yours thank you that's very generous uh why did the boy threw the alarm clock out the window because he wanted to see time fly tell me one i don't know i have a riddle what walks on four legs in the morning two at mid day and three at sunset uh a three-toed bullfrog no uh a dragon with gooseflesh um-uh a gyrating galumpadillo i guess not i give up what humans like megan they crawl as babies they walk as adults and they use a cane for a third foot when they grow very old very good cracker take them to the horseshoe it's here umm somewhere we'll never find it in all this everyone listen this horseshoe has the power of light so that's what we look for you mean like the one by cracker's foot i'll get it out uh-oh look out you saved cracker so i order a hole to be dug to the goblin tunnels there you will find another horseshoe stolen a long time ago from the blarks thank you for your help no problem you are all the blarks friends megan look the horseshoe is growing brighter we must be nearing the third one now what have we here won't ma be surprised we heard a scream what happened my hoof look at my hoof the beautiful polish has chipped all that fuss over chipped hoof polish i gave you the ancient recipe for polish made from glitter scent but did you use it then this is your fault starburst i did use your polish some princess ponies don't know as much as they think they know i know enough to be queen it takes more than just knowledge to be the queen right it takes the ability to appreciate the beauty in things which i have what no to be the queen a princess pony has to have a knowledge of every part of one's domain that's not enough starburst is right a queen needs to have a very special talent for understanding her subjects like me no no that is not what i was going to say hi what's going on i'm going to be the queen oh some shortcut we've been walking for hours okay let's try again which way leads to dream valley this way that way yeah that way you bet ah right okay what was that a light it was a light yeah it was i saw it yeah bright come on let's go this isn't dream valley no not dream valley no it isn't not dream valley no of course it isn't dream valley what is it then and who're you this is the royal paradise only royalty lives here i am princess royal blue a guardian of the magic wands really guardian oh my imagine that wands wands yeah it's true we are the princess ponies and it is our duty to protect the magic wands and it is your duty to come and judge the contest contest oh boy contest what's a contest oh boy what contest the contest to decide who will be queen you shall be the judge you'll probably pick me why because i'm the best qualified what you are not what makes you think you are you have some nerve you're so rude i don't believe you who should be queen well gee i don't think any of you really i mean you're all so good let's let the bushwoolies decide the time has come sludge yes master prepare for attack i want those magical wands now yes master right away master your wish is my command master i should be queen no i should whoever heard of the queen with dirty hooves i can fly and you can't so i should be in charge gee i remember paradise telling us the legend of the princess ponies and how they guard the magic of ponyland i never thought they'd act like this yeah yeah me too i agree never yeah it feels like an earthquake oh my what's happening oh it's lavan ruler of the lava demons run run run run run to the palace run run hurry run i'll take these ladies give me your wand i'll fly out of reach flying won't help you ah hey you can't do that is that the best you can do yahh hey what happened where'd he go where'd we go yeah go they're gone our magic wands are gone if lavan tries to use the wands he might upset the magical foundation of ponyland master i know it's not my place to ask but what are you going to do with the magic wands they have the ability to transform me into a crystal beam of lava's power the power to do anything what a wonderful thought to be a beautiful crystal creature you are a fool sludge beauty does not matter only power matters let the transformation begin something's wrong gwaaaaah if lilac would just get her hooves up out of the dirt and get on her way we'd ah now what what is it megan i don't know whatever it is it's bad i can sense that hey what's going on fizzy this is no time for jokes i didn't mean it megan it just happened aaahh it was warm a second ago what's going on i figure that someone or something has upset the magical powers of ponyland paradise the fireworks came from that way right away megan i'll go investigate sludge ready my lava board mm-mm-my lord the ponies fool i must capture the princess ponies to learn how to use the wand's magic what happened what we're afraid of ponyland's magic is breaking down okay someone's got to get megan and it's got to be you what are you doing head for paradise estate find megan the bushwoolie will show you the way you are all my prisoners gotchya now locket oh this is exciting faster locket oh oh catch it twilight oh i just don't know who to cheer for

while i tell it i'm in a hurry you know of course we can darling oh you poor tragic thing let's go so why do you need us to reach the floating castle see my true love is named ariel her father was a wizard who cast a spell that put her to sleep in a floating castle well come on we don't have all day he did this so only the man who is in love enough to brave the dangers of the floating castle reach the chamber wherein she sleeps kiss and awaken her will be good enough to marry her listen wouldn't we reach this floating castle faster if we flew well of course we would will you fly with me and tell me about about your true love and what you would do for her is it much farther to this castle it's here somewhere it moves around so we'll have to search a little okay we'll find it don't worry won't we locket locket locket hey i found something look there it is it's certainly large how do we get in i don't know i've never been this close before the legend says there are challenges to be faced well then let's go face them hey where'd it go did you see that i told you it moves well so do i it's too fast for me locket you try it's pretty high up heart throb if anyone can go that high

up we'll find a way in no we won't you ponies can't fly fast enough or high enough we can fly faster and higher than you can come on everyone make up now we all have to work together work together that's it if we approach from different sides one of us will be able to land oh that's brilliant yeah we could do it like this ready go hurray we did it let's go move in and land ah whoa what was that part of the wizard's spell i guess it's supposed to scare us away well it didn't work hang on let us pass ah oh are you all right you're soaked i'm fine maybe we'd better look for another way in let

circles hush we're inside the walls of lavan's chambers he may hear us i can feel the power within me all my senses have been sharpened what's that i thought so guards seize them our magic wands there they are not so fast we're trapped an ice org eh i should melt you into a puddle right here wait master there's no need for that quiet sludge or do you want another dose of what i gave you before then

paradise estate went haywire and then now let it be complete master what has happened to you power that is what has happened to me i've become the most powerful creature in ponyland okay follow me no

you bet not that your looks aren't important yeah important real important what's important that's important yeah important yeah i think we've all grown up quite a bit since the start of this adventure of course i also still think i should be queen you don't be foolish i should be queen that's absurd i'm the most qualified and you say lavan stole the magic wands yes oh he's a horrible creature i am quite aware of just how horrible lavan is no wonder all the magic in ponyland is turning bad mr moochick mr moochick whoa ow it's eating everything in sight can't you stop it mr moochick i'll try no i was afraid of this my magic's not working right what do we do that's easy run aha now what well i seem to recall something about oh no no no no no that wasn't it hmm what's he saying i

expected they look awful scary i've got to go talk to them good luck looking for your parents you want us to stick around nope these are my dragons i have to face them on my own good luck spike and what have we here if you please sir i thought maybe if it wouldn't be too much trouble you might allow me to join your band whatta we want him around for little pipsqueak like him would only get in our way wait you wanting to join a dragon camp is all very well but we dragons have certain criteria which must be met we generously offer to protect the citizens of a nearby village for a token consideration the selection of their best food stuffs and delicacies but the townspeople have been slow to respond to our magnanimous offer so a little visit is in order you may accompany us so that we can judge how good a dragon you really are help help you me yes you pick that up this isn't right this is awful we've gotta stop em come on let's go to paradise estate and then they marched back to their camp with all the food they'd stolen i think i'll just see what they're up to well my boy what do you think of the dragon life now terrific isn't it of course this doesn't mean you're in yet ya know ya might have more fun if you were more like my friends the little ponies little ponies yeah yeah the little ponies live in dream valley and play games all day and make cookies and cupcakes cookies and cupcakes and swim in the waterfall and pick flowers why we'd love to visit the little ponies take us to dream valley and you'll be one of the gang especially if they give us cupcakes

just havin a little fun no sense of humor boy some people what's the matter weston aren't you enjoying yourself oh yeah everything's wonderful here it's just that weston look mama daddy i guess i'll never learn how to be a grown up dragon now but if being a dragon means being a bully nah look how many different kinds of ponies there are earth ponies pegasi flutter ponies so there are probably all different kinds of dragons too when the time is right you'll find the ones like you you really think so well then maybe for now being here is the right place to be anyway i did learn one thing from the dragons yeah what was that everyone run for it you pushed me bagger no you pushed me smacker you both pushed me and now you're stinking mean oh dear ma everyone hide quickly paradise the
