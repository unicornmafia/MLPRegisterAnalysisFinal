Eyes over here, Spike!
Uh, sorry.
For this to work, it's crucial we keep
our concentration totally on the...
Ooh!
Spike! This magic needs
our full attention to make it happen!
There's no other way.
I can't help it.
Look!
Never mind her. She's just being Pinkie Pie.
Super extra Pinkie Pie today.
Twitchy-twitcha-twitcha-twitch.
Pinkie Pie. What in the wide, wide
world of Equestria are you up to?
Oh! It's my tail! It's my tail!
It's a-twitchy-twitching!
And you know what that means.
Actually, Pinkie, I haven't the slightest idea.
The twitching means my Pinkie Sense is telling me
that stuff's gonna start falling!
You should better duck for cover.
Oh, Pinkie. It's not gonna rain.
Weather's barely even a cloud in the...
He just said "Nice catch" in Frog.
Oh. I'm so, so sorry.
You okay, Twilight Sparkle?
I just couldn't stand to see
the pond getting so overpopulated...
...what with the frogs all
hopping into each other and all...
...so I decided to fly as many as I can
on over to Froggy Bottom Bog.
Of course you did.
Bye bye.
Um, Twilight? You've got a little
something on your face there.
Oh, really? Did your Pinkie Sense
tell you that too?
Nah, I could just see it.
Come on, Spike. Let's continue our practice
session where there's a little less commotion.
Wow! That was amazing!
Pinkie Pie predicted something
would fall and it did!
Oh, come on. She said something would fall...
...and a frog just happened to fall
right around the same time.
A coincidence. Nothing else to it.
My tail! My tail! Twitcha-twitch! Twitcha-twitch!
Something else is gonna fall!
Oh, Pinkie, please.
Nothing else is gonna faaaAAAH... Ugh!
Oh no! Twilight fell!
Is it... safe to go help her?
It's okay. My tail stopped twitching.
That was amazing!
Oh, please.
Uh, Twilight? Why are you hangin' out in a ditch?
Because Pinkie Pie predicted it.
Honestly, Spike, she did not.
Two coincidences in a row
like this may be unlikely...
...but it's still easier to believe than
twitchy tails that predict the future.
Twitchy tail? Pinkie Sense?
Don't worry. It's safe.
Prediction already came true.
Oh, wait. Don't tell me
you believe in this stuff too.
I know it doesn't make much sense,
but those of us, who've been Ponyville a while...
...have learned over time that
if Pinkie's a-twitchin', you better listen.
My ears are flopping! My ears are flopping!
What does that mean?!
I'll start a bath for you.
HUH?!
A bath? This thing keeps on
getting more ridiculous by the minute.
I get different little niggly feelings
and they mean different things.
Like when my back is itchy,
it means it's my lucky day!
And when my knee gets pinchy, that means
something scary is about to happen.
Is your knee pinchy now?
No. But my shoulder's achy.
That means there's an alligator in the tub.
How come your knee didn't get pinchy?!
That isn't just scary. It downright dangerous!
No, it's not, silly.
This is my pet alligator, Gummy.
He's got no teeth. See?
Okay, okay. I get it.
Well, I still don't believe
all this "special power" stuff.
It's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.
What's not to believe? You do magic.
What's the difference?
Huge!
For one thing...
Magic is something you study and practice.
It only happens when you decide to do it.
And it's meant to make something specific,
that you choose to happen, happen.
With you... it makes no sense at all!
That so not true, Twilight.
Sometimes it's a *bunch* of random things
happening to my body...
...at random times that
supposedly predict the future.
I call them combos.
Combos?
Sure! You know, like ear flop,
then knee twitch, then eye flutter?
That means the sky is about to
be graced with a beautiful rainbow!
Yeah. Sure.
Uh-oh. I feel a combo coming on.
Ear flop... Eye flutter... Knee twitch...
You said that combo meant beautiful rainbow.
Oh, nonononono. You're thinking of an ear flop,
then knee twitch, then eye flutter.
This was an ear flop,
then eye flutter, then knee twitch.
That usually means "Look out for opening doors."
You okay?
I don't believe this.
You don't believe, because you don't understand.
Okay. Now when you get another twitch...
...we'll have all kinds of scientific information.
Okie dokie lokie!
Any twitches yet?
Nopie dopie!
Now? Anything?
Wait! Hold on...
Uh, no.
Are you kidding me?
After a whole day of nonstop twitching...
...now that I've got you all hooked up,
you're not getting a single one?
I don't control it. They just come and go.
That makes no sense!
Sometimes you just have to believe in things.
Even when you can't figure 'em out.
I will not believe in anything I cannot explain.
Wait! Hold on... I'm feeling something.
Omygosh! What? What is it?
It's my tummy!
That usually means I'm hungry. Let's eat!
You know what?
Just forget it.
I don't need to know if this is real or not.
I don't need to understand it. I don't even care!
Okie dokie lokie!
Uh-oh!
Pinkie, have you seen Twili...?
Uh-huh.
Twilight? What are you doing back there?
Did you two plan this?
Plan what?
This is ridiculous! This can't be happening!
This makes no sense!
I have to figure this out.
Twilight?
Honestly, Spike, don't you know better
than to sneak up on ponies?
Oh! Sorry, but...
Um... Well... Isn't that what you're doing?
No.
I'm doing scientific research.
Pinkius Piecus) in its natural habitat.
Pinkius Whoecus?
There's something fishy going on
with the whole twitchy prediction thing.
And I'm getting to the bottom of it.
So shhh!
Come on! Pinkius Piecus is on the move.
Itchy nose.
Aha! That makes no sense.
See? She's hiding like something's
about to fall from the sky...
...but a twitchy *tail* means something's
gonna fall from the sky. Not an itchy nose.
This proves, perhaps conclusively, that...
Spike! Where are you going?
I'm trying to teach you
the value of scientific obse...
What's she doing now?
Smelling a flower.
Holy guacamole! I don't know what that means.
Probably that the flower smells good.
Wait! I'm getting something.
Ear flop... eye flutter... knee twitch.
Hold on...
You told me that's the combo
that says "Watch out for opening doors."
You really, really believe this stuff, don't you?
Here. Let me show you
there's nothing to be afraid of.
You see?
I promise you there's nothing
to fear from that... whoaaa...!
Twilight! You came to visit
my new apple cellar. How nice.
Twi? You okay? Uh, Twi?
Here. Let me help ya.
Okay.
Take this down.
Twitchy... tail.
Twitchy tail?
TWITCHY TAIL!!!
Hush, Spike! We can't let Pinkie
know we're here, remember?
Something's gonna fall! Something's gonna fall!
Run for your lives!
Ugh... Spike, honestly, you're overreact...
Hey, Applejack! Whatchu doin'?
Takin' more apples to my new apple cellar.
How about you, Pinkie? Whatchu doin'?
Oh. Letting Twilight secretly follow me
all day without me knowing.
You mean you knew all along?!
Why didn't you tell me?
Silly. That would have spoiled the secret.
Tail... still twitching?
All done. Clear skies from here on in,
as far as I can tell.
Oh no! What does that one mean?!
Dunno. Never gotten any like it before.
But whatever that shudder's about, it's a doozy!
Something you never expect
to happen is gonna happen!
And it's gonna happen... at Froggy Bottom Bog!
That's where Fluttershy's headed!
Oh no! Is it about her?
I... I'm not sure.
We better go and make sure she's okay.
Calm down, everypony. All we know right now...
...is that Pinkie Pie just got
a case of the shivers. That's all.
Hey! I thought you didn't believe in this stuff.
I don't.
I just want to be there to see the look on
Pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong.
Okie dokie!
Cold?
Need a jacket or something?
No, thanks. I'm fine.
So... what do you think happened to Fluttershy?
I hope nothin'.
I know, but... what do you *think* happened?
I'm tryin' not to think about it.
Me too.
But... I'm thinking about it anyway.
Like... what if... she exploded?!
Just exploded? For no reason?
Yeah! Like, boom!
Whoa!
I know!
What if... What if she exploded...
and then... and then exploded again?!
Can you do that? Can you explode twice?
Of course not.
But what if... she exploded...
and exploded again... and then...
Will you two stop?
She's fine. I'm sure of it.
I hope you're right, for Fluttershy's sake.
Look! There's Froggy Bottom Bog!
Fluttershy!
Fluttershy!
Fluttershy! You're okay!
Of course.
What a relief.
I'm so glad everything's all right.
Sorry. I know it's not nice to gloat, but...
AHA! I told you there was nothing
to worry about and I was right.
Pinkie Pie said whatever she was shuddering
about was a *cough* doozy. And... *cough*
And the only *cough* doozy here is how right I am.
Um... Twilight?
Pinkie's made a lot of predictions
today, but... *cough*
What is that smell?!
But what we've shown here is that
there's no point in believing... *cough*
...anything you can't see for yourself.
W-Well then, see what's b-behind you, Twilight.
I see it... but I don't believe it!
Is that a hydra?
Who cares? RUUUN!!!
Pinkie! Come on!
Oh! I'm so sorry.
Everypony up that hill!
HEEELP!!!
Coming, Spike! Hang on!
I think we're gonna make it!
But Pinkie's still shuddering!
Oh, lookie there. It stopped.
Ohhh, therrre ittt isss agggainnn!
He'll be up here in no time!
Quick! One at a time! Cross!
Uh, do you know any spell
for turning a hydra into a mouse?
No.
How about a squirrel?
No!
How about...
No small rodents of any kind!
That's too bad.
A hop, skip and a...
JUMP!
Wwwhoooa!
He's too close!
I'll distract him. You two go! Now!
Oh... What would a brave pony
like Rainbow Dash do?
CHAAARGE!!!
Tttwilight!
Tttwilight!
You have to jump!
I'll never make it!
You'll be fine!
I will not!
It's your only hooope!
You have to take a leap of faith!
No!
Oh no!
NOOO!!!
I knew you could do it, Twilight!
I don't know how it happened.
Coincidence, dumb luck or what.
But you said there'd be a doozy
here at Froggy Bottom Bog...
...and I'd say we just had
ourselves one heck of a doozy.
I mean, that hydra...
Pinkie?
That wasn't it.
Huh?
What wasn't what?
What are you talkin' about, Pink?
The hydra wasn't the doozy.
I'm still getting the shudders.
You see? There it is again.
Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bog,
my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened.
Huh... But I... WHAT?!
The hydra... wasn't the doozy?
How could it not be... the doozy?
What could be doozier than that?!
Dunno. But it just wasn't it.
I give up.
Give what up, Twi?
The fight. I can't fight it anymore.
I don't understand how, why or what...
...but Pinkie Sense somehow... makes sense.
I don't see how it does, but it just does.
Just because I don't understand
doesn't mean it's not true.
Yyyouuu mean yyyou bbbelllieve?
Yep. I guess I do.
Oh.
That was it! That's the doozy!
What?
What is?
You believing!
I never expected *that* to happen.
That was the doozy! Oh, and oh,
what a doozy of a doozy it was!
Oh, good, Spike. You're here.
Take a letter.
With pleasure, Twilight.
"Dear Princess Celestia."
"I'm happy to report, that..."
Spike. What have I been saying about focus?
I know, but I... well...
What's wrong, Spike? Never thought
you'd see me with an umbrella hat on?
Not really. No.
Pinkie's tail's a-twitching. What else can I do?
"I am happy to report that I now realize..."
"...there are wonderful things
in this world you just can't explain."
"But that doesn't necessarily
make them any less true."
"It just means you have to
choose to believe in them."
"And sometimes it takes a friend
to show you the way."
HONK!
"Honk."
"Always your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."
There it goes again.
I wonder what's gonna drop out
of the sky this time.
You never know.
Twitchy tail?
Holy guacamole!
I... can't... believe... the Grand...
Galloping... Gala... is... tonight!
Pinkie! Please stop shouting.
I'm trying to concentrate.
Pinkie Pie! Stop that right now.
It's time to prepare for the Gala and I refuse to
let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty.
What's Twilight doing?
She's got an awesome magic spell
she's been working on for the Gala.
Where are the others? It's getting late.
Hold your horses, girl. We're here.
Perfect! I'm ready.
For what?
All right, Spike.
An apple!
Are we having pie?
Shh! Watch!
Thanks. But that's just the start.
Fluttershy, did you bring your friends?
Yes.
Will they be safe, Twilight?
You have my word.
Ta-da!
Neat, huh? And don't worry.
They'll be mice again at midnight.
Opalescence, no!
Wait! Come back!
Those horses were supposed to
pull our carriage. How will we get to the Gala?
What ever shall we do?
Uh... ahem. Excuse me.
Uh, would you boys mind
pulling our carriage to the Gala?
Oh. Yeah.
Right.
Come on, you guys.
Let me in!
Sure thing, Spike.
Heavens no! We're getting dressed.
Dressed? Uh, beg pardon, Rarity, but, uh...
we don't normally wear clothes.
I'm sorry, Spike. Some of us do have standards.
I still can't believe we're gonna be at Canterlot tonight.
Our home town, Twilight!
And he best part is that we all get to
hang out together all night long!
Uh... I-I don't know, Spike.
We'll just have to see.
We're gonna be a mite busy.
Busy having fun!
Oh. Okay.
Don't worry, Spike. We'll all get to
spend some time together.
Great!
Cause I planned out my
insider's tour of Canterlot.
I've gotta show Rarity the crown jewels.
And Applejack the Princess's golden apple tree.
And Pinkie, we gotta go to my favorite donut shop.
Then let's get moving! Hyah!
Excuse me!?
Um... I...
If you weren't friends with our neighbor Rarity...
Wow!
You all look...
...amazing!
I can't believe we're finally here!
With all that we've imagined, the reality
of this night is sure to make this...
...the best night ever!
At the Gala!
At the Gala
In the garden
I'm going to see them all
All the creatures
I'll befriend them at the Gala
At the Gala!
All the birdies
And the critters
They will love me, big and small
We'll become good friends forever
Right here at the Gala
All our dreams will come true
Right here at the Gala! At the Gala!
And I'll earn a lot of money
For the Apple family
All our dreams and our hopes
From now until hereafter
All that we've been wishing for
Will happen at the Gala! At the Gala!
At the Gala
All the royals
They will meet fair Rarity
They will see I'm just as regal at the Gala
At the Gala!
I will find him
My Prince Charming
And how gallant he will be
He will treat me like a lady
Tonight at the Gala
This is what we've waited for
To have the best night ever
Each of us will live our dreams
Tonight at the Gala! At the Gala!
I've been dreaming
I've been waiting
To fly with those great ponies
The Wonderbolts
Their daring tricks
Spinning round and having kicks
Perform for crowds of thousands
They'll shower us with diamonds
The Wonderbolts will see me
Right here at the Gala
All we've come for, all we've dreamed
Our "happy ever after"
Finally they'll all come true
Right here at the Grand Gala! At the Gala!
I am here at the Grand Gala
For it is the best party
But the one thing it was missing
Was a pony named Pinkie
For I am the best at parties
All the ponies will agree
Ponies playing, ponies dancing
With me at the Grand Gala
Happiness and laughter at the Gala! At the Gala!
We will talk all about magic
It is going to be so special
As she takes time just for me
This will be the best night ever!
Into the Gala we must go
We're ready, now we're all aglow
Into the Gala let's go in
And have the best night ever
Into the Gala, now's the time
We're ready and we look divine
Into the Gala
Meet new friends
Into the Gala
Sell some apples
Into the Gala
Find my prince
Prove I'm great
As the Wonderbolt is
To meet, to sell, to find, to prove, to whoop, to talk
Into the Gala!
Into the Gala!
And we'll have the best night ever!
At the Gala!
Yeah! This is gonna be the best night ever.
You know why? Cause we're all gonna
spend time at the Gala to...
...gether.
Or not.
Princess Celestia!
Twilight! It is so lovely to see my star student.
Oh, I'm so excited to be here!
We have so much to catch up on.
Well, I want you right by
my side the entire evening...
...so we'll have plenty of time together.
That's just what I was hoping you'd say.
Hurry, Rarity...
Oh, but not too fast.
But don't wanna lose him...
WAIT!
Have to play it cool.
Oh, but don't be cold!
I can't lose him, I can't!
He's everything I imagined!
Even better than I imagined.
Oh my! A meadowlark!
I think she's calling to me.
It's exactly what I wished for!
Howdy, partner! You hungry?
As a horse!
Well, what's you're hungering for?
Caramel apple? Apple pie?
Apple fritter? Apple fries?
I'll take that big apple pie!
Well, thank you kindly, sir!
Yeehaw! In the first minute.
I made my first sale. Just like I expected.
Always hungry after a show. Eh, Soarin'?
Yeah!
Mmmyyy pppiiieee!
You saved it! Thanks.
Hey, no prob.
Hey! I know you.
You're the pony that saved us in Cloudsdale
and won The Best Flyer Competition.
Hay yeah! Name's Rainbow Dash.
Well, Rainbow Dash.
Looks like your skills saved us again.
Oh, at least they saved Soarin's apple pie.
Yeah...
Wanna come hang out with us?
Sure. Why not?
I'm... hanging... with the... Wonderbolts!
The shiny dance floor...
The pretty party ponies...
The fancy band...
Shiny! Pretty! Fancy!
GOTTA DANCE!
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gaalaaa!
It's all I ever dreamed
It's all I ever dreamed! Woohoo!
It's all I ever dreamed! Yippee!
I'm at the Grand Galloping GalaaaAAAA!
It's all I've ever... dreamed?
Well, hello.
I am Prince Blueblood.
I am... Rarity.
Oh my, what a lovely rose.
You mean...
...this rose?
Thank you. It goes with my eyes.
My little meadowlark is right around this bend!
Was that you?
Yep! I love whistlin' while I work.
Oh! Yes... Well... Excuse me.
Oh!
I see a toco toucan! And a spider monkey!
And, oh! Is that a wallaroo?
Oh, Fluttershy. You're such a loudmouth.
Hey, Spitfire!
You ever done a rain cloud double backflip?
You ever soared past lighting? It's awesome!
Welcome to the Grand Galloping Gala.
Princess! I've been so excited
to spend time with you and...
Yes. Me too, Twi... Oh, good evening!
Welcome to the Gala.
...which is why I...
Ladies! Lovely to see you again.
Looks like getting a chance to talk to
the Princess is gonna be a magic trick in itself.
First minute, first sale.
Second...
Fourth...
Sixth...
Sixtieth minute... no sales.
This ain't what I expected at all.
I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala...
...and it's not what I dreamed.
This isn't at all what I imagined.
This isn't what I hoped.
This isn't hanging out.
This isn't what I wished for.
No!
I waited all my life...
...for this moment.
And I'm not going to...
...let it slip by.
If it's the last thing I do...
...I'm gonna make this...
...the best night ever!
I just have to be more bold, like Twilight says.
I'm so sorry to have scared you, my friends!
But I'm leaving now, so you can all come out!
Gotcha!
It's okay. I promise not to hurt you.
I just wanna be your...
...friend?
Mmm... Sounds good to me.
Come on, Rainbow!
If they don't notice you,
you gotta make them notice you.
Just give him a chance, Rarity.
His princely side is sure to come out
if you're just patient.
Miss Rarity! Stop!
Oh.
Prince Blueblood! How chivalrous.
One would hate to slip.
Yes. "One" certainly would.
One's cloak should take care of the problem.
Oh, of course it will.
Come on everypony!
I know what will make you
shake those groove-thangs!
You reach your right hoof in
You reach your right hoof out
You reach your right hoof in
And you shake it all about
You do the Pony Pokey
Meeting lots of folks with clout
That's what I'm talking about
You step your left hoof in
You pull it right back out
You step your left hoof in
But you better help him out
You do the Pony Pokey
But you'd find a different route
That's what it's all about
You kick your back leg in
You pull your back leg out
You reach your back leg in
Just be brave and have no doubt
You do the Pony Pokey
Feeling like you're gonna pout
That's what I'm singing about
You tilt your head in
You tilt your head out
You tilt your head in
Then you shake it all about
You do the Pony Pokey
Even though your date's a lout
You're better off without
You stomp your whole self in
You stomp your whole self out
You stomp your whole self in
And you stomp yourself about
You do the Pony Pokey
And you give a little shout
COME OUT!
That's what I'm talking about
You do the Pony Pokey
You do the Pony Pokey
You do the Pony Pokey
And that's what it's all about
YEAH!
Young lady, this is not *that* kind of partay.
Ooooooh...
They don't want a party.
These ponies want a paaartaaay!
Two apple fritters, please.
Two apple fritters comin' right up.
That'll be four bits.
I'm going to have to pay, aren't I?
It's okay, Rarity.
I got you covered.
Thank you, Applejack. At least
somepony here has good manners.
Oh!
Fritters! Dumplings! Caramel apples!
My royal lips have touched common carnival fare!
I'm going to the buffet for
some... hors d'oeuvres.
Well, no wonder nopony wants my food.
They're fillin' up on all those
fancy-schmancy vittles.
Well, my down-home apples are
plenty good enough for this crowd.
I'll just dress 'em up a bit and prove it to 'em.
I'll catch you yet, my pretties.
Oh yes. As soon as one of you little birds
or monkeys or bears touches this net...
...you'll be MINE! MINE!!!
Come on, everypony!
You wanted a partay?
Now it's paaartaaay!
Yeah!
Now that's a beat, yeah!
C'mon, dance!
Yeah, woohoo!
Okay, all you high-class ponies.
Here's a highfalutin apple cake for
all your hoity-toity taste buds.
STAGE DIVE!
You, sir, are the most UNCHARMING
prince I have EVER MET!
Seems like the only thing royal about you
is that you are a ROYAL PAIN!
Ewww...!
Uh, stay back! I just had myself groomed!
Afraid to get DIRTY?!
This is my chance!
Yes!
Well... it can't get any worse.
You're... going to LOVE ME!!!
Run.
Ooh! Rarity, your glass slipper!
Now your prince is sure to find you.
No!
Let's go!
Hey, Pony Joe. Another donut.
Don't you think you've had enough?
Another donut! Extra sprinkles!
Twilight Sparkle! Ha, ha.
Long time no see.
Hey, how was the Gala?
How was your best night ever?
That sounds like the worst night ever!
It was!
I just hope Princess Celestia isn't upset
at us for ruining the Gala.
That was the best Grand Galloping Gala ever!
Princess Celestia?!
Pardon me, Princess...
...but tonight was just awful.
Oh, Twilight. The Grand Galloping Gala
is always awful.
It is?
That is why I was thrilled you were all attending.
I was hoping you could liven things up a bit.
And while the evening may not
have gone as you planned...
...I'm sure you'll agree that in the end...
...it didn't turn out so bad
for this group of friends.
You're right, Princess.
Friends have a way of making even the worst
of times into something pretty great.
Yeah! Hanging out with friends!
Talking!
Laughing!
You mean doing exactly what
I wanted to do the whole time?
Yes, Spike. You were right.
As horrible as our night was...
...being together here has made it all better.
In fact, it's made it...
...the best night ever!
Come one, Twilight. You can do it.
Okay. Here goes...
HA-HA! You did it!
Growing magic. That's number 25.
Twenty five different types of tricks and counting.
And I think this is the best trick so far.
Hello, Rarity.
What's that? Oh, it's the nothing.
Just my awesome mustache.
Sorry, Romeo. As attractive and enticing as you
look, it's just for practice and it's gotta go.
Wait!
Rats.
GOM Player is used by millions of
people around the world, find out why!
Twenty five, Twilight! Twenty five
different kinds of tricks and counting.
I though unicorns are only supposed to have
a little magic that matches their special talents.
True. For ponies whose talents are
for things like cooking or singing or math.
But what if the unicorn's
special talent *is* magic?
Like you, Twilight. And you know a ton of magic.
Oh, Spike, stop. I'm sure there are
lots of ponies right here in Ponyville...
...that know just as much magic as me.
Are you kidding?
I don't think there's another unicorn in all
of Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight.
Gangway! Coming through!
Snips... Snails... Wh-What's going on?
Why, haven't you heard?
There is a new unicorn in town!
Yeah! They say that she's got more magical
powers than any other unicorn ever.
Really?
Oh, no way. That honor goes to Twilight here.
Where is this unicorn?
Oh, she's in the town square. Come on!
Yeah! Come on!
Come on, come all!
Come and witness the amazing magic...
...of the Great and Powerful Trixie!
Watch in awe as the Great and Powerful Trixie...
...performs the most
spectacular feats of magic...
...ever witnessed by pony eyes!
My, my, my. What boasting.
Come on! Nopony's as magical as Twi...
Twi... Twi...
Oh... H-Hey, Rarity, I...
Mustache!
There's nothing wrong with
being talented, is there?
Nothin' at all.
'cept when someone goes around showin' it off
like a schoolfilly with fancy new ribbons.
Just because one has the ability
to perform lots of magic...
...does not make one better than the rest of us.
Especially when you got me around
being better than the rest of us.
I mean... Yeah! Uh, Magic Shmagic! Boo!
Well, well, well.
It seems we have some
NEIGH-sayers in the audience.
Who is so ignorant as
to challenge the magical ability...
...of the Great and Powerful Trixie?!
Do they not know that they're in the presence
of the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria?!
Just who does she think she is?
Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here is...
Spike! Shhh...
What? What's wrong?
You see the way they reacted to Trixie?
I don't want anyone thinking I'm the showoff.
So, "Great and Powerful Trixie".
What makes you think
you're so awesome anyway?
Why, only the Great and Powerful Trixie
have magic strong enough to vanquish...
...the dreaded Ursa Major.
What?
No way...
When all hope was lost, the ponies
of Hooffington had no one to turn to.
But the Great and Powerful Trixie
stepped in and, with her awesome magic...
...vanquished the Ursa Major and
sent it back to its cave...
...deep within the Everfree Forest.
Sooo sweet!
That settles it.
Trixie truly is the most talented, most
magical, most awesome unicorn in Ponyville.
No! In all of Equestria!
How do you know? You didn't see it!
And besides, Twi...
It's true, my enthusiastic little admirers.
Trixie is most certainly the best in Ponyville.
Don't believe the Great and Powerful Trixie?
Well then, I hereby challenge you, Ponyvillians.
Anything you can do, I can do better.
Any takers? Anyone?
Or is Trixie destined...
...to be the greatest
equine who has ever lived?
Please! She's unbearable!
You gotta show her. You just gotta!
There's no way I'm gonna use my magic
now, Spike. Especially since...
How about...
YOU!
Well, how about it? Hm?
Is there anything you can do...
...that the Great and Powerful Trixie can't?
I... I...
Well, little hayseed?
That's it! I can't stand for no more of this.
You show her, AJ!
Can your magical powers do this?
Top that, missy.
Oh, ye of little talent.
Watch and be amazed of the magic of Trixie.
Once again the Great and Powerful Trixie prevails.
There is no need to go strutting
around and showing off like that.
Oh?
That's my job!
The don't call me "Rainbow" and "Dash" for nothing.
When Trixie is through, the only
thing they'll call you is "loser".
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Seems like anypony with
a dash of good sense...
...would think twice before
tussling with the Great Trixie.
What we need is another
unicorn to challenge her.
Someone with some magic of her own.
Yeah! A unicorn to show
this unicorn who's boss.
A real unicorn to unicorn tussle.
Enough! Enough all of you.
I take your hint, but Rarity
is above such nonsense.
Rainbow Dash and Applejack
may behave like ruffians...
...but Rarity conducts herself
with beauty and grace.
Ooo, what's the matter?
Afraid you'll get a hair out of place
in that rats nest you call a mane?
Oh, it is ON!
You may think you're tough with
all your so-called power...
...but there is more to magic
than your brutish ways.
A unicorn need to be more than just muscle.
A unicorn needs to have style.
A unicorn is not a unicorn
without grace and beauty.
Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her.
She's strong, she's beautiful, she's...
QUICK! I NEED A MIRROR!
GET ME A MIRROR!
What did she to my hair?!
I know she did something terrible to my hair!
Nothing!
It's fine.
It's gorgeous.
It's green.
What?
No! Green hair?! Not green hair!
Such an awful, awful color...!
Well, I never...!
Well, Twilight. I guess it's up to you.
Come on. Show her what you're made of.
What do you mean? I'm nothing special.
Yes, you are! You're better that her.
I'm not better than anyone.
You think you're better than
the Great and Powerful Trixie?
You think you have more magical talent?
Well, come on. Show Trixie what you've got.
Show us all.
Who, me? I'm just run of the mill citizen of Ponyville.
No powerful magic here.
I... I think I can hear my laundry calling.
Sorry, gotta go.
Twilight?
Once again the Great and Powerful
Trixie has proven herself...
...to be the most amazing
unicorn in all of Equestria.
Was there ever any doubt?
Here's your smoothie you asked for.
With extra hay, just how you like it.
Hmmm... Hay.
Yes?
Oh, tell us another story,
Great and Powerful Trixie.
Yeah, tell us about how you
vanquished the Ursa Major.
Trixie is far too exhausted from
performing feats beyond imagination.
Begone with you until morning.
Of course, Great and Powerful Trixie.
Anything you say. We are at your beck and call.
What are you two doing?
Just bringing the GNPT a...
The what?
The Great N Powerful Trixie.
Sheesh...
Just bringing her a smoothie.
How can you fall for her lameness?
She's just a showoff.
Unlike Twilight...
The Great and Powerful Trixie vanquished
an Ursa Major. Can your Twilight claim that?
Oh really?
Were you guys actually there?
Well, uh... no. But...
But nothing! The proof is in the pudding!
I like pudding.
Look. Unless an Ursa Major comes waltzing up
the street for Trixie to vanquish...
...I am not gonna believe a word she says.
And neither should you!
And Ursa walking up the street, ay?
Snails! You thinking what I'm thinking?
Why is it they call it a flea market
when they don't really sell fleas?
Yeah, uh...
Oh, come on!
Twilight, would you put down
that book and just listen to me?
Didn't you see how they hated
Trixie's bragging, Spike?
If I go out there and show off my magic,
I run the risk of losing them as friends.
It's not the same thing, Twilight. You'd be
using your magic to stand up for your friends.
No, Spike. It's exactly the same.
Come on, Twilight. Any one of these tricks, even
the tiniest, would be enough to show off Trixie.
I don't wanna be seen as a bragger like Trixie.
But you're the best!
Please, Spike, I said no!
If that's what you wanna be, then fine.
Oooh... How we gonna find an Ursa Major when
I can't even see my own hoof in front of my face?
Hold on.
Oh. That's better.
Hey, guys. Where are you going?
Can't talk now...!
Got a major problem.
Yeah... Ursa Major, to be exact.
TRIXIE!!!
Twilight!
Trixie! Come out! You gotta help!
Trixie thought she said the Great and
Powerful Trixie did not wanna be disturbed.
We... We have a... a tiny problem.
Actually, it's a big one.
What is so important that you cannot
wait until morning to disturb Trixie?
Twilight! You've gotta come! Quick!
I've already told you, Spike.
I don't wanna show off Trixie.
No, you don't understand. It's...
Uh, is that what I think it is?
Majorly.
Great and Powerful Trixie,
you've got to vanquish the Ursa!
Yeah! Vanquish so we can watch.
It took a lotta trouble to get that thing here.
Wait! You brought this here?!
Are you out of your little pony minds?
But you're the Great and Powerful Trixie.
Yeah, remember? You defeated an Ursa Major.
Uh, okay.
Stand back.
Piece a cake.
Oh, come on, Trixie.
Stop goofing around and vanquish it, eh?
Well, that was a dud.
Yeah, pfft... Come on!
Where's all the cool explosions and smoking?
Stuff like earlier, you know.
What's going on?
We brought an Ursa to town.
You WHAT?!
Don't worry, the Great and
Powerful Trixie will vanquish it.
I can't.
WHAT?!
Oh, I can't, I never have...
No one can vanquish an Ursa Major. I just
made the whole story up to make me look better.
MADE IT UP?!
Nice use of number 16.
Call me, dontcha know?
That's new.
Unbelievable!
That was amazing!
Heavens to Betsy! We knew
you had ability but not that much.
I'm sorry. Please, please, don't hate me.
Hate you?!
Why, what ever do you mean, darling?
Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie's
showing off with her magic tricks and I just thought...
Whoah, whoah, whoah.
Magic's got nothing to do with it.
Trixie's just a loud mouth.
Most unpleasant.
All hat, no cattle.
So... you don't mind my magic tricks?
Your magic is a part of who you are, sugar cube.
And we like who you are.
We're proud to have such a powerful,
talented unicorn as our friend.
And after whupping that Ursa's
hind quarters we're even prouder.
You are?
Wow, Twilight! How'd you know
what to do with that Ursa Major?
That's what I was doing when
you came looking for me.
I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that
I was compelled to do a little reading up on them.
So it is possible to vanquish
an Ursa Major all by yourself?
That wasn't an Ursa Major.
It was a baby. An Ursa Minor.
THAT was just a BABY?!
And it wasn't rampaging. It was just
cranky because *someone* woke it up.
If that was an Ursa Minor...
...then what's an Ursa Major like?
You don't wanna know.
Huh! You may have vanquished an Ursa Minor...
...but you will never have the
amazing showstopping ability...
...of the Great and Powerful Trixie!
Why, that little...
Just let her go.
Maybe some day she'll learn her lesson.
Now, about you two.
Oh, we're sorry that we woke up the Ursa Minor.
We just wanted to see some AWESOME magic.
Yeah! And the way you vanquished
that Ursa Minor was AWESOME!
We deserve whatever punishment you give us.
For starters, you can clean up this mess.
And... What do you think, Spike?
Should I give them number 25?
Oh, twenty five, yes.
And I think I deserve it too.
I think you're right.
Sweet!
"Dear Princess Celestia."
"I have learned a very valuable
lesson about friendship."
"I was so afraid of being thought of as
a showoff that I was hiding a part of who I am."
"My friends helped he realize that
it's okay to be proud of your talents."
"And there are times when it's
appropriate to show them off."
"Especially when you're
standing up for your friends."
So, you finally admit that you're the most
talented unicorn in all of Ponyville?
Well... yeah.
But it's nothing to brag about.
So, uh, how did it go with Rarity?
Eh... She didn't go for the mustache.
You know, Spike, that mustache has
nothing to do with who you really are.
Maybe you should just try being yourself?
Or...
Maybe the mustache wasn't enough?
Maybe if I had a mustache AND a beard...?
Ugh... Not this again.
Okay. Imagine me with a nice,
long Fu Manchu-type beard.
Or maybe a goatee? Oh, no. A soul patch...
Where are you takin' us?
We're almost there, yearlings.
I've never been here before.
Ouch!
Oh. Sorry.
Are we there yet?
There? Where? What?
I don't even know what we're doing.
Here we are.
What are we lookin' at?
I have no idea.
What is that thing?
Cutie Mark Crusaders, welcome
to your new clubhouse.
Well, don't thank me all at once.
This was my clubhouse when I was your age.
Sure it hasn't been used in a while but...
...it's empty and on a secluded
private part of the farm.
And it's all yours.
It just needs a little, uh... TLC.
TLC as in Tenderly Loving Care
or Totally Lost Cause?
Applejack! We're supposed to turn
this into our new clubhouse?
Well, maybe y'all will get your cutie marks
when you discover your talent for...
...house cleanin'?
Wow! Hi, Scootaloo!
Back already? You're 'mazin' on that scooter.
Thanks! Wow, Apple Bloom.
You did all of this?
Yep! I've fixed the broken shutters, sanded off
the splinters, rebuilt the roof, painted...
That's so cool. What's Sweetie Belle up to?
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders...
...never stop the journey...
There you are, Sweetie Belle!
See? I told you we could find her
buffaloing her totally awesome voice.
What's that sweet tune you're singing?
Oh. I was just working on our new
Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song.
COOL!
Teach us?
Well, I've only come up with one part...
...but okay!
They all say that you will get your mark
When the time is really right
And you know just what you're supposed to do
AND YOUR TALENT COMES TO LIGHT!
Well, uh... I ???, Cutie Mark Crusaders.
You've done one fine job with this place.
So, what's next?
Well, now that we have a real life clubhouse...
And a map of Ponyville.
And a Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song.
Theme song?
We're gonna go out in the world
and discover our talents.
A new adventure!
And earn our cutie marks.
We'll leave no stone unturned!
No mountain unclimbed!
No meal uncooked!
No ???!
Well okay then! Sounds like you have a plan.
I gotta, uh...
Leave no apple unpicked!
See y'all later!
Are we ready to get our cutie marks, ponies?
Ready!
I have nothing to do with this.
What is going on here?
Well, we sure aren't gettin'
our cutie marks for bein' librarians.
Huh. I should think not.
What?
Girls, I think you're going
about this the wrong way.
Instead of trying to do things
in areas you're not familiar with...
...why not try doing things
in areas that you already like?
And I have the perfect place to start.
"Showcase your talents..."
"...for all to see..."
"Perform in the Ponyville school talent show."
There'll be all sorts of awards.
Best dramatic performance,
best comedy act, best magic act...
Surely you can find your talent.
This *would* be the perfect place
to discover our talents.
Jugglin'!
Acting!
Magic tricks!
Square dancin'!
Tightrope walking!
Tiger taming!
My little ponies! You're missing the point.
Think about the things you already enjoy doing.
Think about what you're already good at.
Sure! We could do that.
Yeah! Sure we can.
Well, whatever we do, we'll do it as...
...The Cutie Mark Crusaders!
Sweetie Belle! I told you not to touch my things.
Come back with my supplies!
We're just borrowing them for the talent show.
Don't worry, sis. I promise we'll bring them back.
Thanks, mr. Breezy.
We'll return the fan to you real soon.
What do we need this fan for?
Trust me on this one.
Okay, so that's six wooden planks,
4 by 8 plywood, a box of nails...
...four cans of paint and four brushes.
Anything else?
Yeah. Instructions on how to use six wooden
planks, 4 by 8 plywood, a box of nails...
...four cans of paint and four brushes.
"Ghost, goblins and ghoulish figures"?
Good heavens, girls.
What do you need a book like this for?
You'll see. Thanks, Twilight.
We'll give it back as soon as we're done with it.
What do you think they're up to?
I have no idea and I don't know if
I should be excited or scared to find out.
I'm glad we're doin' this as a team.
Me too.
Um... so what are we doing again?
A super awesome dramatic song
for the talent show, of course.
Right! We're still for cool scenery.
And amazing costumes.
And mind-blowin' dance moves.
This is gonna be so amazing!
Sweetie Belle, I think you should be a singer.
What? No way I'm singing in front of a crowd.
Twilight said to do something we like to do.
And I'd like to be like my big sister.
And she's a designer.
Fine then. You can do
the costumes and the scenery.
And Scootaloo, you're great
in maneuvers on your scooter.
So you should do the choreography.
You know, all those dance moves.
Nah. I'd rather sing a wicked rock ballad.
Why don't you come up with
the dance routine, Apple Bloom?
I'm not much of a dancer...
...but I do like Kung-fu.
That's kinda like dancin'.
Then it's settled! Let's get started.
One... two... three...
Ow, Apple Bloom! What are you doing?
Oh, I feel like I have four left feet.
I can't even spin right.
Don't be silly. You just gotta keep your head
forward until very the last minute. Like this.
See? Easy-peasy.
You just gotta practice a bunch, that's all.
Wow! That does look easy. Thanks.
Okay. Let's try this again.
I'm okay!
Keep practicing!
Will do.
We fight the fight, walk the walk.
Talk the talk, eat a... uh...
...food like a celery stalk?
I'll never come up with anything!
Never, never, never!
Come back! Come back!
Dumb fabric.
Hey Scoot! How's the song going?
Oh my! Sound serious.
I'm just no good at lyrics.
Coming up with words is, like...
...really hard.
Oh, it can't be that bad.
With our cutie marks we'll rock Equestria.
We use our stomachs to... digestia?
Well... These are... um...
...good, but... How about after
"We fight the fight"...
There is nothing that we fear
We'll have to figure out what we'll do next
Till our cutie marks are here
Wow! That's so awesome!
Did you just come up with that now?
Yeah... kind of.
Thanks, I'm totally using that.
Oh no!
One, two, three, four, FIVE?!
How's the spin coming along?
I think I'll gotta just stick to punches and kicks.
You know, ponies only have four legs.
I'll never be a designer like my sister Rarity.
Hey, it's no big deal.
Why don't you use the dress form?
It'll help you with your patterns and help
you put all the pieces in the right places.
Oh, is that what that's for?
Uh... maybe you should also clean
your paintbrush for ??? each color.
Oh, I was wondering why
all the colors looked like mud.
You're not using power tools, are you?
The talent show is just around the corner.
I wonder how the fillies are doin'.
Oh! Sorry, Scootaloo.
That's okay.
Ugh! Oops! Sorry, Scootaloo.
Ouch!
Oh, my bad, Sweetie Belle.
Let's sing the chorus again!
Well, gosh. Sure wasn't expectin' that.
I think that sound pretty good.
Me too. You think we're ready?
Ready as we'll ever be.
Hey! Did you see us practicing?
Uh... Yeah.
Well? How do we do? How do we do?
Uh...
Speechless! See, girls?
I told you that's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna leave them speechless.
YAY!
"Speechless" is right.
...and on a count of three...
...this rabbit will disappear and something
tasty will reappear in its place.
A one, a two and a three!
Hey! Where are they?
Snails, where are the...
...carrots.
SNAILS!
Uh, how about a round of applause
for the S&S magic act?
Now for our next act we have Sunny Days and
Peachy Pie reciting their favorite poem...
...on rollerskates!
Break a leg!
Sweetie Belle! What a thing to say!
No, no, no. You see, in a theater
it's considered bad luck to say "good luck".
So you say "break a leg" instead.
My little ponies! How are you doing?
Nervous...
Don't worry. You're gonna be amazing.
Remember, just stick to what you know best.
I can't wait to hear you sing, Sweetie Belle.
Why does everypony always
think I'm gonna sing?
Actually, Twilight Sparkle,
I'm the main singer tonight.
And I'm the main dancer. Hi-yah!
And I'm in charge of...
Costumes?
And sets and props. How'd you know?
Really, girls? Are you sure...
Cutie Mark Crusaders, you're on next.
Break a leg.
Break a le...
Ugh!
Uh... good luck!
Look, here are three little ponies
Ready to sing for this crowd
Listen up cause here's our story
I'm gonna sing it VERY LOUD!
When you're a younger pony
And your flank is very bare
Feels like the sun will never come
When your cutie mark's not there
So the three of us fight the fight
There is nothing that we fear
We'll have to figure out what we'll do next
Till our cutie marks are here
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders
On a quest to find out who we are
And we will never stop the journey
Not until we have our cutie marks
They all say that you'll get your mark
When the time is really right
And you know just what you're supposed to do
And your talent comes to light
But it's not as easy as it sounds
And that waiting's hard to do
So we test our talents everywhere
Until our face is blue
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders
On a quest to find out who we are
And we will never stop the journey
Not until we have our cutie marks
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders
On a quest to find out who we are
And we will never stop the journey
Not until we have our cutie marks!
Wow. That did not go as well as I expected.
I can't believe they're laughin' at us.
Was it that bad?
Back on stage, girls. It's time for the awards.
Back on stage? No.
They'll just laugh some more.
Yeah, what's the point?
Now girls, let's be good sports.
You made a great effort. You should be proud.
Now come on!
Let's hear for all our talented fillies and colts.
Our first award goes to...
Snips and Snails for best magic act.
Hey! Mine's at least shinier.
Well, mine's bigger.
Oh yeah, well... Well, mine is, uh... heavier?
The next award goes to...
Sunny Days and Peachy Pie for best dramatic performance.
And finally, the last award of the night goes to...
The Cutie Mark Crusaders!
What?
For best comedy act.
Can you believe it? We won!
I knew our act was awesome.
You know what would be the best?
If we won *and* we got our cutie marks.
Congratulations, ponies! Job well done.
Thanks, Twilight.
Hey, you don't sound too excited.
We worked really hard and won a prize
but we still don't have our cutie marks.
And that's the prize we really wanted.
Oh, girls...
But we think we know why.
Yes. We know why.
Oh? Tell me. I'd love to make
a special report to the Princess.
Well, maybe we were trying too hard?
Yes? And...
And instead of horsing ourselves to
do something that meant for us...
Yes... Yes...
We each should be embracing our true talent!
And that is...?
Comedy!
Apple Bloom! You did it!
Did you see our award? Weren't we funny?
One day... One day...
So sorry, Fluttershy.
I hate being late for our weekly get-together.
The usual!
But you will not believe what happened to me.
Is everything all right?
Oh, it's much more than all right.
I was on my way here,
wearing my latest hat creation...
...when who should stop me on the street?
But Photo Finish!
Photo Finish?
She is the most famous fashion
photographer in all of Equestria.
Anyhow, she saw my hat and said
it was absolutely marvelous!
What a lovely compliment.
She was so impressed that she wants
to take some pictures of my shop...
...featuring some of my clothes!
That's wonderful.
Do you know what this could
mean for my fashion career?
Oh, Rarity, I'm so happy for you.
But I'm going to need somepony
fabulous to model for me.
Somepony with beauty.
Somepony with grace. Somepony...
...like you!
Oh, goodness. I don't know.
Oh, this is such a huge opportunity.
And it would mean so much to me.
I'm flattered, really.
Nopony is going to have
your elegance and poise.
But...
Nopony!
There has to be somepony more quali...
Please!
Somepony more into fashion.
Please!
Somepony more comfortable in the spotlight
Please, please, PLEEEASE!
Oh, if it's that important to you,
of course I'll do it.
Oh, thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou!
You are the best friend a pony could ever have!
What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
Isn't it?
Though I was so afraid you wouldn't agree
to model for me that I felt completely frazzled.
I think I feel a pimple coming on.
Oh! Only one solution!
The usual!
Hm... She's going to want to
see attitude and pizzazz.
A-a-attitude and, um... pizzazz.
More light! It has to catch
the sequins just so...
...or the whole outfit is just a disaster.
Oh, and the headdress need more feathers.
Pinkie Pie! More feathers!
And sequins! More sequins!
And more ribbon!
Oh no! Less ribbon.
No! More ribbon.
Oh, this hem is completely off.
PINCUSHION!
Thank you all for helping me.
I'm sorry to be so short with you,
but I'm... I'm just so nervous.
Oh, doesn't that hurt?
Thick scales. Can't feel a thing.
And even if I could...
...there is no pain that would
keep me from assisting...
...the most beautiful creature in the world.
I'm gonna tell you two a secret.
But you have to promise not to tell anyone.
I promise.
Cross my heart and hope to fly,
Stick a cupcake in my eye.
I have a crush on Rarity!
We won't say a word!
Give me a break. Everypony
already knows how you...
Twilight! You promised Spike
you wouldn't say anything.
He trusts you. And losing a friend's trust
is the fastest way to lose a friend forever!
But...
FOREVER!
My lips are sealed.
Though I'm pretty sure Rarity is
gonna pick up on your feelings.
I, Photo Finish...
...have awwived.
Let me just say...
What an honor!
We begin...
...NOW!
Attitude and pizzazz!
Yes! Show Photo Finish something.
No!
Yeees.
No!
Yeees.
No!
Yeees.
ENOUGH!
She hardly took any pictures.
I'm so sorry. I tried my best.
Well, the headdress is too big for you
and cape had too much sparkle.
I can't believe I ever thought
*I* could impress *her*.
It seems that I, Photo Finish...
...have found a next fashion star
here in Ponyville.
Really?
Yes. Really.
And I, Photo Finish...
...am going to help her
to shine all over Eqvestria.
Tomorrow a photo shoot in ze park.
I go!
Did you hear that?
I am going to "shine all over Equestria".
Oh, Rarity. I was so worried
I'd ruined everything.
Oh, never. I knew you'd be perfect.
No, no, no, yes!
That is definitely the one.
Photo Finish is going to love it.
Everypony is going to love it!
Oh, I am so excited for you.
Just don't forget us little ponies when you become
the most famous designer in all of Equestria.
Never.
Put me down here.
Oh, nonononononono.
The model should be in something simple!
Something inspired by...
...the nature!
That's just what I was thinking.
Um... give me a moment and I'll, uh,
put a little something together.
Yes... that will not be necessary.
But... but... how are you going to help me...
..."shine across Equestria"...
...if I don't design something
new for these pictures?
I am not going to help you
shine across Equestria.
I am going to help *her* shine.
She is my star.
You! Go!
I can't, Rarity.
Oh, but you must, Fluttershy.
Photo Finish wants to make you a star.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
I know we were both hoping
it would be my lifetime...
...but nonetheless you can't
throw away this chance.
You must do this for me.
You must. You must! YOU MUST!
Floottershy!
It is time to make...
...the magics!
Oh, wunderbar!
You are like a delicate flower.
So much more alluring without
all those sparkles und feathers.
How'd it go? How'd it go?
It didn't.
Photo Finish wanted to work
with Fluttershy, not me.
Oh, Rarity. I'm so sorry.
Is there anything we can do?
I just vant to be alone right now.
You heard her. She vants to be... alone.
What? I didn't think she meant *alone* alone.
Too much blush.
Not enuf.
Too much.
Not enuf.
Perfiect.
Oh, yes! Even her schneezes are gressful.
NOW GO!
How do you feel? Excited? Overjoyed?
Frilled beyond your wildest dreams?
N... nervous.
Nervous? Dun be ridiculous.
You're only facing a large crowd of ponies...
...who will be watching your every move
and silently judging you.
Your cue! Now go!
You can't let Rarity down.
You must do this. You must. You must. You must.
So graceful.
So lovely.
So perfect for my new advertisement.
It's Fluttershy!
Wow. Look how popular you are.
I'm so excited for you.
You must be having the best time ever.
Oh, yes. Best time ever...
Flootershy! I have been
looking for you everywhere.
We have the thing at the place.
I'll see you at the spa. Our usual time?
Of course! I can't wait to hear all about the...
..."thing" at the place.
I'm the one who should be
mobbed by strangers wherever I go.
Welcome to Carousel Boutique!
Is she still here? We heard Fluttershy was here.
Sorry. You just missed her.
But you're still in luck. I'm having
a huge sale of some of my best designs.
And you are...?
Rarity, of course.
Never heard of you.
Obviously I, Photo Finish,
am fwilled to have found her.
Photo Finish?
She's a natural in front of the camera.
Um...
Photo Finish?
I only need to point to point
and shoot and I capture...
...the magics!
Photo Finish, I'm so sorry to interrupt.
It's just that I'm running late.
How could I have forgotten?!
Your appearance at the ballet opening!
Everypony who is anypony will be there.
Oh, actually I'm supposed
to be meeting my friend...
WE GO!
My hooves are getting positively pruney,
I've been waiting here so long.
Obviously Fluttershy's just too busy with her
new *career* to spend time with her best friend.
I'm sure she just got tied up.
Of course she did.
She's a big bright shining star!
I wish that star would burn out.
Rarity! Fluttershy is your friend.
I know, I know.
And I should be happy for her, but instead I'm just...
...jealous!
Oh, please promise you won't
tell her I feel this way.
Please, please, pleasepleasePLEASE!
You have my word.
Losing a friend's trust is
the fastest way to lose a friend.
FOREVER!
Wow! You look great!
Fluttershy may be the one who's famous...
...but that doesn't mean
I have to stop looking fabulous.
Rarity! I'm so sorry I'm...
Oh no. She's already gone, isn't she?
Sorry.
Oh, I can't believe this.
I am so frustrated I could just scream.
Feel better?
No.
Can I tell you something?
Of course.
You promise not to tell Rarity?
I swear.
Pinkie Pie-swear?
Cross my heart and hope to fly,
Stick a cupcake in my AARGH!
I don't like being a model.
No, I hate being a model.
All this attention is awful, just awful.
And I'm only doing it because Rarity
told me I must. I must! I MUST!
I must...
Oh, really?
Well...
If you wanna know the truth, Rarity...
Oh, what were you about to say?
FOREVER!
Nothing!
I was just thinking.
If you really don't like being a model,
you could always quit.
Oh, no. I could never do such a thing.
Rarity would be devastated.
But Rarity told me...
Mmm... Juicy!
Oh, if only all these ponies
didn't like me so much.
Photo Finish wouldn't want me to model anymore.
She'd find somepony else with...
...the magic!
I guess you're right.
You're right.
You're right, you're fight, you're right!
It's Fluttershy!
Don't you see? On her own, Fluttershy
could never do something unattractive.
But if I used my magic to help her do something
unattractive on her next fashion show...
...no one would ever want her to model again.
And if Fluttershy no longer has to be a model,
Rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her.
And I'll no longer have to keep their secrets!
It's the perfect plan!
You can't tell anyone about it.
Promise me you won't tell anyone?
S-s-so you do promise or you don't?
Uh, yes!
Obviously, that's why I...
Zipped my mouth closed, then locked it with a key...
...then dug a hole, then buried the key...
...then built a house up top the hole
where I buried the key...
...then moved into the house atop the hole.
Obviously.
You really think it'll work?
They love you for being you.
So all I have to do is make you *not* be you.
Just leave it to me.
Guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about.
Oh no.
Get her off the stage!
She's an embarrassment to all things fashion!
I, Photo Finish, have made a terrible mistake!
Bravo!
I say bravo!
Bravo? Who could possibly say
bravo to that horrid display?
Such attitude! Such pizzazz!
She's invented an entirely
new kind of modeling! Bravo!
Who is saying these things?
It's her.
The unicorn in the gorgeous cape and headdress.
Now that is a pony, who clearly
knows a thing or two about fashion.
Well, if that fabulous pony likes it...
...then I do too! Bravo!
This is awful. Just awful!
Somehow I've become more popular than ever.
Oh, I'm so frustrated I could just kick something!
If only Rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly.
But Rarity...!
Fluttershy! Are you all right?
I'm great! I'm a super famous fashion model.
Why wouldn't I be great?
Because you ha...!
Out there on the runway,
everyone was turning on you and...
Oh... oh, Fluttershy. It's so awful.
I wanted them to.
You did?!
Of course she did! Because...!
I'm jealous!
I wanted all the attention.
And instead it was going to you.
I even started hoping that you would do something
silly so your modeling career would be over.
But then, when it started happening,
all I could think was...
...how could I want you to fail
at something you love so much?
But... Fluttershy doesn't... Ugh!
Love? Oh, Rarity. I hate being a model.
You do?
More than anything.
Then why did you keep doing it?
I was afraid if I quit, you'd me
mad at me for not wanting to...
..."shine all over Equestria".
And I thought if I told you how jealous I was
of your success, you'd think I was a terrible friend.
Never!
All this time!
If we just told each other the truth.
I promise never to keep my feelings in secret again.
Me too.
Cross my heart and hope to fly,
Stick a cupcake in my eye.
You were brilliant. Brilliant!
I've already got six photo shoots
lined up for tomorrow aloon.
I'm sorry, Photo Finish, but I don't think
I'll be able to make any of them.
Wat?
We go!
Vat has just happened?
Spike has a crush on Rarity!
And you were doing so well.
Now this is a wonderful way
to spend an afternoon.
Isn't it, though?
"Dear Princess Celestia."
"Being a good friend means being able to keep a secret."
"But you should never be afraid to
share your true feelings with a good friend."
Did you get all that, Spike?
No. I did not.
I still can't believe you told someone
about my secret feelings for Rarity.
You're right. That was
wrong of me and I'm very sorry.
Apology accepted.
Now will you take down
my letter to Princess Celestia?
I would love to.
But... I'm a little busy at the moment.

Applejack!
Were you reading a bedtime story to...
...an apple tree?
Well, you know, bein' replanted in a whole
new place is very upsettin' for a tree.
And Bloomberg here is one of my favorites.
No fair, Applejack!
You've got a luxurious private
sleeper cart for a TREE...!
...while I am crowded and cramped
in a same cart with all the other ponies.
How am I supposed to get my beauty sleep?
But Bloomberg's the whole
reason we're makin' this trip.
He needs his rest so we can give him
as a gift to my relatives in Appleloosa.
You talk about it as if
it's your baby or something.
Who you callin' a baby?! Bloomberg's no baby!
Don't wet wittle Rarity make you all saddie-waddie.
Bloomber's a big and strong apple tree.
Yes, he is. A coochie-coochie-coo-coo-coo.
It's widdle Rarity, who's all saddie-waddie.
For crying out loud in the morning!
Do you guys mind?
I was up early fire-roasting those snacks
you're all eating and I pooped!
Speaking of, somebody's popcorn kernels didn't get popped.
Okay, fine.
Goodnight.
Maybe it's time we all got a little shut-eye.
We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.
Psst...! Pinkie Pie!
You asleep yet?
No. Are you asleep yet?
If I was sleeping, how could I
have asked you if you were asleep?
Oh yeah!
When we get to Appleloosa, you think
we'll have to carry that heavy tree...
...all the way from the train to the orchard?
What tree? You mean Bloomberg?
No. Fluttershy.
Fluttershy's not a tree, silly.
What's going on?
Rainbow Dash thinks Fluttershy is a tree.
I do NOT think she's a tree. I was just...
Did you say she was a tree?
No! Well... yes. But not exactly...
You know she's not a tree, right?
She's not a tree, Dashie.
I'd like to be a tree.
Oh, for Pete's sake!
Well, that was kinda huffy.
Huffy the Magic Dragon.
Could you all be quiet NOW?!
Bloomberg?
Bloomberg!
Sorry, but I tend to snore a bit.
Goodnight.
A buffalo stampede!
I just love their accessories.
They're getting awfully close to the train.
Ooh, looky!
Now they're going tricks!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Now do a backflip!
Or... just jump?
Hm...
Something tells me this isn't a circus act.
Hey there! Where are you headed in such a hurry?
Wow. You're pretty quick for someone so...
...bulky. No offense.
I just wanna know...
Hey!
I'm talking to you!
Wow...
I've got you now...
They've got Bloomberg!
Help!
And Spike!
Dragon-napping Spike. I'll show her.
Hey there!
Welcome to AAAPPLELOOSA!
Braeburn, listen...
Hey, cousin Applejack. Mind your manners.
You have yet to introduce me
to your compadres. Shame on you.
Braeburn, listen. Somth'n terrible's happened...
Terrible is right. Your train is full seven minutes late.
That's seven minutes less for you to
delight in the pleasures and wonders of...
AAAPPLELOOSA!
Boggles the mind, we settler ponies built
all this in just a past year, don't it?
And as you can see, we have all of the finest comforts.
Like horse-drawn carriages.
Okay, you pull now.
Eh, we just switched.
And now's there horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages.
Listen, Braeburn, I...
The Salt Block.
That's enough salt for you!
Can't I at least get a glass of water?
Over there is the office of Sheriff Silverstar.
And here's where we have our wild west dances.
And here's where we have our mild west dances.
But Braeburn, we...
And here is the most wonderful sight in all of...
AAAPPLELOOSA!
Our apple orchard.
Braeburn!
First harvest should be any day now.
Braebu...
Good thing too.
Brae...
Cause we need that grub to live on.
BRAEBURN!!!
Uh... yes, cous?
You have a very nice town n' all
but we have a huuuge problem.
Some of our friends are missin'.
A stampede of buffalo!
The took Spike!
Rainbow Dash went after them!
And we can't find Pinkie Pie!
And we had an apple tree with us
for your orchard, but they took that too.
Did you say buffalo?
Dem buffalo, they want us settler ponies to take
every single tree you see here off this land.
They sure as hay don't want any new ones added in.
But why?
Beats me.
We put a lotta hard work into this land so we
could feed our town, our families, our foals.
And now they're sayin' all these trees have to go?
T'ain't fair.
Oh, I can't wait to get my hooves
on that little buffalo.
Nobody tricks Rainbow Dash and get away with it.
Boo!
Pinkie Pie!
Oh, you caught me! Looks like I tricked you
and didn't get away either.
You're good.
Shh! What do you think you're doing?
You gotta get out of here.
I do?
You're gonna blow my cover!
I am?
I'm trying to save Spike!
OH MY GOSH! So am I!
And the more of us there are out here,
the more chance is of us getting...
...caught.
Run, Pinkie. I'll hold them off. Save yourself!
STOP!!!
Dash, Pinkie, 'sup?
Hey, no worries, I know those guys.
They're cool.
If you say so, Spike. Catch ya later, bro.
Seems they took me by mistake.
And they feel awful about it too, poor guys.
Fortunately, they totally respect dragons...
...so they treat me like an honored guest.
Still don't like ponies much though,
but you're with me, so it's cool.
Huh. Why, I still don't trust them.
I say we turn tail and bail while we still...
Before we finish eating?
Are you a loco in the coco?
Can I please have more of that
mushy stuff, whatever it was?
Certainly. And, Mr. Spike,
you like gemstones, yes?
Turquoise, mmm...
This here's Little Strongheart.
And these are my friends,
Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash.
You!
You!
That's it! We are outta here.
Wait!
Please, accept my apologies
for what happened on the train.
We didn't mean for anyone to be hurt.
Yeah, right.
We only wanted the tree.
The settler ponies have overtaken the land
and have planted an orchard all over it.
Because of their thoughtlessness, we can no longer
run over our traditional stampeding grounds.
Huh?
I think it's time they've met Chief Thunderhooves.
We have a long and winding stampeding trail...
...which we run upon for many generations.
My father stampeded upon these grounds...
...and his father before him...
...and his father before him...
...and his father before him...
...and his father before him...
...and...
I think they get the idea, Chief.
It is a sacred tradition to run the path every year.
But these year, these settler ponies, these...
Appleloosans!
They planted apple trees all over it
without asking our permission.
Well, that's not very nice. Right, Rainbow Dash?
The ponies refused to move their trees...
...so we are stuck here and it is not fair!
See, Rainbow Dash? They had a good reason to...
I'll say they had a good reason!
Come on! We have some apple-picking
Appleloosans to talk to!
Gently, please.
Sorry, Rarity. But our friends are out there...
...and we have to be ready for a long hike
into buffalo territory if we're gonna save them.
Let's go!
Hi, guys!
Pinkie!
We're so glad you're safe.
How did you escape from the buffalo?
We didn't.
We promised the buffalo a chance to talk.
Oh yeah? 'bout what?
We brought our new pal Little Strongheart
here to explain to the Appleloosans...
...why they should move
the apple trees off buffalo land.
That information would be quite help...
That's weird. Cause my cousin Braeburn
here wants to explain to the buffalo...
...why they should let the apple trees stay
That would a useful thing to...
The land is theirs!
You planted the trees not knowing that. Honest mistake.
Now you just gotta move 'em, that's all.
Well, heh...
They busted their rumps here! And now
they're supposed to bust their rumps again...
...just cause some buffalo
won't stampede someplace else?
Plant the trees somewhere else.
Where?
It's the only flat land around these parts.
The buffalo had it FIRST!
The settler ponies need it to LIVE!
Look!
Both the settlers and the buffalo
have good reasons to use this land.
There must be something we can do.
Hey! I've got an idea!
We may be divided
But of you all I beg
To remember we're all hoofed
At the end of each leg
No matter what the issue
Come from wherever you please
All this fighting gets you nothing
But hoof-and-mouth disease
Arguing's not the way
Hey, come out and play!
It's a shiny new day
So what do you say?
You gotta shaaare
You gotta caaare
It's a right thing to do
You gotta shaaare
You gotta caaare
And there'll always be a way through!
Both our diets, I should mention
Are completely vegetarian
We all eat hay and oats
Why be at each other's throat?
You gotta shaaare
You gotta caaare
It's a right thing to do
And there'll always be a way throoough!
Alright, Pinkie Pie, that was FANTASTIC!
What a great song, you're right on!
It appears that Sheriff Silverstar
and I have come to...
...an agreement.
We have.
That was the worst performance we've ever seen.
Absotively.
The time for action is upon us.
Our stampede will start at high noon tomorrow.
And if the orchard is still there...
...we'll flatten it!
And the whole town!
But Chief...!
And we Appleloosans say you
better bring your best...
...cause we'll be ready and waitin'!
But Sheriff...!
Oh... That wasn't the message of my song at all.
I want my kin to have what they need to live...
...but a storm's a-brewin' here.
And I don't like the look of it.
We've just got to talk some sense into them
before somepony gets hurt.
Listen, maybe if you would just reconsider, we...
About the trees, now if you just...
If we could just sit down and talk, we could...
Why won't anybody be rational and reasonable?!
Sheriff! If we could only...
Isn't there some way to stop this?
Unless the settlers remove those trees...
...I do not think so.
I know you don't wanna do this.
But they have taken our land.
What would you have me do, Rainbow Dash?
I don't know. But it's never too late
to think of something.
At noon it will be too late.
Come on! Think!
Thinkthinkthinkthinkthinkthinkthink!
He's not gonna do it!
You gotta shaaare
You gotta caaare
It's a right thing to do
You gotta shaaare...
CHAAARGE!
Ready?
Aim...
FIRE!
Yum!
Hey! I've got a much better idea!
We will allow the apple orchard to stay
in exchange for a share of its fruit.
Those... delicious apple pies.
I'd rather eat turquoise any day of the week.
Bloomberg, this is your special day.
Mama's so proud of you.
"Dear Princess Celestia."
"Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing."
"Even the worst of enemies can become friends."
"You need understanding and compromise."
"You've got to share. You've got to care."
Hey! That's what I said!
Not too fast now, Angel bunny.
You don't wanna get a tummy ache.
You really should eat more
than that, don't you think?
It's not playtime yet.
I know you wanna run, but...
...just three more bites.
Two more bites?
One more bite?
Pretty please.
Oh... goodness.
Are you okay?
Are you coughing because there's
a carrot stuck in your throat?
Because you need some water?
Because of that giant cloud
of scary black smoke?
I'll take that as a yes.
Help! Help!
Please? Help?
There's... there's a horrible cloud of smoke.
It's headed this way and...
Don't be such a scaredy-pony. It's just me.
Future Equestria ball-bouncing record holder.
246... 247...
This calls for a celebration!
Oh... No, Pinkie Pie.
This is no time for celebration.
This is a time for panic. For...
I'm gonna need balloons!
One for everypony in Ponyville.
There's... there's smoke.
And... and where there's
smoke, there's fire. And...
Let's see...
That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
...254, 255...
No, wait.
7!
Pinkie Pie! Now I have to start over.
We're all gonna have to start over.
In a new village. Because ours is gonna be...
Hey Rainbow Dash! Wait up!
Oh, please. This is an emergency.
I need everypony to...
Listen up!
Smoke is spreading over all of Equestria.
That's what I've been trying to...
But don't worry.
I've just received a letter from Princess Celestia
informing me that it is not coming from a fire.
Oh, thank goodness.
It's coming from a dragon.
A... d-d-d-dragon...?
What in the name of all things cinnamon swirled
is a full-grown dragon doin' here in Equestria?
Sleeping.
According to Princess
Celestia, he's taking a nap.
His snoring is what's causing all the smoke.
He should really see a doctor.
That doesn't sound healthy at all.
Well, at least he's not snoring fire.
What are we meant to do about it?
I'll tell you what we're meant to do.
Give 'im a boot. Take that!
And that!
We need to encourage him
to take a nap somewhere else.
Princess Celestia has given us
this mission and we must not fail.
If we do, Equestria will be covered in smoke
for the next one hundred years.
Huh. Talk about getting your beauty sleep.
All right, everypony.
I need you to gather supplies quickly.
We've got a long journey ahead of us.
Let's meet back here in less than an hour.
Okay, girls! You heard her.
The fate of Equestria is in our hoofs.
Do we have what it takes?
We can do it!
Um... Actually...
Oh... I mean...
Much better! Onward!
Let's go!
Um... let's not?
All right, girls. Listen up.
I'm mapping out the fastest route...
...but we've all got to keep a good pace if we
expect to make it up the mountain by nightfall.
M-m-mountain?
The dragon is in that cave at the very top.
Look pretty cold up there.
You bet it is. The higher you go,
the chillier it gets.
Good thing I've brought my scarf.
Ooo... Pretty.
Oh, yeah. That'll keep you nice and cozy.
Um... excuse me. Twilight?
I know you're busy, but...
Uh-huh.
Oh, we could go this way.
But if I could just have a second...
Uh-huh.
Now, we wanna avoid that.
So, um... I was thinking that...
Um... maybe I should just stay here at Ponyville.
Uh-huh.
Oh! Good.
I'll stay here and...
Wait! You have to come.
Your way with wild animals
will surely come in handy.
I don't think I...
Oh, and don't worry about your
little friends in the meadow.
Spike's got it covered while you're gone.
You can count on me.
Hey! Hey! Wait!
I don't know I think he's up to the task. Maybe...
But... but...
Are you sure you want
Fluttershy to come along?
I mean, that pony is afraid of her own shadow.
She's just gonna slow us down.
Oh, she's just a little nervous.
Once we get going, I'm sure she'll be fine.
All right, girls!
Move out!
But... but...
Wow... What was that?
That is what it sound like
when a dragon snores.
It's... it's so...
...high.
Well, it IS a mountain.
I'm gonna fly up there and check it out!
Hold on now. I think
we should all go up together.
Safety in numbers and all.
Oh, all right.
I hear the only thing that sparkles
more than the dragon's scales...
...are the jewels they use to build their nests.
If I play my cards right, I might be
able to convince him to part with a few.
Welcome to my cave, Rarity?
Care for a diamond?
Girls! This is no laughing matter!
Fluttershy, you're the expert on wild creatures.
What do you think the dragon will be like?
Fluttershy?
Hey! What are you waiting for?
An invitation?
Ooo! I think I have one in my bag!
It... it's so... so...
...steep.
Well, it IS a cliff.
You could just... oh, I don't know, fly up here?
Come on, Fluttershy, you can do it.
Flap those wings.
O... okay.
We don't have time for this.
What are you doing?
I'll need this if I'm gonna take her
around the mountain another way.
Uh... Around the mountain?!
That's gonna take them forever.
Don't worry, Twi. We'll be there lickety split.
WOOHOO! I win again!
Ugh... That's thirty-five games in a row.
Best of seventy-one?
We... made... it...
Told you it was gonna take them forever.
Your turn, Fluttershy.
But it's so wide.
Come on, Fluttershy.
We should be much farther along by now.
You could just leap on over.
I...
I don't know.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's just a hop, skip and a jump.
See?
It's not very far
just move your little rump
You can make it if you try
with a hop, skip and jump
We don't have time for this.
A hop, skip and jump
just move your little rump
A hop, skip and jump
A hop, skip and jump
Ahopskipandjump
Ahopskipandjump
Ahopskipandjump!
Okay. Here I go.
A hop...
That's it!
You're almost there.
...skip...
Just don't look down.
I guess I forgot to jump.
Let's keep it down.
According to my map, we're
entering an avalanche zone.
The smallest peep could
cause a huge rockslide.
An... an ava... ava...
Shhh!
AVALA...
Oh no! Help!
Everypony okay?
Thanks to you I am.
Let's do it again!
This is why a girl always
packs extra accessories.
Oh, please tell me I brought
a tiara that goes with this.
I think we've got bigger problems than making
sure our hair bows match our horseshoes.
Sorry.
Oh, no big whoop, sugar cube.
Yeah! We'll just have to...
...climb over.
My apologies.
Not *your* fault.
Still think it was a good idea
to bring Fluttershy along?
We're about to find out.
We're here.
Rainbow Dash, you'll use
your wings to clear the smoke.
Rarity and Pinkie Pie...
...you create a diversion to distract
the dragon if things get a little hairy in there.
Applejack, you're ready with
the apples in case he decides to attack.
But it shouldn't come to that...
...because Fluttershy will do what
she needs to do to wake him up...
...and between the two of us, we should be able
to get him to understand why he needs to go.
Is everypony ready?
Okay then. We're going in.
So, what is the best way to wake up
a sleeping dragon without upsetting him?
Fluttershy?
Oh, come on.
Come on!
We have to do this.
Now!
Every... second longer that dragon...
sleeps is another...
...acre of Equestria that is covered in... smoke.
I... I... I can't go in the cave.
Oh great. She's scared of caves now too.
I'm not scared of caves. I'm scared of...
What's that, sugar cube?
I'm scared of d...
What?
I'm scared of dragons!
But Fluttershy. You have a wonderful
talent dealing with all kinds of animals.
Yes, because they're not dragons.
Oh, come on! We've seen you walk right up
to a horrible manticore like it was nothing.
Yes, because he wasn't a dragon.
Spike is a dragon. You're not scared of him.
Yes, because he's not a huge, gigantic,
terrifying, enormous, teeth-gnashing...
...sharp-scale-having, horn-wearing,
smoke-snoring, could-eat-a-pony-in-one-bite...
...totally all grown up dragon.
But if you're so afraid of dragons...
...why didn't you say something
before we came all the way up here?
I was afraid to.
All of us are scared of that dragon.
I'm not.
Almost all of us are scared of that dragon.
But we've got a job to do.
So get in there with Twilight and
show her what you're made of.
I... I...
I just...
...can't.
Oh, Fluttershy.
I'm going in.
He probably just doesn't
realize what he's doing.
Right?
Mister dragon.
Excuse me.
Mister dragon.
Oh, good. You're awake.
Please allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Twilight...
...Sparkle and my friends and I are
residents here in Equestria...
...Ponyville to be exact.
We come here to ask that you find
another spot to take your nap.
It' just that you seem to be
doing an awful lot of snoring...
...and every time you do, you
send out a terrible cloud of smoke...
Equestria simply can't survive
a hundred years in a dark haze.
You understand, don't you?
So you'll find another place to sleep?
So much for... persuading him.
Now what?
Obviously, this situation just
calls for a little "pony charm".
Allow me, girls.
I'm so sorry to interru-hupt...
...but I couldn't possibly head back home without
mentioning what handsome scales you have.
And those scales have to be hidden away
in some silly cave for a hundred years?
Personally, I think you should skip the snoozing
and be out there. Showing them off.
Obviously, I would be more than happy to
keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone.
I was this close to getting that diamond.
You mean... getting rid of that dragon?
Oh... yeah. Sure.
What in tarnation...?
Darling, you look ridiculous.
Exactly!
Sharing a laugh is a sure-fire way
to get someone on your side.
Hi!
Apparently he doesn't like laughing, heh.
Or sharing.
Alright, that's it.
We've tried persuasion, charm...
...whatever it is Pinkie Pie does...
It's time to stop wasting time!
I'm going in.
Rainbow! No!
GET OUT!
Sorry.
How dare you?
HOW DARE YOU?!
Listen here, mister!
Just because you're big
doesn't mean you get to be a bully.
You may have huge teeth and sharp scales
and snore-smoke and breathe fire...
...but you do not, I repeat, YOU DO NOT...
HURT. MY. FRIENDS!
You got that?
Well?
BUT THAT RAINBOW ONE KICKED ME.
And I am very sorry about that.
But you're bigger than she is
and you should know better.
You should also know better
than to take a nap...
...where your snoring can become
a health hazard to other creatures.
BUT I...
Don't you "but I" me, mister.
Now what do you have to say for yourself?
I said...
What do you have to say for yourself?!
There, there. No need to cry.
You're not a bad dragon.
You've just made a bad decision.
Now go pack your things. You'll just need
to find a new place to sleep. That's all.
You did it! I knew you could do it!
I said, come back here!
How does Fluttershy put up
with you furry little things?
Spike.
Take a letter.
With pleasure.
"Dear Princess Celestia."
"I am happy to report that the dragon
has departed our fair country..."
"...and that it was my good friend Fluttershy,
who convinced him to go."
"This adventure has taught me to
never lose faith in your friends."
"They can be an amazing source of strength..."
"...and can help you overcome
even your greatest fears."
"Always your faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle."
Twilight! You gotta come see this!
She's just five away from a new pony record.
247... 248...
DRAGON!
Why are you laughing?!
That awful dragon is back!
Pinkie Pie, you scared me.
I mean... uh, you broke my concentration.
It's okay, Rainbow Dash.
Not everypony can be as brave as me.
No... nope...
Thank you kindly, Twilight, for helping me out.
I bet Big Macintosh I could get all these
Golden Delicious in the barn by lunchtime.
If I win, he's gonna walk down Stirrup
Street in one of Granny's girdles, heh heh.
No problem at all, Applejack.
But I'm glad, the goal is lunchtime.
All this hard work is making me hungry.
I know, right?
Oh really, Spike? You've been lounging
on my back all morning while we worked.
Exactly! You two were taking
so long, I missed snacktime.
I guess be better get some food.
Nope... worm...
Aha!
Oh, Spike! That looks delicious...!
Spike!
What?
It's a letter from Princess Celestia!
Hear ye, hear ye.
Her Grand Royal Highness
Princess Celestia of Equestria...
...is pleased to announce
the Grand Galloping Gala...
...to be held in the magnificent capital
city of Canterlot on the 21st day of...
...yadda yadda yadda...
...cordially extends an invitation
to Twilight Sparkle plus one guest.
The Grand Galloping Gala!
Having problems with your video?
Try GOM Player and play all videos!
The Grand Galloping Gala!
Look! Two tickets!
Wow, great! I've never been to the Gala.
Have you, Spike?
No and I plan to keep it that way. I don't
want any of that girly frilly frou-frou nonsense.
Oh, come on Spike! A dance would be nice.
Nice?! It's a hiccup more than just nice!
I'd love to go.
Land sakes! If I had an apple stand set up...
...ponies would be chewin' our tasty
vittles till the cows came home.
Do you have any idea how much business
I could drum up for Sweet Apple Acres?
Why, with all that money we could
do a heap of fixin' up round here.
We could replace that saggy old roof.
And Big Macintosh could
replace that saggy old plow.
And Granny Smith could
replace that saggy old hip!
Wow. I'd give my left hind
leg to go to that Gala.
Oh. Well, in that case, would you like to...
Are we talking about the Grand Galloping Gala?
Rainbow Dash. You told me you were
too busy to help me harvest apples.
What were you busy doin'? Spyin'?
No. I was busy...
...napping.
And I just happened to hear
that you have an extra ticket?
Yeah, but...
Yes! This is so awesome!
The Wonderbolts perform at the Grand Galloping
Gala every year. I can see it now...
Everyone will be watching the sky.
Their eyes riveted on the Wonderbolts.
But then, in would fly...
Rainbow Dash!
I would draw their attention
with my Super Speed Strut.
Then I would mesmerize them
with my Fantastic Filly Flash.
And for my grand finale the Buccaneer Blaze!
The ponies would go wild!
The Wonderbolts would insist that my signature
moves be incorporated into their routine.
And then welcome me as their newest member.
Don't you see, Twilight? This could be
my one chance to show 'em my stuff.
You gotta take me!
Hold on just one pony pickin' minute here.
I asked for that ticket first.
So? That doesn't mean you own it.
Oh yeah? Well, I challenge you to
a hoof wrestle. Winner gets the ticket.
Girls! These are MY tickets!
I'll decide who gets it, thank you very much.
Whoever has the best reason to go,
should get the ticket, don't you think?
Drummin' up business for the farm?
A chance to audition for the Wonderbolts?
Money to fix Granny's hip!
Living the dream!
Oh my! Those are all pretty
good reasons, aren't they?
Listen to that. I am starving.
I don't know about you, but I can't make
important decisions on an empty stomach.
So I'll think about it over lunch
and get back to you two. Okay?
Okay.
So who you're gonna give the ticket to, Twilight?
I don't know, Spike. But I really
can't think straight when I'm hungry.
So where should we eat?
Bats! Bats on my face! HELP!
Wait! These aren't...!
Tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala?!
It's the most amazing incredible tremendous
super-fun wonderful terrifically humongous
party in all of Equestria!
I've always always ALWAYS wanted to go!
Oh, the Grand Galloping Gala
is the best place for me!
Oh, the Grand Galloping Gala
is the best place for me!
Hip hip hurray,
it's the best place for me!
For Pinkie!
With decorations and streamers and fairy lights
and pinwheels and piñatas and pincushions...
With goodies like sugar cubes and sugar canes
and sundaes and sunbeams and sasparilla!
And I get to play my favoritest of favorite
fantabulous games like pin the tail on the pony!
Oh, the Grand Galloping Gala
is the best place for me!
Oh, the Grand Galloping Gala
is the best place for me!
Cause it's the most gallerific
superly-teriffic gala ever in the whole Galaxy!
Whee!
Oh thank you, Twilight!
It's the most wonderfulest gift ever!
Um... Actually...
Are these what I think they are?
Yes, yes, YES! Twilight's taking my to
the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!
The Gala!
I design ensembles for the Gala every year,
but I've never had the opportunity to attend.
Oh, the society, the culture, the glamor!
It's where I truly belong.
And where I'm destined to meet... HIM!
Him...!
Who?
Him.
I would stroll through the Gala
and everyone would wonder...
"Who is that mysterious mare?"
They would never guess that I was just
a simple pony from little old Ponyville.
Why, I would cause such a sensation...
...that I would be invited for an
audience with Princess Celestia herself!
And the Princess would be so taken
with the style and elegance...
...that she would introduce me to HIM!
Her nephew!
The most handsome, eligible
unicorn stallion in Canterlot!
Our eyes would meet, our hearts would melt...
Our courtship would be magnificent.
He would ask for my hoof in marriage
and of course I would say...
YES!!!
We would have a royal wedding,
befitting a princess...
...which is what I would
become upon marrying him.
The stallion of my dreams.
Twilight! I simply cannot believe you would
invite Pinkie Pie, so she could party...
...and prevent me from meeting my true love!
How could you?!
Hey!
Angel! These are perfect!
Listen guys, I haven't decided
who to give the extra ticket to.
You haven't?!
Um... Excuse me...
Twilight, I would just like to ask...
I mean, if it would be all right...
...if you haven't given it to someone else...
You?! You want to go to the Gala?
Oh... no.
I mean... yes. Or actually, kind of. You see...
It's not so much the Grand Galloping Gala...
...as it is the wondrous private gated
garden that surrounds the dance.
The flowers are said the be the most
beautiful and fragrant in all of Equestria!
For the night of the Gala and that night
alone will they all be in bloom.
And that's just the flora!
Don't get me started on the fauna.
There's loons and toucans and bitterns, oh my!
Hummingbirds that can really hum!
And buzzards that can really buzz!
And blue jays and red jays and green
jays, pink jays and pink flamingos.
Gee, Fluttershy, it sounds... beautiful.
Wait just a minute!
Rainbow Dash!
Were you following me?
No... I mean, yes... I mean, maybe.
Look, it doesn't matter!
I couldn't risk a goody four-shoes like you
giving that ticket away to just anybody.
Wait just another minute!
Applejack! Were you following me too?
No. I was following this one to make
sure she didn't try any funny business.
Still tryin' to take my ticket.
YOUR ticket?!
But Twilight's taking me!
QUIET!
...and then I said "Oatmeal? Are you craz..." Oh.
Girls! There's no use in arguing!
But Twilight...!
This is my decision and I'm
gonna make it on my own...
...and I certainly can't think
straight with all this noise!
Not to mention hunger.
Now go on! Shoo!
And don't worry, I'll figure this out!
Somehow.
Oh Spike. What am I gonna do?
All five of my best friends have
really good reasons to go to the Gala.
Applejack, Rainbow Dash,
Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy, Rarity...
Oh, who should go with me?
Have you made your decision?
I CAN'T DECIDE!
Twilight, he just wants to take your order.
Oh. I would love a daffodil and daisy sandwich.
Do you have any rubies?
No? Okay, I'll have the hay fries. Extra crispy.
What do you think, Spike?
I think we have to try another restaurant.
I mean, I like grass just fine, but would
it hurt anybody to offer some gemstones?
I mean about the Gala
and the ticket and who I should take!
Oh, you're still on THAT?
Spike, listen!
How do I choose? And when I do choose,
will the other four be mad at me?
I mean, I could give up
my ticket and give away two...
...but that would still leave three
disappointed ponies. What if I...
Ah, your food.
Oh, thank you. This looks so good. I'm sure
everything will be much clearer once I eat.
Um, Madame? Are you going to
eat your food in ze rain?
It's not raining.
What's going on?
Hi there, best friend forever I've ever ever had?
Enjoying the sunny weather?
Rainbow Dash, what are you doing?
Whadya mean? I just saw the smartest,
most generous pony about to get rained on...
...so I though I'd kick a hole
in the clouds to keep her dry...
...so she can dine at peace. That's all.
Rainbow. You're not trying to get extra
consideration for the extra ticket...
...by doing the extra special favors, are you?
Me? No no no, of course not!
Seriously, I'd do it for anypony.
Rainbow, I am not comfortable
accepting unwanted favors.
So I'd appreciate if you closed up
that rain cloud right now.
Fine.
That's better.
Twilight! It's raining.
No. Really?
Come with me before you catch a cold!
Oops. Sorry.
Oh no! It's quite all right.
After all, we are THE BEST OF FRIENDS,
are we not?
And you know what the best of friends do?
Makeover!
Ugh... Rarity...
There! Oh, you're simply darling!
Yeah... It is kinda pretty, isn't it?
And you! Oh, Spike. I have a dandy
little outfit for the dashing gent.
Oh, Spike.
Now you just need a hat!
I told you! I don't want any part of this girly
gala gunk. See you back at the library!
Oh, who needs him anyway?
This is all about you!
And how fabulous you'll look
at the Grand Galloping Gala.
Wait. The Grand...
And, oh my goodness, what a coincidence!
I happen to have an ensemble
of my own that matches yours to a tee.
We would be the belles of the ball, you and I.
Everyone would be clamoring for our attention.
All eyes would be on us. And then everyone
would finally know, the most beautiful...
...most talented, most sophisticated
pony in all of Equestria...
...is Rarity the Unicorn!
And Twilight Sparkle, of course.
I see what's going on. You're just
buttering me up so I give you the extra ticket.
Well, it's not gonna work!
You're going to have to wait for my
decision just like everyone else.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've been
trying all day just to get some lunch!
Did somepony say lunch?
You've got to be kidding me!
I got apple pie, apple fritters, apple tarts,
apple dumplings, apple crisps, apple crumbles...
...aaand apple Brown Betty!
The dessert. Not my auntie.
What'd ya say there, best friend?
Is that a yes?
No! NO!
I don't know who I'm giving the ticket to!
And all these favors aren't
making it any easier to decide.
In fact, I'm less sure now
than I was this morning! Aaargh!
So... that's a maybe?
I never thought being showered with
favors would be so aggravating.
Fluttershy! Not you too...
Oh! Well, hello, Twilight.
I hope you don't mind but we're all
doing a little spring cleaning for you.
It's summer.
Oh. Well... better late than never, right?
It was Angel's idea.
You're not doing this for the ticket, are you?
Oh, no! I'm doing this because you're
my very best friend! Right, Angel?
Yes. We are just doing this for the ticket.
No no NO!
Well, this is all very nice of you and Angel...
...but I'm not accepting any extra favors
until I've made my final decision.
So I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
SURPRISE!
Twilight is my bestest friend, whoopee! Whoopee!
Pinkie...
She's the cutest, smartest, all-around best pony! Pony!
Pinkie...!
I bet if I throw a super-duper fun party! Party!
Pinkie!
She'll give her extra ticket to the Gala to meee!
PINKIEEE!!!
Yes, Twilight?
At least the other ponies *try*
to be subtle about the ticket!
Wait... What ticket? What gala?
Oh, you didn't know?
Twilight has an extra ticket
to the Grand Galloping Gala!
THE GRAND GALLOPING GALA?!
Have I ever told you how much
I love your mane?
I'll wash your dishes!
Would you like any help with your gardening?
I have a cartload of extra carrots.
What are we gonna do?
We're... gonna... RUUUUN!!!
Warn me next time you're gonna do that.
I didn't even know it was gonna happen!
Not quick, lock the doors!
I can't decide, I just can't decide!
It's important to all of you and I just
can't stand to disappoint any of you...
...and giving me gifts and doing me
favors won't make any difference.
Because you're all my friends and I wanna
make you all happy and I can't! I JUST CAN'T!
Twilight, sugar... I didn't mean to
put so much pressure on you.
And if it helps, I don't want the ticket anymore.
You can give it to somepony else.
I won't feel bad, I promise.
Me too. I feel just awful
that I made you feel so awful.
And me too. It's no fun upsetting your friends!
Twilight, it was unfair of me
to try to force you as I did.
YES! That means, the ticket is mine!
I've got the ticket, I've got the ticket...
You know... I haven't perfected my signature
moves for the Wonderbolts anyway.
I don't need that ticket either.
We all got so gung-ho about
going to the Gala...
...that we couldn't see how
ungung-ho we were makin' you.
We're sorry, Twilight!
Spike, take down a note.
Dear Princess Celestia. I've learned that one of
the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings.
But when it's not enough
blessings to go around...
...having more than your friends
can make you feel pretty awful.
So, though I appreciate the invitation...
...I will be returning both tickets
to the Grand Galloping Gala.
WHAT?!
If my friends can't all go,
I don't wanna go either.
Twilight, you don't have to do that!
Nope, I've made up my mind.
Spike, you can send the letter now.
Now you won't get to go to the Gala either.
It's okay, girls. I couldn't possibly enjoy
myself without my best friends there with me.
So I'd rather not go at all.
Well, wallop my withers, Spike. Isn't that just like
a boy. Can't handle the least bit of sentiment.
Whoah, Nelly!
A letter from the Princess? That was fast!
My faithful student Twilight.
Why didn't you just say so in the first place?
Six tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala!
Now we can all go!
Allow us to treat you to dinner.
What a great way to apologise!
And to celebrate! Come on, everyone!
The cupcakes are on me.
How come I don't get a ticket to the Gala?
And one for you, Spike.
I mean... gross! I have to go too?
Now, what have we learned?
Lots of control...
Good.
Screaming and hollering...
Yes. And most importantly...
Passion!
Right!
So now that you know the elements
of a good cheer, let's hear one!
Yay.
You're gonna cheer for me like that?
Louder.
Yay.
Louder!
Yay.
LOUDER!!!
Yaaay.
Too loud?
Yay.
And now, phase one of my routine...
Woo...
Phase two...
Way to go.
Here we go. Phase three...
The sonic rainboom!
Come on!
Uh-oh.
Last one.
Thank you so much for helping me
clean up all these books, guys.
It was a crazy weekend of studying.
Rainbow Dash, you rock.
Woohoo.
Did my cheering do that?
Sorry about that, ladies.
That was a truly feeble performance.
Actually, it wasn't all bad. I particularly
liked it when you made the clouds spin.
I'm not talking about my performance.
I'm talking about yours.
That feeble cheering.
What are you two arguing about?
Were we arguing? I'm sorry.
I wish you guys could come to Cloudsdale to see
me competing in the Best Young Flyer Competition.
What's that?
It's where all the greatest
pegasus flyers get together...
...and show off their different flying styles!
Some are fast!
And some are graceful.
Golly! I'd love to see you strut
your stuff in that competition.
Yeah. I wish you guys could be there.
Fluttershy is a great support,
but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational.
Ooh! I'd love to see you make a sonic rainboom!
It's, like, the most coolest thing ever!
Even though I've never actually seen it,
but, I mean, come on, it's a sonic rainboom!
How not cool could it possibly not be?
What's a "sonic rainboom"?
You really need to get out more.
The sonic rainboom is legendary!
When a pegasus like Rainbow Dash
gets going so fast...
Boom!
...a sonic boom and a rainbow
can happen all at once!
And Rainbow Dash here's
the only pony to ever pull it off.
It was a long time ago. I was just a filly.
Yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right?
A-are you kidding?
I'm the greatest flyer
to ever come out of Cloudsdale.
I could do sonic rainbooms in my sleep.
Wow. If you pull that off,
you'll win the crown for sure.
The grand prize is an entire
day with the Wonderbolts.
A whole day of flying with my lifelong heroes.
It'll be a dream come true!
Yay.
I'm gonna go rest up.
Don't wanna overprepare myself, you know.
You, on the other hand, better keep practicing.
I need a cheering section to match
my spectacular performance.
She's practiced that move a hundred times
and she's never even come close to doing it.
I don't know if I can
cheer loud enough to help her.
Well, guess we better get this cleaned up.
Again.
Go on, go on.
Go on what?
Find a spell that will get us
wingless ponies into Cloudsdale.
Didn't you see how nervous she was?
Nervous?! Have you spit your bit or someth'n?
She was tootin' her own horn louder
than the brass section of a marchin' band.
Oh, please.
I've put on enough fashion shows
to recognize stage fright when I see it.
You've got to find a way to be there for her.
Now go on!
How am I supposed to find
a flight spell in this mess?
A flight spell? One sec.
Page 27.
How'd you do that?
It landed on my face when Rainbow Dash
knocked me into the bookcase.
Here it is!
A spell that will allow earth ponies
to fly for three days.
Ooh... It looks really difficult.
I'm not sure I can do it.
You've got to try.
Okay. But who's gonna volunteer
to be the test subject?
I will!
For Rainbow Dash, I will go first.
Here goes...
I think it worked.
You've got to learn to be assertive, Fluttershy.
Don't be afraid to speak up.
Well, well, well. What do we have here?
It's our old friend, Rainbow Crash!
Get kicked out of any flight schools lately?
I didn't get kicked out.
Face it, Rainbow Crash. Flight school had
too many rules and not enough naptimes for you.
Huh. Ask her about the sonic rainboom!
That's nothing but an old mares' tale.
You don't have the skills
to try something like that.
Now wait just a minute!
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm trying to be more assertive.
Anyhow, she *is* going to do a sonic rainboom.
No, she's not, cause there's no such thing.
The show up at the Cloudiseum
and see for yourself.
...if you're free.
Yeah, I'll be free.
Oh, don't worry. We'll be there.
See you then, Rainbow Crash!
Did you see that? I was so assertive.
Those guys are right. I'll never be able to do it.
But Rainbow Dash...
...just because you failed the sonic rainboom
a hundred thousand times in practice...
...doesn't mean you won't be able
to do it in front of an entire stadium...
...full of impatient,
super-critical sports fan ponies.
What do I do?! Everypony's gonna see me fail!
The Wonderbolts will never
let a loser like me join.
Princess Celestia will probably
banish me to the Everfree Forest!
MY LIFE IS RUINED!!!
Rar...
Rare? The sonic rainboom is way more than rare!
Rarity?
Rarity! Are you...
...flying?
I most certainly am!
Aren't my wings smashing?
Twilight made them for me. I just adore them!
Why so shocked?
We couldn't leave our favorite flyer
without a big cheering section.
"We"?
I... I can't believe it!
It's incredible.
This is so cool! You guys made it!
Sure did!
WAIT!
How'd you do that? Only
pegasus ponies can walk on clouds.
Pretty cool, huh?
I found a spell that makes temporary wings...
...but it was too difficult to do more than once.
So I found an easier spell that
lets the rest of us walk on clouds.
And we came to cheer you to victory.
To be honest, I *was* starting to get
just a teeniest, tiniest bit nervous.
But I feel a lot better now
that you guys are here.
Hey! We've got some time before the competition.
Why don't Fluttershy and I
show you around Cloudsdale?
Here it is. The greatest city in the sky!
Some of the greatest pegasi
in history came from Cloudsdale.
Oh! Wait for me!
Those wings are gorgeous!
Oh, why thank you.
Be careful with those wings, Rarity.
They're made from gossamer and morning dew.
And they're incredibly delicate.
Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure they can't get
worn out from too much attention.
Since we're up here, I'd sure like to get
a look at where the weather's made.
Great idea! Come on, girls!
To the weather factory!
This is where they make the snowflakes.
Each one is hoofmade, as you could see.
It's a delicate operation.
Ooh! The snowflakes look even better from up here.
We better move on before Rarity
ruins winter and causes a drought.
And here's where they make the rainbows.
Spicy...!
Yeah. Rainbows aren't really
known for their flavor.
Where'd you get those
amazing wings? I want a pair.
Yeah, I guess I could see that.
Oh hey, look! It's Rainbow Crash again.
Yeah! Rainbow...
...Crash!
Rarity! What are you doing
talking to *these* guys?
Oh, they were just admiring
my wings, Rainbow Dash.
Yeah. You should forget the sonic rainboom
and just get yourself some wings like these.
Oh. Come on, girls.
Why don't we go see how clouds are made?
Don't listen to them. You're gonna
win that competition for sure.
Are you kidding? I can't do the sonic rainboom.
And just look at these boring
plain old feathered wings.
I'm doomed.
Why, these old things?
Go ahead, everypony. Photos are encouraged.
Rarity! We're supposed to be helping
Rainbow Dash relax, remember?
Put your wings away and stop showing off.
Oh. How can you ask me to put away perfection?
Rainbow Dash, are you okay?
You don't look so good.
Of course! Why wouldn't I be okay?
Everyone's so in love of Rarity's wings
that they won't even notice...
...when I totally BLOW IT
in the Best Young Flyer's Competition.
Hey! There's an idea!
*You* should enter the competition.
Yeah. I could watch you fly all day long.
There really isn't anypony
who uses their wings quite like me.
Perhaps I should compete.
What?!
What am I gonna do?!
I'll never win the competition now.
I'm going to be a while.
Fillies and gentlecolts!
Please rise and join me...
...in welcoming our beloved Princess Celestia!
Please welcome our celebrity judges
for the Best Young Flyer Competition...
...the Wonderbolts!
And now let's find out who will take the prize...
...as this year's Best Young Flyer.
Okay, contestant number one. You're up.
Okay, number two. Let's go.
Um...
Come on, come on. We ain't got all day.
She's talking to you.
Oh! Uh...
Oh, I guess that's me.
Okay, number four. Time to go.
I'm number four and I need
just one more itsy bitsy minute.
Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hm?
Look. I don't care who it is,
but somepony's gotta go on.
LET'S DO THIS!
What am I gonna do?!
I loved number seven. Doing fifteen
barrel rolls in a row can't be easy.
My favorite is number ten.
She just looks like such a nice pony.
Hm. Wonder how come we haven't
seen Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet.
The competition's almost over.
Number fifteen, let's go.
Rarity...
...is ready!
Look, ladies, I don't know what to tell you.
There's only time for one more performance.
If you both wanna compete, you'll
just have to go out there together.
Well, Rainbow Dash? Shall we?
And now, for our final competitor of the day...
...contestant number fifteen!
Uh... and apparently contestant number four.
Good luck, Rainbow Dash. Just do your best.
I hope you don't mind, but I took
the liberty of changing our music.
That rock and roll doesn't really match my wings.
Come on, Rainbow Dash. You can do this.
Just remember the routine.
Phase one...
Nice work, Rainbow Crash!
Time for phase two.
Look. Phase two is working.
And now, for my grand finale, I
will fly right up to the sun...
...and beam my beautiful wings
over the whole city of Cloudsdale.
Oh, they'll be talking about it for years!
Looks like this is my last chance
to turn things around.
the sonic...
...rainboom.
Wings, don't fail me now.
Look upon me, Equestria!
For I am Rarity!
Uh-oh.
Oh no! Her wings evaporated into thin air!
Hold on, Rarity!
I'm coming!
I can't look.
A SONIC RAINBOOM!!!
SHE DID IT! SHE DID IT! WAAAH!
Whoa...
A SONIC RAINBOOM!!!
YEAH!!! YES!!!
I did it. I did it!
You sure did.
Oh, thank you, Rainbow Dash. You saved my life.
Oh yeah. I did that too.
Best day ever!
I want to apologize to all of you
for getting so carried away with my...
...beautiful wings.
I guess I just lost my head.
It's okay.
Oh, don't worry about it, kiddo.
We still love you.
And then especially sorry
that I was so thoughtless...
...as to jump into the contest at the last minute
after you would work so hard to win it.
Can you ever ever forgive me?
Oh, it's okay. Everything
turned our all right, right?
I just wish I could have met
the Wonderbolts when they were awake.
Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh...!
So you're the little pony who saved our lives?
We really wanted to meet you and say thanks.
...ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh...
Princess!
Hello, Twilight Sparkle. And hello to your friends too.
Princess Celestia. I am sorry I ruined the competition.
Rainbow Dash here really is the best flyer in Equestria.
I know she is, my dear.
That's why, for her incredible act of bravery
and a spectacular sonic rainboom...
...I'm presenting the grand prize
for Best Young Flyer to this year's winner...
...Miss Rainbow Dash!
...ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmy
goshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
So, Twilight Sparkle. Did you learn anything
about friendship from this experience?
I did, Princess. But I think Rarity
learned even more than me.
I certainly did.
I learned how important it is to
keep your hooves on the ground...
...and be there for your friends.
Excellent. Well done, Rarity.
This really is the best day ever!
Uh... Hey, Rainbow Crash...
Dash!
Oh! Uh... Sorry. Rainbow Dash.
Uh, we just wanted to congratulate you
on winning the competition.
That sonic rainboom was awesome!
Thanks, guys.
Uh, we're really sorry we gave you
such a hard time before.
Aw, that's okay. Don't worry about it.
Hey, do you wanna hang out with us?
Maybe you could show us
how you did that incredible trick?
Sorry, boys...
...but I've got plans.
There you go, Mr. Mousey.
Now you stay off that leg
and do everything I told you.
And it will be just like new in no time at all.
Oh, you're welcome. Happy to be able to help.
You... found a watch?
You... wanna be a watch?
You're running!
Running out of time?
No. You're... late?
Want sharper video quality? Want
clearer audio? Try GOM Player now!
I'm late for a very important date!
The big brunch for Princess Celestia
at Sugarcube Corner.
Oh, the Princess is here
in Ponyville for a party...
...and we all promised we'd be there.
But I'm not there!
Oh, do I look all right?
Do I need to bring anything?
Maybe I shouldn't go?
It's starting! I'm missing it!
Oh, thanks, Angel.
I mean, if if you hadn't reminded me,
I might have not remembered and then...
...then I wouldn't be there and everypony
would be wondering where I was and...
Oh, right. I'm late.
Oh, okay then. See you later.
So... what do I have to do to get to be
one of the Princess's royal guards, anyway?
Is the pay good?
Hellooo! Anybody home?
Ooh, you're good.
Too good. I'm bored.
Made it.
Halt!
Who goes there?
No one. Never mind. I'll go home.
It's all right, sirs. She's on the list.
Thanks, Twilight.
I'm so glad you could make it, Fluttershy.
It wouldn't be the same without you.
How's everypony doing? Good? Good.
Anything else we can get for you, dearies...?
Ooh, I-I mean, esteemed guests.
Everything is fine, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.
Sorry I'm late. I had to finish
taking care of a patient first.
Oh, you and your Tender Loving Care of little animals.
I just know Princess Celestia is gonna love that about you.
I mean, I hope she will...
I mean, of course she will!
Wow, Twilight. I thought I was the only one
who got nervous at social gatherings.
Oh, it's not that. I just want the Princess
to approve of my friends.
But she's met us all before.
And read about you an my letters.
But this is the first time she spent any real time with you.
I want everypony to make a good impression.
Well, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
Besides, it's just a casual get-together, right?
Don't touch me!
Watch the dress!
Careful, you're gonna spill that on me!
Oh, oh, that looks delicious. What is it?
Oh, does it stain?! Keep it away from me!
Or... perhaps not that casual.
Uh... which is the salad
and which is the appetizer again?
And which am I supposed to eat first?
Oh, never mind. I'm not hungry.
It's okay, Twilight. So our friends' manners aren't perfect.
I doubt the Princess will even notice.
Cookies, candies and pies! Oh my!
Chocolate Fountainy goodness!
You gonna eat that?!
Hey!
A thousand pardons, Your Majesty.
That's quite all right, thank you.
Empty teacup at 4 o'clock!
Uh, I see it, honey bun!
Oh, um... thank you.
Not at all, Your Highness.
Thank you again.
Oh, but of course, Your Majesty.
Gotcha!
And what about you, dear? Fluttershy, is it?
Me? Oh yes, Your Highness.
I understand from Twilight Sparkle's letters...
...that you enjoy tending
to the needs of woodland creatures.
Yes, I love to take care of animals.
As do I. As Princess, I care deeply
about all creatures, great and small.
Nothing means more to me
than the well-being of all my subjects.
Ah, Philomena, my pet. You're awake.
Do say hello to our gracious hosts.
Oh... my.
She is quite a sight, isn't she?
I... I... I've never seen anything like it.
Really? Well, if I must...
I'm sorry, everypony.
I'm afraid I have to cut the party short.
The mayor has requested an audience with me.
Royal duty calls. Thank you for a wonderful time.
It's been a joy getting to know you all better.
Now I can eat someth'n! I'm starved!
Stay right where you are.
All I want is a clear path to the exit.
NOBODY MOVE and my dress won't get hurt!
Stay back! Back, I say!
Well, Spike...
I don't know for sure
how things went with the Princess...
...but at least no big disasters happened.
Oh, you poor little thing.
How did you ever get in such bad condition?
Don't you worry, Philomena.
I'll nurse you back to health.
As a favor to the Princess, who's obviously
just far too busy to care for you properly.
I'm sure the Princess will appreciate the help.
Oh my. We'd better get you to bed right away.
There.
This is far worse than I thought.
What you need is some medicine. Stat!
Here you go, Philomena.
This will fix you right up.
Doctor Fluttershy expected that.
Always works.
Uh... Almost always.
There's nothing like home-made soup
to cure what ails you.
Come on now. You're not gonna get better
if you don't cooperate.
Mmm... See? It's delicious.
Good and good for you.
Here come the choo-choo train.
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo!
Oh dear.
Don't worry, Philomena.
I know what'll make you feel better.
Wait right here. I have just the thing.
Look, Philomena. I brought a fellow
feathered friend by to cheer you up.
Hummingway here was sick once too,
but he let me help him and got better in no time.
Didn't you, boy?
Say hello to your new friend Philomena.
Aw, look. I think he likes you.
Your turn now, Philomena.
Go ahead. You can do it.
Um... good try?
I know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat.
A humidifier.
Refreshing.
How's that feeling now for you,
Philomena? Better?
Oh...
That's okay.
I know lots of other ways to take care of you.
Don't worry. You're gonna get better.
How about...
Aromatherapy?
Warm bath?
Ointment?
Scalpel.
Surgical tape.
Feathers.
Oh, Philomena.
I thought it would be easy
to nurse you back to health.
I've tried everything I know.
And look at you. You're worse than ever.
Hi, Fluttershy!
I just wanted to drop by and
say thank you so very much...
...for making such a good impression
on the Princess today...
What is Celestia's pet doing here?!
I couldn't leave the poor thing there.
She needed my help.
Oh no. NonononononoNO!
This is bad.
How could I just walk away and not do anything?
But... but... she doesn't belong to you!
I had to do something.
Without telling anypony?!
Without asking permission?!
But...
I know you had good intentions...
...but you have got to return Princess's pet!
But...
You're right.
Okay, let's...
...go.
If we hurry, we can put her back
before anypony even realizes she's missing.
We were told we could find Twilight Sparkle here.
We regret to inform you, miss...
...that the royal pet has gone missing.
Really? You don't say!
It's that dry night air.
But it's daytime.
Well, day air's even drier.
You guards better be on your way
if you're gonna find the Princess's missing pet.
Philomena, was it?
Thank you ever so much for keeping me in the loop.
BYE!
What are you doing?!
Going to return Philomena, remember?
We can't now!
Why not?
You have no idea what the Princess is gonna do
if she finds you're the one who took her pet, do you?!
Do you?
Well... no.
But it can't be anything good.
She might banish you from Equestria.
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon
in the place that she banishes you to.
You really think the Princess would do that?
Okay. Granted that probably won't happen...
...but do you wanna take any chances?
All that really matters to me is that
poor little Philomena here gets well.
That's very noble of you.
I'll write to you when you're banished.
Unless I'm banished too
somewhere there's no post office.
Then you'll have to write to me. Deal?
Please, Twilight. You just have to
help me get Philomena healthy...
...and then we can return her to the Princess.
And everything will be fine.
Did you give her any kind of medicine?
I tried to, but she wouldn't take it.
Then you have to MAKE her take it.
You can't be such a pushover, Fluttershy!
You need to show this patient who's the boss.
Make her straighten up and fly right!
She can't fly.
No excuses!
Done. Okay, what else?
Uh... well, she keeps pulling her feathers off.
The ones that haven't fallen out yet
from all her coughing, I mean.
There you go.
I don't think she likes it.
Tough love, baby.
You want her to get well, don't you?
Of course, but...
NEXT!
Well, she desperately needs some bed rest...
...but I can't get her to stay put.
One step ahead of you.
It's for your own good, Philomena, I promise.
Please, just relax and try to get some sleep.
What's this soup over here? Smells delicious.
I made it for Philomena. But she wouldn't eat it.
Oh, she'll eat it, all right.
Hey! Where are you going?
No! Philomena! Come back!
What are you two doing?
Are you having a race?
Oh, can I play? 123GO!
Excuse me!
Hi!
Beg your pardon!
Put me down!
What in tarnation?!
Sorry, but we've gotta find...
The Princess's pet bird!
Philomena! Come down from there!
You'll hurt yourself!
I'll catch you!
What is going on here?
Twilight.
Yes, Your Majesty?
There's been a terrible accident.
It's all my fault.
No, Princess. Fluttershy didn't know any better.
It was my fault.
I'm the one who did it.
But you were only trying to help.
Some help I was.
Will ya let me do this? She'll go easier on me.
But it's my fault!
No, it's my fault!
No! It's my fault!
Wait. What are we talking about?
Thanks for trying to protect me, Twilight, but...
Princess Celestia, I'm the one who took your pet bird.
I really was only trying to help the poor little thing.
Then I was gonna bring it back to you, honest.
So, if you wanna banish me and then throw me
in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to...
...then that's what I deserve.
Oh, stop fooling around, Philomena.
You're scaring everypony.
I don't understand!
What is that thing? What happened to Philomena?
This is Philomena.
She's quite a sight, as I said.
But nothing unusual for a phoenix.
Isn't that right, Philomena?
A... A phoenix?
A phoenix is a majestic and magical bird.
While it appears healthy and happy
most of the time...
...every so often it must renew itself by shedding
all of its feathers and bursting into flame.
Rather melodramatic, if you ask me.
It then rises from the ashes, fresh as a daisy.
All just a normal part of the life cycle of a phoenix.
I'm afraid, mischievous little Philomena here...
...took the occasion to have
a little fun with you, Fluttershy.
Say you're sorry, young lady.
So... aren't you gonna banish me?
Or throw me in a dungeon?
Or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon
in the place that you banish me to?
Of course not, my little pony.
Where on Earth would you get such an idea?
I guess I have some imagination.
Fluttershy really did do everything she could
to try to take care of Philomena for you.
And I do appreciate that your heart
was in the right place, child.
But all you had to do was ask me and
I could have told you Philomena was a phoenix...
...and saved you all this trouble.
I know. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions.
Next time I'll ask before
taking matters into my own hooves.
Should I write you a letter
about that lesson, Princess?
No, that's quite all right.
I think I can remember.
It's beautiful.
Thank you, Philomena.
No hard feelings.
Yes!
Oh, Opalescence. Can you just picture it?
Moi, stepping up in astounding new gown
at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!
Why, yes! I did make it myself.
Thank you so much for asking.
Oh, Opal, of course you can help me. Thank you.
What's that? You wanna help me more!
Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?
Careful now. Don't move.
This shouldn't take long at all.
Howdy, Rarity?
Shh... Can't you see Rarity
is trying to concentrate?
What do you think she's makin'?
Looks like a dress.
Well, that makes sense.
Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all.
Is there something I can help you with?
Oh, so very sorry to trouble you,
Rarity, but I need a quick favor.
Could you please fix the button for me?
It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala.
Oh, no, no, no! You can't wear this... old thing.
You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala.
And I'll make it for you. No problem at all.
It will be my pleasure!
Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer,
Rarity, but I can't let you do that.
It would be so much work. This dress is fine.
Twilight Sparkle.
I insist on making you a new dress.
But...
No no, not a word!
I won't take no for an answer.
Well, in that case... Thank you
for your generosity, Rarity.
Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure
it will be absolutely beautiful.
Let me guess, Applejack.
You don't want a new gown either.
Gown? Shoot. I was just gonna
wear my old work duds.
You can't possibly be serious, Applejack!
You absolutely must wear formal attire.
Nah.
What if I just spruce up your...
duds for you a little bit?
Okay, sure. Why not?
Since you're up for it and all.
Just don't make them too... froufrou-y.
Deal!
Look out below!
Sorry. New trick. Didn't quite work.
Idea!
I'll make you an outfit for
the Gala too, Rainbow Dash.
Outfit for the what now?
I'll make one for you and you and all of you.
Oh! And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too.
Oh, and when I'm done, we can
hold our very own fashion show!
What a great idea!
If you're sure you can handle it.
Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it
will be a wonderful boost for my business.
Plus, fun!
Oh, I love fun things!
Then it's settled.
We'll have a fashion show starring us.
So all you have to do is make a
different, stunning, original...
...amazing outfit for one, two, three, four,
five... plus yourself, six ponies?
And lickety split?
Oh, Applejack.
You make it sound as if it's going to be hard.
Thread by thread, stitching it together
Twilight's dress
Cutting out the pattern snip by snip
Making sure the fabric folds nicely
It's the perfect color and so hip
Always gotta keep in mind my pacing
Making sure the cloth's correctly facing
I'm stitching Twilight's dress
Yard by yard, fussing on the details
Jewel neckline
Don't you know a stitch in time saves nine?
Make her something perfect to inspire
Even though she hates formal attire
Gotta mind those intimate details
Even though she's more concerned with sales
It's Applejack's new dress
Dressmaking's easy
For Pinkie Pie something pink
Fluttershy something breezy
Blend color and form...
Do you think it looks cheesy?
Something brash, perhaps quite fetching
Hook and eye
Couldn't you just simply die?
Making sure it fits forelock and crest
Don't forget some magic in the dress
Even though it rides high on the flank
Rainbow won't look like a tank
I'm stitching Rainbow's dress
Piece by piece, snip by snip
Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip
Thread by thread, primmed and pressed
Yard by yard, never stressed
And that's the Art of the Dress!
That's it. Keep them closed.
Don't look.
Okay, you can look now!
These are your new outfits.
What do you think of your old duds now,
Applejack? Pretty swanky, are they not?
And Twilight! I made this dress for you...
...and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly
reflect each pony's unique personality.
Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right
on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it.
Oh, and it turned out
BEAUTIFUL, don't you think?
Ooo, and I know you are going to love
yours, Fluttershy. It just sings spring!
And Pinkie Pie, look! Pink! Your favorite!
Aren't they all amazing?
Wow...
They're...
Yeah, they're...
They sure are...
...sumth'n.
Yes! Something.
I love something! Something is my favorite!
It's... nice.
But what's the matter? Don't you like them?
They're very nice...
And we're plum grateful cause
you worked so hard on them.
Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining.
She asked.
I guess what we're all saying is that
they're just not what we had in mind.
That's okay. Not a problem.
There's plenty more where that came from.
They were only a first pass.
You're my friends and I want
you to be 110% satisfied.
Not to worry, I'll redo them.
Oh, Rarity. You don't have to do that.
They're fine.
I want them to be better that just fine.
I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.
Are you sure?
I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose.
Oh, it's no ???. Really, I insist.
Well, in that case... Thank you again, Rarity.
What have I gotten myself into?
Hello?
You wanted to see me, Rarity?
Fluttershy! Your new-new gown's ready.
I completely revised it and
I know you're going to love it.
What do you think?
I...
...love it.
Oh, you're just saying that.
No, no. I do.
It's... nice.
"Nice"?
Nice.
If you don't like it, you should just tell me.
Oh, but I do like it.
Like it or love it?
Um... both?
Which is it?
Please stop asking me this, I...
Well, just tell me what you really think.
No, that's okay...
Tell me.
No... it's fine...
Tell me!
I... like it...
Tell me, tell me, tellmetellmetellme!
All right! Since you really wanna know...
The arm's sized tight, the middy collar
doesn't go with the shawl lapel...
...the hems are clearly machine-stitched,
the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile...
...you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a
topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch...
...and the overdesign is reminiscent of
prêt-à-porter and not true French haute couture.
But, uh... you know...
um, whatever you want to do is fine.
Now, the stars on my belt need
to be technically accurate.
Orion has three stars on his belt, not four.
Stitch by stitch, stitching it together
Deadline looms
Don't know the client's always right?
Even if my fabric choice was perfect
Got to get them all done by tonight
Pinkie Pie, the color's too obtrusive
Wait until you see it in the light
I'm sewing them together!
Don't you think my gown would be
more "me" with some lollipops?
Well, I think...
Balloons?
Well...
DO EET!
Hour by hour, one more change
I'm sewing them together, take great pains
Fluttershy, you're putting me in a bind
Rainbow Dash, what is on your mind?
Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time
Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine
Dressmaking's easy
Every customer's call
Brings a whole new revision
Have to pick up the pace
Still hold to my vision
That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor.
French haute couture, please.
What if it rains? Galoshes!
More balloons! Oh no, that's too many balloons.
More candy! Oh, less candy.
Oh wait, I know. Streamers!
Streamers?
Whose dress is this?
Streamers it is.
What?
Aren't you going to tell me
to change something too?
No, I just want my dress to be cool.
Do you not like the color?
The color's fine, just make it look cooler.
Do you not like the shape?
The shape's fine, just make
the whole thing... you know, cooler.
It needs to be about 20% cooler.
All we ever want is indecision
All we really like is what we know
Gotta balance style with adherence
Making sure we make a good appearance
Even if you simply have to fudge it
Make sure that it stays within our budget
Got to overcome intimidation
Remember, it's all in the presentation!
Piece by piece, snip by snip
Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip
Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed
Yard by yard, always stressed
And that's the Art of the Dress!
Oh, Opal. These are the ugliest
dresses I've ever made.
Okay. I did exactly what each of you asked for.
Now don't hold back.
Let me know what you really think.
Oh my!
It's... perfect!
It's cool!
Wow. They're the best duds I ever did see.
It's exactly what I asked for!
Thank you, Rarity.
Are you as happy with the as we're?
Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy.
I'm just relieved to finally be done.
You are never gonna believe this!
You've heard of Hoity-Toity?
The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?
Uh-huh. He heard about your fashion show.
Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him...
He's coming here all the way from
Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!
Whoa, Nelly!
You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy.
You business will be boomin'!
Hoity-Toity?
He's coming here?
To see THESE dresses?
Yep! Get ready for all
of your dreams to come true.
There he is!
Okay. Relax, Rarity.
Your friends like their outfits and so will he.
What's wrong with the lights?!
Oh, yes. That means the show's starting. Good.
Since the beginning of time the elite
of Equestria have longed for pony fashions...
...that that truly expressed the
essence of their very souls.
Patiently waiting decades... no, centuries!
...for the perfect pony gown.
Today at long last, Equestria, your wait is over!
Let's hear it for the breathtaking
designs of Ponyville's own...
Rarity!
Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?
Oh dear.
You think we overdid it?
Nah.
Okay, maybe a little.
Those amateurish designs look like a piled-on
mishmash of everything but a kitchen sink!
It's a travesty, it's what it is.
Those outfits are the ugliest things
I've ever seen, oh for shame.
Who is responsible for subjecting
our eyes to these horrors?
Not to mention wasting my valuable time.
Hide me.
Come on out and take a bow, Rarity.
You worked really hard for this.
Yes! Alright, woohoo! Go, Rarity!
Rarity? You okay in there?
You haven't come out for days.
I'm never coming out! I can't
show my face in Ponyville ever again!
I used to be somepony. I used to be respected.
I made dresses. Beautiful, beautiful dresses!
But now everypony is laughing at me.
I'm nothing but a laughingstock!
You're not a laughingstock, Rarity...
She kind of is.
Shhh!
Come on out and talk to us.
Leave me alone!
I vant to be alone! I want to wallow in...
...whatever it is that ponies
are supposed to wallow in!
Do ponies wallow in pity?
Oh, listen to me, I don't even know
what I'm supposed to wallow in!
I'M SO PATHETIC!
Now what do we do?
Panic?
That's your answer for everything!
Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this.
She'll become a crazy cat lady!
She only has one cat.
Give her time.
Exile...
I guess technically I'd have to
move away to live in exile.
Where would I go? And what would I pack?
Oh, it's going to take me forever
to do all of that packing.
What are you supposed to pack
when you go to exile?
Are you supposed to pack warm?
Opal?
Opal, how did you get up there?
Hang on, you poor dear! Mama's coming!
Rainbow Dash?!
How dare you strand my poor Opal on the tree.
Well, how else were we gonna get
you out here to show you...
...this!
What is it? It's not... You...
We all finished your dress for you.
Thanks to Fluttershy's
freaky knowledge of sewing.
Do you like it?
Like it?
Like it?!
Uh-uh. She doesn't like it.
No, I don't like it.
I LOVE IT!
You ponies did an amazing job.
It's exactly the way I imagined it.
We just followed your brilliant design.
Like we should have let you do for our outfits.
Those first dressed you designed were perfect.
We're so super sorry.
You worked really hard to make our
dresses exactly the way we wanted them.
We all saw how well that turned out.
Oh, I forgive you.
Well, that's mighty big of you.
But my whole career is still ruined!
Oh, right. That.
Maybe not.
All right, I haven't got all day.
Take two.
Hello...
Oh, this can't be the same designer.
Simply magnificent!
And suddenly I have a fresh craving
for some Dutch apple pie...
Candied apples on a stick?
Apple turnovers? Apple cobbler?
Brilliant!
Oh, spectacular!
Now this is a fashion show.
All of these dresses are absolutely amazing.
Who is responsible?
Step forward, show yourself!
Bravo! Bravo!
Magnifico! Oh boy!
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Oh, thank you so much!
"Dear Princess Celestia."
"This week my very talented
friend Rarity learned..."
"...that if you try to please everypony,
you often times end up pleasing nopony."
"Especially yourself."
"
"When somepony offers to do you a favor..."
"...like making you a beautiful dress..."
"...you shouldn't be overly critical
of something generously given to you."
"In other words, you shouldn't
look a gift horse in the mouth."
Rarity, my congratulations.
You are the most impressive fashion maven.
Would you do me the great honor
of allowing me to feature your couture...
...in my best of the best boutique in Canterlot?
Now, I'll need you to make a dozen
of each dress for me by next Tuesday.
Hoowee! Not a bad pitch for a pony who
works with her head in the clouds.
Oh yeah? Think you can do better, cowgirl?
I know I can.
Oh, for Pete's sake!
Heh! Looks like this pegasus can
pitch better than the workhorse.
The object of the game is to
get the closest to the stake.
Alright, alright.
You got another throw there, pony girl.
Wow, Rainbow! Heh. You couldn't hit the
barn door with that kind of a throw.
Yeah, yeah. I still have the closest
throw, Applesmack. Just try and beat it.
Yeehaw! It's a ringer.
That's how you do it down here on the farm.
I lost.
Oh, don't feel bad, Rainbow.
It's all in good fun.
I hate losing.
Besides, you're a mighty good athlete.
I'm just better, heh heh heh...
Alright, Applejack! You think you're
the top athlete in all of Ponyville?
Well, I was gonna say in all of Equestria,
but that might be gilding the lily.
And I think I'm the top athlete. So let's prove it!
Prove what?
I challenge you to an Iron Pony competition.
A series of athletic contests to decide
who's the best once and for all!
You know what, Rainbow? You're on!
So you two are doing what now?
An Iron...
Iron Pony competition.
See, we've set up a bunch of events
to decide which one of us is...
The most athletic pony ever!
And I'm here too...
Uh... I don' know! Why is she here?
To be our judge and keep score.
Right, heh! Somepony's gotta record
my awesomeness for the history books.
Hello everypony and welcome to
the first annual Iron Pony competition!
Uh... Spike? Who are you talking to?
Um... Them!
Let the games begin!
Ready, set, go!
Dagnabit!
Time, Spike?
17 seconds.
You're kiddin'. That breaks my
record from last year's rodeo.
But you got a five second
penalty for nudging the barrel.
Nuts n' screws!
Still, that's 22 seconds. Not too shabby.
Hey, don't be nervous.
Remember, it's all in good fun.
Now git on up there!
Ready, set, go!
Whoo! That was some fancy
hoofwork there, Rainbow!
Thanks! But I couldn't have been as fast as you.
What was the time on that, Spike?
18 seconds!
18 seconds?!
Rainbow, are you sure you're
not secretly a rodeo pony?
Rainbow Dash wins the Barrel Lead!
I can't believe I won!
Yeah, well, don't you go gettin' used to it!
Mighty respectable, but let me
show you how it's really done.
Years of applebuckin'.
Why me?
Go!
Ready for another pony ride?
No...
Go!
Rainbow Dash wins the Bronco Buck!
And I lose...
How I get roped into these things...
Does this count?
Fillies and gentlecolts!
At the halfway point our
competitors are tied at 5 and 5!
Who are you talking to?
Them!
95...
96...
97...
98...
99...
A hundred!
Yes!
Be a good sport, Applejack.
All right, you two. This is the final event.
Give it all you've got!
Looks like the workhorse might
come out ahead in this one.
[That's not fair! You can't use
your wings to help you win!]
[You're cheatin'!]
[I can't understand you with
that rope in your mouth.]
I SAID...! Uh-oh.
I win by a landslide!
Or mudslide in your case.
I am the Iron Pony!
Only 'cos you cheated!
What?
You used your wingpower to help
you win over half those contests!
Sounds like sour apples to me.
Are you sayin' you didn't use your wings?
Well... no. But you never said
I couldn't use my wings.
I didn't think I needed to tell you to play fair.
I still would have won even without my wings.
Hah! Prove it.
Gladly. How?
Tomorrow's the annual Runnin' of the Leaves.
I challenge you to race me in it!
Heh! Easy shmeasy.
Hold on!
the point is to *run*.
So no wings allowed!
No wings?
No problem!
Twilight, hurry up!
We're gonna be late for the race.
Why are you so excited about the race?
It's only for ponies.
Yeah, but I'm hoping I can
be the announcer again.
Fillies and gentlecolts...
Welcome to the annual Running of the Leaves!
This is Pinkie Pie, your official
eye-in-the-sky announcer.
Sorry, Spike. I guess that job's already taken.
As everypony know, the Running
is very important tradition...
...for without it, the autumn leaves
of Equestria would never fall.
So get ready, pony. The Running of
the Leaves will begin in 5 minutes.
Pardon me! Excuse me!
Make way for the Iron Pony!
The Iron Phony, you mean.
So, Applejack. You ready to win second place?
I'm ready to run a good, clean race!
Yeah, yeah...
You are not allowed to use your wings!
I could win this race with both
wings tied behind my back.
Trussed up like a turkey.
Well, a turkey who can't fly, that is.
Very funny.
'least now we know we're racin' fair and square.
Racers! Please take your position.
Um... Pinkie Pie?
Hey, Spike! What's up?
Oh wait, it me! I'm up!
Uh, yeah, uh... I know you're doing
the announcing today and stuff and...
I'm sure you're gonna do a great job
and all, but... I was just wondering...
What?
Uh... Forget it!
Spike!
Would you like to be my co-reporter?
We could comment on the action together!
We could?
Climb on up!
Twilight? What in tarnation
are you doin' up here?
I'm racing!
Good one, Twilight!
I'm not joking.
What?!
You're not an athlete, you're a...
well... you're an egghead.
I am not an egghead! I am well read.
Egghead.
But ha... have you ever run a race?
Well, no. But I do know a lot about running.
And you know this from...
Books. I've read several on the subject.
What'd you read?
The "Egghead's Guide to Running"?
Di... di... did you stretch out
your eye muscles to warm up?
HA HA HA HA!
Get it? Eye muscles!
Scoff if you must, Rainbow. But the Running
of the leaves is a Ponyville tradition.
And since I'm here to learn, I've
decided I should experience it myself.
Well, I think that's just
dandy, Twilight. Good luck!
Yeah! See you at the finish line!
Tomorrow.
All right, ponies! Are you ready?
Get set!
And they're off!
Welcome to the official coverage
of the Running of the Leaves.
You know, Spike, despite its name, the
leaves don't do any of the actual running.
No, that's left to My Little Ponies.
Why... Yes, Pinkie. It's the running of the
ponies that causes the leaves to fall.
Ugh... Those lazy, lazy leaves.
But his year, the run is
about more than the weather.
It's about the race to the finish
and the two runners want to win it.
Applejack and Rainbow Dash.
You know, Pinkie, these two ponies have a bit
of a grudge match they're trying to settle.
Trying to prove who's the most athletic.
Yes and "grudge" rhymes with "fudge".
Yes, it... does. What?
And I like fudge. But if I eat too much
fudge, I get a pudge and then I can't budge.
So... no fudge?
Oh, no thanks. I had a big breakfast.
Let's check in with our two competitive
Applejack and Rainbow Dash.
Having come fast out of the gate, Applejack
and Rainbow Dash are evenly matched...
...running neck and neck.
But what's this? Applejack is making
the move, she's now ahead by a nose.
But Rainbow Dash pulls Applejack up and
takes the lead. She's ahead by half a nose.
Or maybe three quarters of a nose.
No, about 63.7% of a nose...
Roughly speaking.
Applejack sees this move and pushes
forth with her strong workhorse legs...
...slinking ahead by 350 noses!
Not so easy without wings, is it?
Come on, Rainbow. Show 'em a little dash!
Ho-hold your horses, Pinkie! Rainbow Dash
is catching up the frontrunner Applejack.
What an upset! I thought
Applejack had this in the bag.
You didn't think I was gonna let
you off that easy, did you?
I don't believe it!
I know, it's beautiful, isn't it?
Not the scenery, Twilight.
Rainbow Dash just tripped me.
She did not.
She did too!
She did not!
And if you slowed down and looked
where you're going, like me...
...you'd see that you tripped over a rock.
What? Oh, hayseed!
Now I got a lot of ground to
make up to catch Rainbow.
Just be careful!
See you at the finish line!
I don't believe it!
After a huge setback, Applejack is
back at the front of the pack.
She's the head of the pack, all right.
The pick of the litter! The CAT'S PYJAMAS!
Oh, wait! Why would Applejack take some poor
kitty's PJs? That's not very sporting of her.
Oookay... Let's get back to the race.
Not so fast, Applejack! This race isn't over yet.
It is for you.
I don't believe it! Applejack tripped me.
Don't you ponies ever look where you're going?
You tripped on a stump. See?
Oh, I see. A big cheater is what I see.
Rainbow, Applejack would never cheat.
It was just an accident.
Sure it was.
I mean... Yeah! I'm sure it was.
Remember, Rainbow, this is just a game.
Yes. But the rules have changed.
And two can play at that game.
Welcome back, Ponyvillians! It's me, Pinkie Pie.
And Spike.
Looks like Rainbow's doing her best to catch up.
I'm not sure how ketchup is
going to help her in this contest.
Now, in a hot dog eating contest it
can make them doggies nice and slippery.
But personally, I prefer mustard.
How about you, Spike?
Uh... I like... pickles?
Aaand it looks like Applejack has found herself
in quite a pickle as Rainbow overtakes her.
Look, ma! No wings!
As the racers enter Equestria's Whitetail
Wood, Rainbow Dash is back in the lead.
Hey! Rainbow!
Why, that little cheater did that on purpose!
It's on!
Nice one, Rainbow.
...Later!...
Oh my! Whitetail Wood is just lovely.
Hey, Rainbow! Shouldn't you be up ahead?
I'm sure I'll win now.
Except that all the other racers just passed you.
Oh horse apples...! See ya!
Applejack! What are you doing up here?
There aren't even any trees.
Uh, no, but the sign's pointed this way...
Rainbow!
Mind giving me a lift?
What a hay?! You said no flying!
No. I said no wings.
I must say, Spike, that this has been...
...the most interesting Running
of the Leaves in Equestria history!
With the most interesting announcing...
But it isn't the running that's been fascinating.
It's the lack of running!
Forgive me, girls. I know I'm not an athlete...
...but shouldn't the Running of
the Leaves actually involve running?
You know, I think Twilight's right.
You do?
Yeah! If you wanna beat me, you better...
RUUUN!
Once again, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are
neck and neck, jockeying for position.
Applejack inches ahead, now it's Rainbow...
...it's Applejack, it's
Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack!
Oh no, she di'int!
Oh yes, she di'id!
Cut it out!
No, you cut it out!
You started it!
And now I'm gonna finish it.
Oh no, you won't!
Oh yes, I will!
That's it! All bets are off.
Oh no, you don't!
It's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash,
it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash!
I won!
No! I won!
I won!
You tied!
Tied?!
For first?
For last!
LAST?!
Then who won?
YOU?!
Oh, no. But I did get fifth place.
Which is rather good, considering
I've never run a race before.
What?! How's that even possible?
You ran so slow. And looked at the scenery.
Exactly! I paced myself, just like my book said.
Then at the end, when all
the other ponies were worn out...
...I sprinted to the finish.
I don't believe it. Twilight beat us!
Well, with all your horsing
around, it was quite easy.
You're right, Twilight.
Our behavior was just terrible.
We weren't very good sports.
Sounds to me like an important
lesson was learned.
PRINCESS CELESTIA?!
Wh... What are you doin' here?
Fall is one of my favorite seasons.
So I came to celebrate
the Running of the Leaves.
I'm sorry you had to see us being
such poor sport, Princess.
That's all right, Applejack.
Anypony can get swept up in the
excitement of competition.
It's important to remember that the friendship
is always more important than the competition.
Exactly, Twilight.
Now, unfortunately, because the two
of you were busy tricking each other...
...instead of shaking down leaves, many of
the lovely trees in Equestria are still covered.
Why, Princess, I bet we can knock those
leaves down for you lickety split.
Whaddya say, friend?
Wanna go for another run?
I'd love to stretch my legs!
Boy howdy! I got my work cut out for me.
That there's the biggest bumper crop
a' apples I've ever laid eyes on.
Yep. Too big for you to handle on your own.
Come on, big brother!
You need to rest up and get yourself better.
I haven't met an apple orchard yet,
that I can't handle.
Oops. Sorry.
I'll take a bite out of this job by day's end.
Bitin' off more than you can chew
is just what I'm afraid of.
Are you sayin' my mouth is makin'
promises my legs can't keep?
Yep.
Why of all the... This is your
sister Applejack, remember?
The loyalest of friends and
the most dependable of ponies!
But still only one pony. And one pony plus
hundreds o' apple trees just doesn't add up to...
Don't you use your fancy
mathematics to muddy the issue!
I said I can handle this harvest
and I'm gonna prove it to you.
I'm gonna get every last apple out of those
trees this Applebuck Season all by myself!
GOM Player is used by millions of
people around the world, find out why!
Well, I better get kickin'. These apples
aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees.
Hey!
Oh no!
STAMPEDE!
Heeey...! Thiiis maaakes myyy
voooice sooound siiilly!
Pinkie Pie! Are you crazy?! Run!
Everypony calm down!
There is no need to panic!
But Mayor! What ever shall we do?
Look there!
YEEHAW!
Other side, Winona!
Put 'em up, girl!
This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen!
Come on, little doggie! Herd!
Winona! Put 'em up!
Gotcha!
Attagirl!
Now what was that all about?
Oh my! Begging your pardon, Applejack.
But Mooriella here saw one of those nasty snakes.
And it just gave us all
the willies, don't you know?
I completely understand. Just next time,
try and steer clear o' Ponyville.
We certainly will, Applejack. So long, Winona!
Ride 'em, cowpony!
Applejack was just... just...
Appletastic!
Exactly! We must do something to thank
Applejack for single-hoofedly saving the town.
I know!
A party!
We all ready?
Just one last thing.
Now we're ready.
Is Applejack all set?
Actually, I haven't seen her all week.
Not since the stampede.
But she'll be here for sure.
Applejack is never late!
Welcome, everypony!
Today we are here to honor...
...a pony we can always count on
to help in matters great and small.
A pony, whose contributions to...
Did you see Applejack's slick moves out there?!
What an athlete!
This week she's gonna help
me with my new flying trick!
And I know it's gonna be SO AWESOME!
Exactly! And...
This week, I get to run Sugarcube
Corner for the first time!
What does that have to do with Applejack?
Oh! Applejack, one of the best
bakers ever, is gonna help me!
Applejack makes everything great.
So free samples for everypony!
Okay, that's great. Now if I could just
make a point without being inter...
Twilight...
...rupted.
Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just
wanted to mention that Applejack...
...is also helping me this week
with the official bunny census...
...where we count up all the new baby
bunnies that were born this season.
She's gonna help gather them
using her wonderful herding skills.
Anyone else? Anyone?
No?
Well then, as I was trying to say...
ARGH! Never mind!
And so, with no further ado...
...it is my privilege to give the prized Pony of
Ponyville award to our beloved guest of honor...
...a pony of the utmost trustworthiness,
reliability and integrity...
...Ponyville's most capable and
Applejack!
...way to go, Applejack,
that was awesome! I mean...
Awkward.
I'm here! I'm here!
Sorry, I'm late. Whoah... I was just...
Did I hurt your tail...?
Miss Mayor. Thank you kindly for
this here... award thingy.
It's so bright and shinin'.
I sure do look funny here.
Oookay. Well, thank you, Applejack, for
saving us from that scary stampede.
And always being there for everypony.
Yeah. I like helpin'
the ponyfolks and... and stuff...
Yeah! Thanks!
Was it just me or did Applejack seem a little...
Tired?
Dizzy?
Messy?
Well, did you see her mane?
She seemed fine to me!
What on Earth is that pony doing?
Whoops.
Hey Applejack!
Applejack! Applejack!
APPLEJACK!
Howdy Twilight?
What is all this?
It's Applebuck Season.
Apple-what Season?
It's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time.
We gather all the apples from
the trees, so we can sell 'em.
But why are you doing it all alone?
'Cos Big Macintosh hurt himself.
What about all those relatives I've met when
I first came to Ponyville? Can't they help?
They were just here
for the Apple family reunion.
They actually live all over Equestria and
are busy harvestin' their own orchards.
So... I'm on my own.
...which means, I should really get back to work.
Ahem... hint hint? Get back to work?
Fine.
Could you step aside, Twilight?
I just did.
Applejack. You don't look so good.
Yeah... don't any o' you three worry
none, I'm just fine and dandy.
Do you want some help?
Help? No way, no how.
But there's no way you can
do it all on your own.
Is that a challenge?
Um... No?
Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it!
Now if you'll excuuuse me...
I've got apples to buck.
There you are!
I'm a might sorry, Rainbow.
I was busy applebuckin' and I guess I...
I closed my eyes for a second and...
...when I woke up, I was late.
Now, what's this new trick of yours?
See this contraption?
Uh.. Yeah?
Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then
you're gonna jump down from that platform...
...launching me into the air faster than I could
take off on my own. Once I'm in the air...
...I'm gonna do some AMAZING flips and spins
that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts.
Isn't that a mite dangerous?
Not for a pony who can fly!
Well, alrighty then!
Oh my!
Ready? One... two... THREE!
Um... maybe I wasn't clear.
You're supposed to land *on* the other end.
Got it!
Applejack, what a hay is going on?
I mean, I though I was working
with Ponyville's best athlete!
You are!
I'm okay! Really! I have an idea!
Watch this!
Ta-da!
Oh... Maybe not.
Okay, one more try!
I'm sure to get it this time.
Here I go!
Wait, Applejaaaaack...!
You're welcome!
Can I help you?
I think somepony else needs your help.
Applejack?
Yep.
Applejack, can we talk?
Applejack, can we talk?
CAN BEES SQUAWK?! I DON'T THINK SO!
No! Can we talk?
TWENTY STALKS?! BEAN OR CELERY?!
No! I need to talk to you!
YOU NEED TO WALK TO THE ZOO?!
WELL, WHO'S STOPPIN' YOU?!
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU!
OH! WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?!
WHAT'S YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT?!
RAINBOW DASH DROPPED
IN TO SEE ME TODAY!
THAT'S QUITE NEIGHBORLY OF HER!
YES, EXCEPT THAT SHE
CRASHED ONTO MY BALCONY...
...AFTER YOU LAUNCHED
HER INTO THE AIR!
Oh, yeah. I wasn't feelin'
quite myself this morning.
Because you're working too
hard and you need help!
WHAT?! KELP?!
I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed!
HELP!!! YOU NEED HELP!!!
Nothin' doin', Twilight. I'm gonna prove to you...
to everypony, that I can do this on my own!
Ow!
Now if you'll excuuuse me, I've
gotta go help Pinkie Pie!
Now, Pinkie Pie, are you sure you're up for baking
the muffins and running the store this afternoon?
Yes siree bob, Mrs. Cake!
Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help
me out. Why, she's the best baker ever!
Right, Applejack?
No, you're not the best baker ever?
What?! On, no!
I mean... Don't you fret. I can bake anything
from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye.
All right. Well, see you later, girls!
Stop with the shakin'! It's time to get bakin'!
Alrighty! I'll get the sugar and the eggs.
Can you get me some chocolate chips?
W... What was that?
Chocolate chips!
Chips... Got it!
Tater chips. All salty and dry.
Okie dokie.
What next?
Baking soda!
Soda... Perfect! That'll get
the tater chips nice and wet.
Now what?
A cup of flour!
A cup o' sour? Well, lemons are sure sour.
A cup o' sour, comin' up.
Anything else, Pinkie?
One last thing. Wheat germ!
Wheat worms...? Oh! That must be
fancy talk for earthworms!
Now that's gonna be delicious!
If you say so...
Free Muffin Sample Spectacular!
Yeah! Muffin spectacles!
Get 'em while they're hot!
We came as soon as we heard!
Oh, thank you, Twilight.
We need all the help we can get.
Oh no! What happened?
It was a mishap with some of the baked goods.
No... Not baked goods... Baked bads...!
Applejack!
Want one?
Applejack? We need to talk.
Oh. It's you, Twilight.
I know what you're gonna say,
but the answer is still no.
Not to upset your applecart, but you need help.
Hardy har... No, I don't!
Here. Let me help.
Help?! No thanks!
A little more... Little...
There.
I'll prove that this apple
can handle these apples.
Come on... apples... Fall off!
AJ... I think you're beating a dead...
...tree.
I knew that.
Actually, Applejack, I had something
else to talk to you about.
I just came back from
Ponyville urgent care and...
You know? I'm a little busy to
get lectured right now, Twilight.
But if you'd just let me help...
No no NO!
How many times do I gotta say it?
I don't need no help from nopony!
That pony is stubborn as a mule!
No offense...
None taken.
Oh Applejack! Thank you so much for offering your
herding skills for the annual rabbit round up.
Why are we doing this?
Well, lots of new baby
bunnies have been born...
...so it's my job to get a count
of all the new families.
Fine. Can we just get on with it?
Certainly. But remember, these are
bunnies we're dealing with, not cows.
They are timid bunch and
need to be treated gently.
I do NOT need any direction on
corrallin' critters. Right, Winona?
Okay, little bunnies! I need you
all gather here in the middle.
That's right! Let's go, bunnies.
In the center. Hop to it!
Swell. Just swell.
Put 'em up, Winona!
Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them!
We know what we're doin'.
Get along, little bunnies!
Oh no.
STAMPEDE!
The horror...! The horror...!
That was awful!
A disaster! A horrible, horrible disaster!
I don't get it.
Our gardens! Destroyed!
Every last flower devoured.
By... By... THEM!!!
Oh my! Oh... Please stop, little bunnies!
No no! Please, let's go home! Oh my goodness!
All right. Enough is enough.
Must... keep... buckin'.
Just... a few... more...
Must... finish harvestin'.
All right, Applejack. Your applebucking
hasn't just caused you problems.
It's over-propelled pegasus, practically
poisoned plenty of ponies...
...and terrorized bushels of
brand new bouncing baby bunnies.
I don't care what you say. You! Need! Help!
No, I don't. Look! I did it!
I harvested the entire Sweet
Apple Acres without your help.
How d'ya like them apples?
Um... How do *you* like *them* apples?
...plejack? Applejack!
Oh, good! You're okay.
Now, Applejack, I completely
respect the Apple family ways.
You're always there to help anypony in need.
So maybe you can put a little of your stubborn
pride aside and allow your friends to help you?
Okay, Twilight.
I am not taking "no" for an answer... what?
Yes, Twilight. Yes, please!
I could really use your help.
"Dear Princess Celestia."
"My friend Applejack is the best
friend a pony could ever have."
"And she's always there to help anypony."
"The only trouble is, when she needs
help, she finds it hard to accept it."
"So while friendship is about
giving of ourselves to friends..."
"...it's also about accepting
what our friends have to offer."
"Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."
How about y'all take a little break?
I got some fine apple juice waitin' for ya!
Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help.
I was acting... a bit stubborn.
A bit?
Okay. A might stubborn!
And I'm awful sorry.
Now, I know the town gave
me the Prized Pony award...
...but the real award is
havin' you five as my friends.
Phew! That applebucking
sure made me hungry!
And I've got the perfect treat!
Eeeew... Spike, I threw them all away!
Where'd you get them?
From the trash!
Just a little nibble? Come on.
Are you sure about this, Scootaloo?
I've never even heard
of a pony zip lining before.
Neither have I, but Spike told me it was awesome!
See anything?
Tree sap and pine needles, but no cutie mark.
Plan B?
Yeah. You know where we can find
a cannon at this hour?
It's no use!
No matter what we try, we always
end up without our cutie marks.
And surprisingly often covered in tree sap.
Maybe we should do something less dangerous.
Like pillow testing.
Or flower sniffing.
This town is full of ponies,
who have their cutie marks.
Why don't we ask them how they did it?
That's a great *safe* idea.
Yeah! And we can start with
the coolest pony in Ponyville.
Applejack!
Rarity!
Come on, guys, I said "cool"!
You know who I'm talking about.
She's fast. She's tough.
She's not afraid of anything!
Pinkie Pie?
No! The greatest flyer ever
to come out of Cloudsdale.
Fluttershy?
No! Rainbow Dash!
Oh! Yeah, that makes much more sense.
Of course!
Let's do it. Let's find how
Rainbow Dash earned her cutie mark!
YEAH!
Get back here, you thievin' vermins!
Thievin' what now?
Apple Bloom?
Hey sis! How'd you get your cutie mark?
I never told you that story?
Hey! I thought we were gonna ask Rainbow Dash.
We need all the help we can get.
Fine.
Why, shoot.
I was just a little filly.
Even littler than y'all.
I didn't want to spend my life
at a muddy old apple farm.
I wanted to live the sophisticated life.
Like my Aunt n' Uncle Orange.
So I set out to try my luck in a big city.
Manehattan!
The most cosmopolitan city in all of Equestria.
Ey! Outta the way, you ???!
I knew I'd find out who I was
meant to be in Manehattan.
Aunt Orange! Uncle Orange!
Thank y'all so much for lettin' me stay!
"Y'all". Ahahaha...
Isn't she just the living end?
How quaint.
Don't worry. We'll have you acting
like a true Manehattanite in no time.
And how are you finding good old Manehattan?
Oh, it's simply divine.
Very well said, my dear.
Although, I must admit the city noise
took some getting used to.
Where I'm from, nights are so quiet...
...you seldom hear a peep
until the roosters wake you.
The... what?
what in the world is a "rooster"?
What's he talking about?
What do I say?
I don't wanna look like a fool.
Dinner is served.
Thank goodness. Being a city pony's hard work.
I'm so hungry I could eat a...
Cock-a-doodle-doo...
Oh, I wonder what Granny Smith
and Big Macintosh are up to.
I bet they're applebuckin' their way
through the Red Delicious trees.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just one bite...
I never felt so homesick in all my days
as I did right then.
It was amazin'!
A rainbow pointin' right back to... home.
In that moment, it all became clear.
I knew right then just who I was supposed to be.
That's when this here appeared.
I've been happily workin' in the farm ever since.
There they are!
Get back here, ya thievin' vermins!
That was such a sweet story!
Sweet? Try sappy.
Come on! We've got to find Rainbow Dash
and hear the cool way to get a cutie mark.
All right, little ones. This way. This way.
You really should be more careful.
Somepony could get hurt.
Why you in such a hurry anyway?
We're trying to find Rainbow Dash, so we
can hear how she earned her cutie mark.
Oh, that would be interesting.
You know, I wouldn't have gotten
my cutie mark if it weren't for her.
Rainbow Dash?! Really?!
Oh yes. It all started at Summer Flight Camp.
You'd never guess, but when
I was little I was very shy.
And a very weak flyer.
Nice going, "Cluttershy"!
They'll ground you permanently.
HA! My baby brother can fly better than you!
It was the most humiliating moment of my life.
And then, out of nowhere...
Leave her alone!
Ooh, what are you gonna do, "Rainbow Crash"?
Keep making fun of her and we'll find out!
You think you're such a big shot?
Why don't you prove it?
Whaddya have in mind?
You're going down!
In history, maybe.
See you boys at the finish line!
I've never seen such beautiful creatures.
Butterflies don't fly as high as my cloud home.
And I've never been near the ground before.
What is this place
Filled with so many wonders
Casting its spell
That I am now under
Squirrels in the trees
And the cute little bunnies
Birds flying free
And bees with their honey
Honeeey!
Oh, what a magical place
And I owe it all to the pegasus race
If I knew the ground had so much up its sleeve
I'd have come here sooner and never leave!
Yes, I love everything!
Shhh...
It's okay.
You can come out.
Everything's okay.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Somehow I had the ability to communicate
with the animals on a different level.
Wait, wait, wait. What happened to Rainbow Dash?
What about the race?
Oh. Well, I wasn't there so
I don't really know what happened.
Come one, Crusaders. We've gotta find her.
Besides, I can't take any more singing.
Maybe my sister knows where she is?
Bye, Fluttershy!
Bye, girls!
How do we get roped into this?
Oh, we'll never hear Rainbow Dash's story.
Are you girls still obsessing
over your cutie marks?
Of course! Most other fillies
at school already have theirs.
Mmm, I know how you feel.
For the longest time I couldn't
figure out why I didn't have mine.
Well done, Rarity. Your costumes are very nice.
Nice? They need to be spectacular!
And the performance is tomorrow!
I tried every trick I could think of,
but nothing seemed to work.
The costumes just weren't right.
And the play opened that night!
Maybe I'm not meant to be
a fashionista after all.
What's going on?!
I had no idea where my horn was taking me.
But unicorn magic doesn't
happen without a reason.
I knew this had to do with my love of fashion...
...and maybe even my cutie mark!
I knew that this was...
MY DESTINY!
A ROCK?!
That's my destiny?!
What is your problem, horn?
I followed you all the way out here for a rock?!
Dumb rock!
Ugh!
These namby-pamby stories aren't getting us
any closer to our cutie marks!
They're all about finding who you really are
and boring stuff like that.
Yes, Scootaloo, that's exactly...
Come on, girls! We need action!
We need Rainbow Dash!
As a young filly in Canterlot, I always
wanted to go to the Summer Sun Celebration...
...where Princess Celestia raises the sun.
And I saw the most amazing,
most wonderful thing I've ever seen.
I poured myself into learning
everything I could about magic.
My parents decided to enroll me in
Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns.
It was a dream come true!
Except for one thing...
I had to pass an entrance exam!
Well, Miss Sparkle?
Well, Miss Sparkle?
We don't have all day.
I knew this was the most
important day of my life...
...that my entire future would be affected
by the outcome of this day...
...and I was about to blow it!
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Twilight Sparkle.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean...
You have a very special gift.
I don't think I've ever come across
a unicorn with your raw abilities.
Huh?
But you need to learn to tame
these abilities through focus study.
Huh?!
Twilight Sparkle, I'd like to make you
my own personal protege here at the school.
HUH?!
Well?
YES!!!
One other thing, Twilight.
More?
My cutie mark!
Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes
yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes...
Okay, okay.
We're happy for you, Twilight.
Yeah, thrilled. Let's get out of here
while we still can.
...yesyes, YEEEES!
Are you okay?
Um... yes.
Aaargh, why don't ever smash into Rainbow Dash?!
You're looking for Rainbow Dash?
If I was her, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner.
Of course, if I was anyone,
I'd be at Sugarcube Corner.
Hey! I have an idea!
Wanna go to Sugarcube Corner?
Well, we're sort of looking for Rainbow Dash,
so we can hear how she got her cutie mark.
Cutie mark? Come with me
and I'll tell you how I got mine!
Why not?
Awright!
My sisters and I were raised
on a rock farm outside of Ponyville.
We spent our days working the fields.
There was no talking. There was no smiling.
There were only rocks.
We were in the south field, preparing to
rotate rocks to the east field.
Then all of a sudden...
I've never felt joy like that before.
It felt so good I just
wanted to keep smiling forever.
And I wanted everyone I knew to smile too...
...but rainbows don't come along that often.
I wondered, how else could I create some smiles?
We better harvest the rocks from the south field.
Pinkamena Diane Pie! Is that you?
Mom! I need you and dad
and the sisters to come in. Quick!
Surprise!
You like it? It's called...
...a party!
Oh. You don't like it.
You like it!
I'm so happy!
And that's how Equestria was made.
Wha... huh?
Look! We're here!
Maybe on the way home I can tell you
the story of how I got my cutie mark.
It's a gem!
Oh, come on. She's just being Pinkie Pie.
Rainbow Dash! You're here!
I hear *you're* looking for my cutie mark story.
You have no idea what I've been through
today to hear that story.
It all happened during the race at Flight Camp...
...where I stood alone against all odds
to defend Fluttershy's honor.
I've never flown like THAT before.
That freedom was unlike anything I've ever felt.
The speed, the adrenaline, the wind in my mane...
I liked it!
A lot.
Later, "Rainbow Crash"!
Hey!
Turns out the only thing
I liked more than flying fast...
...was winning!
Most people thought that the sonic rainboom
was just an old mare's tale.
But that day... The day I discovered racing...
...I proved that the legends were true.
I made the impossible happen!
That that, little ones,
is how you earn a cutie mark.
Wooooow...
Wait a second.
I heard that explosion.
And I saw the rainbow too.
Rainbow Dash, if you hadn't scared the animals...
...I never would have learned I could
communicate with them and gotten my cutie mark.
I heard that boom! And right afterwards there was
amazing rainbow that taught me to smile.
When I got my cutie mark...
...I saw a rainbow that pointed me home.
I bet it was your sonic rainboom!
There an explosion I could never explain,
when I got my cutie mark.
This is uncanny!
If that explosion didn't happen when it did...
...I would have blown my entrance exam.
Rainbow Dash, I think you helped me
earn my cutie mark too!
We all owe our cutie marks to you!
Do you realize what this means?
All of us had a special connection
before we even met.
We've been BFFs forever
and we didn't even know it!
Come here, y'all.
Gimme a break.
Come on, Crusaders!
Maybe we just need to try zip lining again.
Hey. How about a song?
NOOOOO!
"Dear Princess Celestia."
"Today I learned something amazing."
"Everypony everywhere has a special
magical connection with her friends..."
"...maybe even before she's met them."
"If you're feeling lonely and you're
still searching for your true friends..."
"...just look up in the sky."
"Who knows? Maybe you and your future
best friends are all looking at the same rainbow."
Gross!
When did you get so cheesy?
Just write it, Spike.
﻿
Let's quiet down, please. We have
a very important lesson to get to.
Thank you.
Today, we are going to be
talking about cutie marks.
Boring.
You can all see my cutie mark, can't you?
Like all ponies, I wasn't born with a cutie mark.
My flank was blank.
Awww, the's tho prethious!
Then one day, when I was about you age...
...I woke up to find that a
cutie mark had appeared!
Look at her hair!
Yes, I know. But honestly, that's how
everypony was wearing their mane back then.
I had decided to become a teacher.
And the flowers symbolized my hope that
I could help my future students bloom...
...if I nurtured them with knowledge.
The smiles represented the cheer I hoped to bring
to my little ponies while they were learning.
Now, can anyone tell me when
a pony gets his or her cutie mark?
Oh, oh, oh!
When the dithcovers that thertain
thomething that maketh her thpecial.
That's right, Twist.
A cutie mark appears on a pony's flank...
...when he or she finds that certain something...
...that makes them different
from every other pony.
Discovering what makes you unique isn't
something that happens overnight.
And no amount of hoping, wishing or begging
will make a cutie mark appear before it's time.
What?
Apple Bloom!
Are you passing a note?
What could be so important that it
couldn't wait until after class?
It's blank!
Reminds you of anypony?
Want thome thweet? I've got thome peppermint thticks.
I made them mythelf.
They'll make you thmile!
No...
I don't know why we had to sit through
a lecture about getting a cutie mark.
I mean, waiting for your
cutie mark is so last week.
You've got yours...
...I just got mine.
We all have them already.
I mean, almost all of us have them already.
Don't worry, you two. You're still totally
invited to my cuteceañera this weekend.
It's going to be amazing.
It's a party celebrating me
and my fantastic cutie mark.
How could it not be?
Bump, bump
sugar lump rump!
Gimme a break.
See you this weekend...!
Blank Flanks!
It's not fair! It's just not fair!
Oh, don't get your mane in a tangle.
You'll get your cutie mark.
Everypony gets one eventually.
But I don't want one "eventually".
I want one right now!
I can't go to Diamond Tiara's
cuteceañera without one. I just can't!
'course you can!
You know, I was the last pony in my class to get
a cutie mark. And I couldn't be prouder of it.
I knew my future was to run Sweet Apple Acres
and these bright shiny apples sealed the deal.
Come to think of it, Granny Smith
was the last on in her class too.
Same with Big Macintosh.
I really don't see how that's
supposed to make me feel better.
That probably means that being the last one in
your class to get a cutie mark runs in the family.
Runs in the family...?
Runs in the family!
RUNS IN THE FAMILY!
You've got apples for your cutie mark...
Granny Smith has an apple pie...
Big Macintosh has an apple half...
My unique talent must have
some to do with apples!
Apples! Apples! Apples!
Apples.
Get you delicious, nutritious apples here!
Delicious and nutritious! And so many uses!
You can eat 'em...
Play with them...
Hey, watch it!
Create fine art for your home with them...
You have to be crazy not to get
a bushel of your very own.
She's so creative...!
You, sir!
Care about some apples?
Uh... no thanks.
Why not?
I have plenty at home.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm pretty sure...
You're *pretty* sure.
But You're not absolutely, positively
completely super-duper sure. Are you?
Uh... if I buy some apples,
will you please leave me alone?
Awright!
You forgot your change!
That's how you sell some
apples and get a cutie mark.
So, what does my cutie mark look like?
A shoppin' bag full of apples?
A satisfied customer eatin' an apple?
Maybe I gotta increase my sales figures first.
You touch it, you buy it!
We take cash or credit.
I'm sorry, ma'am...
Ma'am!
Now, Apple Bloom, you can't just...
That'll be four bits.
I didn't put those in my bag!
Likely story... Four bits, lady!
Apple Bloom!
I am really, really sorry about that. She's new.
Here, take these. No charge.
And these.
And these.
Ya'll come back, now, ya hear?
What?
Sorry, little sis, but your
applesellin' days are over.
What?! But how else am I
gonna get my cutie mark?
Home! Now!
Listen, sugar cube. I know it's hard
to wait for your very own cutie mark.
But you just can't force it.
Besides, your not that grown up just yet.
Ain't there other fillies
in your class without one?
Well... Twist doesn't have hers yet.
Do you think it'd feel better
if you went to the party with her?
Well, there you go!
Bet you and Twist will have
a great time together.
Now run along and find your friend.
You're sure you don't want me to stick
around till the end of the market?
Hey! Who's been using my racket?!
Yeah. I'm sure.
Oh. What'th up, Apple Bloom?
So I was thinkin'.
Maybe we could go to Diamond
Tiara's cuteceañera together?
I don't have a cutie mark, you
don't have a cutie mark...
Well, um...
Ithn't my cutie mark thwell?
I've alwayth loved making
my own favorite thweets...
...but it took me thome time to dithcover
that it wath my thuper thpecial talent.
Pretty thweet, huh?
Yeah... Pretty... sweet.
Hey... This doethn't mean we can't
go to the cutetheañera together.
You're thtill gonna go to the party, aren't you?
Of course she will.
It's not like being the only pony there
without a cutie mark would be, like...
...the most embarrassing thing ever.
Whoa...
Looks like somepony's got a dark
cloud hanging over her head.
Let me do something about that.
What's the matter, kid?

I WANT IT NOW!
Cutie mark? I can get you a cutie mark like that.
Applejack says these things take time.
I have to just wait for it to happen.
Why wait for something to happen
when you can make it happen?
But Applejack says...
Hey, who are you gonna listen to?
Applejack...
...or the pony who was first in
her class to get a cutie mark?
I always liked flying n' all but
I was going nowhere in a hurry.
It wasn't until my very first race that
I discovered a serious need for speed.
And KAZAM!
This sweet baby appears as fast as a lighting.
That's right!
Stretch out those legs. Gotta be nice and loose.
The key here is to try as many things
as possible as quickly as possible.
One of them is bound to
lead to your cutie mark.
Are you ready?
I'm ready!
I said...
ARE YOU READY?!
I'M READY!
Jugglers, go!
Hang gliding, go!
Karate, go!
Kite flying, go!
Ultra-Pony Roller Derby, go!
Tried that one... tried that one... tried that one...
Your new outfit is, like, perfect for the party.
I know. It totally shows off my new cutie mark.
I love being special.
Can you imagine how embarrassing
it must be to be not special?
I don't even want to, like, think about it.
Tried that one... Huh, tried that one...
I'm doomed. Doomed! I'll never find somethin' I'm good at.
You look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes.
Eatin' cupcakes?
Eating cupcakes?
Eating cupcakes!
I really appreciate all your help, Rainbow Dash.
You're really great coach and
I've learned a lot from you...
...and I'm sure I can learn a lot more, but...
I've got some cupcakes to eat!
See you at the cuteceañera!
Hold on, Pinkie Pie! I'm comin'!
I can't believe I didn't think of this.
A cupcake eatin' cutie mark. It's so obvious!
Now, where are those cupcakes?
I'm ready to chow down!
I don't have any cupcakes.
Oh.
But you look like you'd be good
at helping me make some!
I guess, uh, "makin' cupcakes"
cutie mark could work too.
All you have to do is take a cup of flour,
add it to the mix.
Now just take a little something sweet, not sour.
A bit of salt, just a pinch.
Baking these treats is such a cinch,
add a teaspoon of vanilla.
Add a little more and you count to four
and you never get your fill of...!
Cupcakes, so sweet and tasty!
Cupcakes, don't be too hasty!
Cupcakes! Cupcakes, cupcakes, cupcakes!
Hot! Hot! Hot!
Those look much better than the last batch.
Guess I'm not cut out to be a baker either.
I just have to face it.
I'm gonna have a blank flank forever.
What about that?
What about what?
Is there some on my flank?
Is there, is there, is there?
A cutie mark! It's up!
A... a measuring cup? No.
A mixin' bawl? No.
Are those cupcakes?
A tower of cupcakes, maybe?
Flour! It's flour!
Yay! I guessed it! What game
do you wanna play next?
Please say bingo, please say bingo...
Whoa...! What's been going on in here?
We've been making cupcakes. Wanna try one?
No, thank you. Not that they don't look...
...delicious.
Twilight! You have to help me!
What's the matter?

...RIGHT NOW!
I don't follow.
How can I help you?
You can use your magic to
make my cutie mark appear.
Oh no, Apple Bloom.
A cutie mark is something that
a pony has to discover for herself.
Please, Twilight. Just try.
I'm sorry, but...
Oh please, please, please, please, pleeeaaase!
Alright, alright.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Yes! I knew you could do...
...it.
I'm sorry, sweetie. But I told you...
Try again! Try again!
Told you that not even magic can make
a cutie mark appear before it's time.
It's hopeless. Hopeless!
I just won't go to the party. I can't go!
Everyone will just laugh at me and
make fun of me and call me names.
It'll be the worst time of my life.
I'm sure it won't be as bad as all that.
Forget it. There's no way I'm going to that...
...party.
How could I've forgotten the time?
How could I've forgotten
Pinkie Pie was hostin' the party?
How could I've forgotten
it was at Sugarcube Corner?
Don't forget you party hat...
...Forgetty Forgetterson.
I have to get out of here
before anypony sees me.
Hey!
It's my cuteceañera.
I'm supposed to get the first bite of cake.
Okay, Apple Bloom. Almost there...
Apple Bloom! You made it!
After I heard about Twist, I was
afraid you wouldn't show up.
I sure am glad you came to your senses
about this all cutie mark thing.
These things happen when these
things are supposed to happen.
Tryin' to rush it will just drive you crazy.
I'll let you be. Looks like your
friends want to talk to you.
Well, well, well. Look who's here.
Nice outfit.
Just someth'n I, uh, pulled together last minute.
It really shows off your cutie mark.
Oh, wait. That's right. You don't have one.
I have a cutie mark.
What? Since when?
Since, um... earlier today.
Oh really? Let's see it.
I shouldn't. I couldn't.
My cutie mark is so unbelievably amazing.
I'm afraid that if I showed it off...
...everyone would start paying
attention to me instead of you.
Outshined at your own cuteceañera?
Can you imagine how
embarrassing that would be?
Uh, forget it.
I didn't really want to see it anyway.
Okay! Well, I'm gonna go mingle.
Enjoy your party!
Oh no!
Wow, that IS an amazing cutie mark.
Nice try...
Blank Flank!
You got a problem with blank flanks?
I said, you got a problem with blank flanks?
The problem is, I mean, she's,
like, totally not special.
No, it means she's full of potential.
It means she can be great at anything.
The possibilities are...
..."like, endless".
She could be a great scientist...
...or a amazing artist...
...or a famous writer.
She could even be
mayor of Ponyville some day!
And she's not stuck being stuck-up like you two.
Hey! This is MY party,
why are you two on HER side?
Because...
You don't have your cutie marks either?!
I thought I was the only one!
We thought we were the only two.
I for one think you are three very lucky fillies.
Lucky? How can they be lucky?
They still get to experience
the thrill of discovering who they are...
...and what they're meant to be.
And they've got all the time
in the world to figure it out.
Not just an afternoon.
Wow, Apple Bloom.
Do you really think you can be a mayor?
I wish I could be a scientist.
Maybe I got my cutie mark too soon?
Hey, what's everypony doing?
This is my party, everypony's supposed
to be paying attention to me!
Whatever. We still think you're
losers. Right, Diamond Tiara?
Bump, bump, sugar lump...
Not now, Silver Spoon.
Name's Scootaloo.
And I'm Sweetie Belle.
Apple Bloom.
This thong is tho thuper!
So I was thinkin'. Now that we're friends...
I mean, we are friends, right?
How could we not be? We're totally alike.
We don't have cutie marks...
Diamond Tiara and Silver
Spoon drive us crazy...
Totally crazy!
Now that we're friends...
...what if the three of us work together to find
out who we are and what we're supposed to be?
We could form our own secret society.
I'm liking this idea!
A secret society! Yeah.
We need a name for it though.
The Cutie Mark Three?
The Cutastically Fantastics?
How about...
The Cutie Mark Crusaders?
It's perfect!
This is gonna be so great!
We're gonna be unstoppable!
What do you say we celebrate
with some of these delicious cupcakes?
Not the cupcakes! Trust me.
Let's see if there are any cookies!
Yeah!
Come on!
"Dearest Princess Celestia."
"I am happy to report that
one of your youngest subjects..."
"...has learned a valuable
lesson about friendship."
"Sometimes the thing you think will cause
you to lose friends and feel left out..."
"...can actually be the thing that
helps you make your closest friends..."
"...and realize how special you are."
Oh, I thought I already-
Oh, and can't forget I've got to-
Are you sure I can't help?
I could-
Maybe just a-
No thanks.
How about-
Just stand over there.
But-
Where you'll be out of the way.
Ribbon...ribbon! Where's the ribbon?!
I got it!
Whoa!
there, where I'll be...out of the way.
Big adventure
Tons of fun
A beautiful heart
Faithful and strong
Sharing kindness
It's an easy feat
And magic makes it all complete, yeah
Won't you at least let me help you clean up?
I'm sorry, sis.
I just thought that if I could help,
I might find my special gift and finally earn my cutie mark.
I understand, it's just that...
I need this time to fill this order without any...complications.
Okay. All done.
Now, back to work. I've lost a lot of
time, and I cannot have any more interruptions.
you were open, but I must have been mistaken.
I was so wrapped up in my work that I
forgot you were bringing Opalescence back from her grooming!
I just don't understand how you're able to do it!
I can't get near her without getting a swipe from her claws.
Oh, no! I wouldn't. I couldn't!
I-I don't really have any control over when that happens.
I-it just happens.
No, I'm just good with animals.
It's my special gift, you know.
Well, you should have a picture of Opal
as a cutie mark instead of those butterflies.
Maybe I can be good with animals, too!
...Or not.
I'm sorry I can't invite you to stay and chat, Fluttershy.
I've bitten off a bit more than I can chew with this order.
But you're not eating anything.
No, Sweetie. It's an expression.
It means that I've taken on more work than I can handle.
I've got twenty of these special robes to make tonight!
They're due in Trottingham [Nottingham] tomorrow morning.
See? I've lined them in this special gold silk.
It took SO long to make, but I think
it adds just the right touch. Don't you?
These are lovely, but 20? By tonight?
How will you get it all done?
Well, I, uh-
Oh oh oh! Maybe I could...
I'll manage.
Well, maybe I should get out of your mane so you can work.
Hi, Fluttershy! Hi, Rarity!
Hello, uh, girls...
Hey, Sweetie Belle!
Scootaloo! Applebloom!
You ready for tonight?
Yep! Cutie Mark Planning Session is a go!
Tonight is the night we each try to find our own special talent!
Even if it takes us all night!
I'm ready! You ready?!
Very ready!
And...look what I made us!
What does that patch on your cape mean?
We're on a crusade, a MISSION!
T'find our cutie marks!
I lined them with this special gold silk.
It took SO long to make, but I think
it adds just the right touch, don't you?
Ooooh!
Sweetie Belle! What have you done?!
That was the last of the gold silk!
Oh, now I'll have to make more!
Oh, I hope I can make more...
I'm gonna have to work all night!
Which means, sorry girls. I'm afraid the Crusader Sleepover is canceled.
What?!
I just won't have any time to watch you if
I want to get these robes delivered on time.
But-
I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle; it's just the way it has to be.
I, uh, I suppose I could take them for the night.
I couldn't ask you to do that.
Oh, it's no problem at all.
Have you...MET my sister and her friends?
"A problem" is all it would be.
You've seen how well I handle small creatures!
I suppose that's true, and I DO
have a lot of work to do...
Come on, it'll be fun.
I assure you, they're quite a handful.
These sweet little angels?
Well...all right.
So cute. Wait for me!
Oh, won't this be ever so fun?
We can have a nice little tea party,
and braid each others' tails, and sit quietly and color,
and tell each other fairy tales, and-
Hello, Fluttershy.
Oh! Hello, Twilight!
Where are you off to?
I'm heading to the Everfree Forest to Zecora's
to get some of my favorite tea.
Of course! How about you? What are you doing with the girls?
Rarity has a big order to fill tonight,
so I volunteered to take the girls over to my cottage for a sleepover.
Wow, sounds like everypony has their hooves full today.
Taking care of those three fillies, all by yourself?
You sure you can handle it?
What? These sweet little angels?
They'll be no problem at all.
Wow, look at this place!
Okay, girls, what should we do?
I'm gonna get my mark first!
Girls...?
Nuh-uh!
Should we-
I AM!
Girls! Okay, now, settle-
I'M staying up all night!
Me too!
Me three!
I know you're excited, but-
girls, be careful with the-
oh, uh, girls...
So! What do you wanna do? Play a game?
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
And we want t'crusade for our cutie marks!
Um...I dunno. How about a nice, QUIET little tea party...?
Or we could go adventuring in the Everfree Forest!
YEAH!
It's filled with far too many strange creatures.
But you could go with us and we could catch those creatures.
We could be, um...creature catchers!
Rarr! I am a dangerous creature from the Everfree Forest! Rarr!
I am Sweetie Belle, the Creature Catcher,
and I'm here to catch you!
You can never catch me!
I am far too POWERFUL and DANGEROUS!
You cannot run from me!
Um, uh, maybe that's not such a-
now, girls, how about we do some nice coloring.
Come back, dangerous creature,
so I can catch you!
Never!
Careful...you don't...! ...break anything.
Yeah, sorry.
Oh girls, it's okay, I-
I KNOW!
We could be Cutie Mark Crusader Carpenters!
Hammer!
Hammer!
Hammer!
Hammer!
Hammer.
Hammer.
Um, THAT doesn't look like a table.
Somepony needs t'put this thing outta its misery.
We are definitely not Cutie Mark Carpenters.
Well, now that we've gotten that out
of the way, how about a game?
It's called, "Shhh."
What's that?
Well, it's a game about who can be quiet the longest. Sound fun?
I'm the world champ, you know. Bet you can't beat me!
I lose!
Me too!
Me three!
Okay! Now what can we do?
Ooh! How about Cutie Mark Crusader Coal Miners?
YEAH!
Aww...
I mean, it's time for bed, don't you think?
and warm in your snuggly-wuggly widdle beds?
"...Snuggly-wuggly?" But we have more crusadin' t'do!
We've got plans!
And capes!
Um, okay. Um, maybe the crusading can wait until morning?
How are we gonna find our special talent in our sleep?
lovely little dream about your special talent.
But we're not even tired!
How about I sing you a lullaby?
Yeah!
Hush now, quiet now
It's time to lay your sleepy head
Hush now, quiet now
It's time to go to bed
I know this one!
Oh, how WONDERFUL! Why don't you sing it with me?
Hush now,
quiet now
It's time to lay your sleepy head
Said hush now, quiet now
Driftin' [Driftin'!] off to sleep
The exciting day behind you
Driftin' [Driftin'!] off to sleep
Hush now, quiet now
Lay your sleepy head
Said hush now, quiet now
It's time to go to BEEEEEEED!
OW!
What is THAT?
Fluttershy, your chickens are on the loose!
I wonder what could've caused it...
Don't worry, Fluttershy! The Cutie Mark Crusaders will handle this!
Cutie Mark Crusader Chicken Herders! YAY!
No, I don't think that's a- ah, come back! Please!
Come on,
girls, the chickens are fine-oh, girls, um...
GIRLS!
Come on. In you go.
There's some good chickens.
Okay, you three, isn't it about time you got into bed?
So, no more crusading for tonight, all right?
Yes, Fluttershy!
We promise, Fluttershy!
G'night, Fluttershy!
Okay. Good night.
There's not much we can do from this room,
unless we become Cutie Mark Crusader Cottage Cleaners.
No thanks...
Well, we have t'think of somethin'.
We can't just waste this opportunity t'find out what our special talents are.
Hey, girls!
Look! Some of the chickens may have escaped!
Into the forest!
I mean, all I needed to do was just show them who's in charge.
Nothing's gonna get past Fluttershy!
Good with animals, good with kids.
Wait up!
Mm, peace and quiet.
Girls?
Girls...?
Elizabeak! She's missing!
Girls?!
They must have gone looking for my missing chicken!
Those girls have REALLY done it this time!
They've really bitten off more than they can chew!
Oh, just like me.
I never should have offered to watch them...
Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!
What are you DOING?
Callin' for the chicken.
That is NOT how you call a chicken.
I know THAT'S not the way.
Then show me.
I don't have to show you.
Yer just chicken!
Am NOT!
Oh, wait! NOW I know how to call a chicken!
Scoot-Scootaloooo!
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.
You also forgot how to call a chicken.
Why, you...!
Come on, guys! We're not gonna find
the chicken or our cutie marks by arguing.
Maybe that's our special talent! Arguing!
Is not!
Is too!
Is not!
Is too! Anything yet?
Nope.
Here, chick-chick-chick-chick, bawkbawkbawkbawkbawkbagaaawk!
Get a hold of yourself, Fluttershy!
Just put one hoof in front of the other.
Twilight...? Is that you?
Thank goodness you're here. I need your help.
The girls are out here somewhere, and I'm afraid that they're-
What's happened to you?!
Oh no! If you've been turned to stone, then that means-
Don't move. I'll be back for you.
Is not!
Is too!
IS NOT!
IS TOO!
Besides, what would the cutie mark of somepony
whose talent is arguing even LOOK like?
Fluttershy?
Girls! Thank goodness I found you!
Fluttershy, what-
But we haven't found the chicken yet!
There's no time for that! There's a cockatrice on the loose!
A cocka-what now?
head of a chicken and the body of a snake.
Now, come on!
The head of a chicken and the body of a snake?
That doesn't sound scary; that sounds silly.
Why, if I ever saw one o'those "cocka-thingies" face-to-face,
I'd laugh at how silly it was.
NO! NEVER look one in the eye!
If you look a cockatrice in the eye-
THE CHICKEN!
Girls, wait!
Here, chicken, chicken, chicken!
There he is!
Two chickens?
I-I thought only one escaped!
Grab them both!
See? Now we have to-
you are, going around turning others into stone?!
You should be ASHAMED of yourself!
I have half a mind to find your mother and
tell her what you've been up to, young man!
Now, you go over there and turn Elizabeak
and my friend Twilight back to normal,
and don't EVER let me catch you doing this again!
Do you understand me?
Yeah, fine!
Thanks to that stare of yours!
You're like the Queen of Stares! You're the-
Stare Master!
We're sorry we snuck out of the house and into the forest.
Yeah. We'll listen to you from now on.
We promise.
Well, you'd better, or I'll give you...The Stare.
...And that's when it brought you back from stone.
This is gonna make quite a letter to the princess.
I was wrong about you. You certainly do know how to handle those girls.
Hm? How so?
I assumed that I'd be just as good
with kids as I am with animals.
Boy, was I wrong.
I really learned the hard way not to
bite off more than I could chew.
You and Rarity both. Good morning, Rarity!
Did you finish all those capes?
I have to admit, if you hadn't come along, I might not have.
Thanks again.
Won't you stay for some tea?
I really must get back to the shop and clean up.
Girls, get your things. Time to go.
Your things! Girls...!
Yes, Fluttershy.
You called?
Go and get your things. Rarity is here to see you home.
Of course, Fluttershy! Right away!
I guess I'm just as good with kids as I am with animals.
use your help with Opal...
Of course.
How about later today?
How about...now?
My Little Pony
My Little Pony, friends
GOM Player is used by millions of
people around the world, find out why!
Oh. Hi, Pinkie Pie.
This is your singing telegram
I hope it finds you well
You're invited to a party
Cause we think you're really swell
Gummy's turning one year old
So help us celebrate
The cake will be delicious
The festivities first-rate
There will be games and dancing
Bob for apples, cut a rug
And when the party's over
We'll gather round for a group hug
No need to bring a gift
Being there will be enough
Birthdays mean having fun with friends
Not getting lots of stuff
It won't be the same without you
So we hope that you say yes
So please, oh please, R.S.V.P.
And come and be our guest
Next time I think I'll just
pass out written invitations.
Nice one. Now let me show you
how it's really done.
Hey, girls!
Hey, Pinkie Pie.
Howdy!
Just wanted to tell you how happy I am
that you could make it to Gummy's party.
Are you kiddin'? I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.
Me neither.
When Pinkie Pie throws a party, I am there!
TADA!
Ah, it's just a boring old apple.
Don't worry. There're plenty of other surprises in there.
What kind of surprises?
I can't tell you that, silly.
Then it wouldn't be a surprise!
This punch is simply divine.
Is this the same recipe you used
for your "Spring has Sprung" party?
No, something new.
It's Gummy's favorite!
Ooh! This is my jam!
Having fun?
A blast!
You always throw the best parties, Pinkie Pie.
They're always the best parties,
cause my best friends are always there!
Come on, everypony!
Gummy wants to dance!
Go Gummy! It's ya birthday!
Go Gummy! It's ya birthday!
Hooie! I am beat.
Haven't danced that much since...
Well... since you last party.
Thanks again for the invite!
See you later, birthday alligator!
Bravo for hosting yet another delightful soirée.
It's been lovely.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
There's still some cake left.
Uh... I think I'm gonna pass.
Great party, though.
We should do this again soon.
We should do this again soon!
Oh. Hi, Pinkie...
It's soon!
Pardon me?
You said we should have
another party soon and... it's soon!
Here is your invitation!
"You're invited to Gummy's after-birthday party."
"This afternoon at 3 o'clock."
All our bestest friends are invited...
...and here's gonna be dancing and games
and cake and ice cream and punch...
This afternoon?
As in "this afternoon" this afternoon?
Yes, indeedy!
Oh, gosh.
I wish I could make it but I've
gotten a bit behind in my studies.
I've really gotta hit the books.
I understand. Your studies come first.
But don't worry! We'll be sure
to save you some cake.
Please do!
Oh! And Twilight, you shouldn't hit the books.
You should really just read them.
I'll keep that in mind.
Oh hi, Pinkie Pie.
What brings you here round these parts?
Who's ready to shake their hoof-thang?
It's an invitation at Gummy's
after-birthday party this afternoon!
There's gonna be dancing and games
and cake and ice cream and punch...
This afternoon?
As in "this afternoon" this afternoon?
That's funny. That's just what Twilight said.
And the answer is "Yes, it's this afternoon".
Oh... Well, I... I, uh...
I don't think I can make it, cause, uh...
I have to, uh...
Uh, you know... I, uh...
Pick apples!
Yep, apples, cause that's what we do.
With, uh... apples. We, uh...
Pick 'em.
Okie dokie lokie!
A party is still a party,
even if there're only three guests.
Anything else I can do for you, most beautiful one?
Mmm... Perhaps you could take a bath.
How do I put this delicately...
You smell like a rotten apple core...
...that's been wrapped in moldy hay
and dipped in dragon perspiration.
Ooh, love the new hat.
Very modern. What's the occasion?
Gummy's after-birthday party is this afternoon.
I'm delivering the invitations.
The party is this afternoon?
As in "this afternoon" this afternoon?
It's so strange. Everypony keep saying that?
Oh, do they?
I know it's short notice, but we had
such a great time at this birthday party...
...I thought we could have even
more fun at this after-birthday party.
And I'm sure that we would,
but I'm going to have to decline.
I have to... wash my hair.
Don't be silly. Your hair doesn't look dirty.
It doesn't?
Nope.
See? Dirty.
I have to go.
Huh. No Twilight, no Applejack, no Rarity.
Oh well. A party is still a party,
even with only two guests.
This afternoon?
As in...
Yes!
As in "this afternoon" this afternoon.
Oh man, we'd love to, but...
...we're... house-sitting this afternoon.
Huh... Both of you?
It's a... a big house.
Uh, look at the time!
We'd really better get going.
Wait!
Maybe I could bring you some
after-birthday cake and ice cream?
Who you house-sitting for?
Harry.
Harry?
Yeah, I don't think you known him.
That's strange. I know just about
everypony around here.
He's... a bear.
A bear?
Yep! He's a bear, all right.
And he'll be pretty upset if we don't
get over to his house soon, heh.
Wait!
There's a bear around here who lives in a house?
It's... really more of a cave.
But he sticks the place up
so much it feels like a house.
And, uh... he wants us to look after
his house, uh, cave while he's...
At the beach!
He's vacationing at the beach?
Yep! He loves to...
Collect seashells.
Play volleyball.
Play volleyball.
Collect seashells.
Collect volleyball.
Play seashells.
Gotta go!
Something strange is definitely
going on around here, Gummy.
Sure Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to
house-sit for that vacationing bear...
...but what are the chances all my other friends
would have plans this afternoon too?
Rarity has to wash her hair...
Applejack has to pick apples...
Twilight is behind on her studies
and has to hit the books...
The more I think about it, the more
those are starting to sound like...
Excuses!
That didn't look like studying.
Or hitting.
Oh! You must be here for...
Shh!
Is Pinkie Pie around?
Oh, I don't think so.
Good.I don't want her
to know anything about this.
Yes, of course. I'll be right back.
But... we're friends.
What wouldn't Twilight want me
to know anything about?
She's coming back.
There you go.
Thanks. And remember, not a word to Pinkie Pie.
Hey! What's with the tin can?
Time to get to the bottom of things.
I think our cover's been blown.
I need a new disguise.
She didn't see you at the sweet shop, did she?
I don't think so.
Oh, good. I'd hate for her to ruin everything.
Me too.
Have you seen her?
Not since this morning.
Me neither. Can you believe she was planning on
throwing an after-birthday party *today*?
I'm just glad I was able to come up
with an excuse for why I couldn't be there.
Me too. This obviously
going to be so much better.
As long as we keep her from
finding out about it, it will.
See you later!
I thought everypony loved my parties.
Hi, Pinkie Pie!
Uh-oh.
Rainbow Dash! Wait!
WHERE'RE YOU GOING?!
WHAT'S THE REAL REASON YOU DON'T
WANNA COME TO GUMMY'S PARTY?!
WHAT'S IN THOSE BAGS?!
Applejack! We have a problem!
I know you're in there!
Oh, uh... howdy partner!
Mind if I... take a look inside the barn?
No... I mean, yes... I mean,
you can't come in here.
Rainbow Dash just went in there.
Oh, well, she was just
bringin' in some... supplies.
Yep, supplies for the... renovation.
Fixin' up the whole thing, top to bottom.
Uh... lotsa construction going on
in there right now!
You heard her. Construction!
Yup! Construction. That's my story
and I'm stickin' to it, heh.
Okie dokie lokie.
Secrets and lies. It's all secrets
and lies with those ponies.
They're up to something, Gummy.
Something they don't want me to know about.
Well, I'm gonna know about it.
I'm gonna know about it big time!
And I know just who's gonna
tell me all about it.
TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT BIG TIME!
Wow... Nice spread!
It's all yours, Spike.
All you have to do is talk.
That's it? Oh, you got it.
Okay... Uh, beautiful weather we're having, eh?
I love sunny spring day, don't you?
The birds chirping, the flowers blooming...
No, no, no.
Talk about our friends.
Oh. Okay.
Let's see. There's Twilight Sparkle,
she's a unicorn.
Good with magic, real brainiac.
And then we got Rarity. Total knockout!
Twilight seems to think I don't have a chance
with her, but... eh, what does she know?
Let's see, there's... there's Fluttershy,
a pegasus afraid of height.
Huh, what's up with that?
No! You're not understanding me!
I want you to confess!
Confess?
CONFESS!
I'm the one who spilled juice all over Twilight's
copy of Magical Mysteries and Practical Potions!
And?
And I'm the one who used up
all the hot water in Ponyville yesterday...
...when I took a seven-hour bubble bath.
And?!
And sometimes, when no one's around...
...I do this.
Looking good, Spike. Looking real good.
No... No! No! NO!!!
Wh... What do you wanna hear?
Tell me what you want me to say and I'll say it!
Tell me that my friends are
lying to me and avoiding me...
...because they don't like my parties and
THEY DON'T WANNA BE MY FRIENDS ANYMORE!!!
Your friends are all lying to you and avoiding you...
...cause they don't like your parties and
they don't wanna be your friends anymore!
AHA! I KNEW IT!
Oh no.
My friends don't like my parties and
they don't wanna be my friends anymore.
Uh... So...
Thank you all so much for coming!
It means so much to Gummy.
CouLd i HavE sOme MoRe PunCh?
Well, of course you can
have more punch, Mr. Turnip.
tHis iS onE grEat PartY!

You know what? I'm not gonna
speak to them ever again.
And I'm not gonna invite them
to another party as long as I live.
The don't DESERVE to be invited to my party!
Not after the way they've been acting.
deSPicAblE!
bUncHa lOsErs!
yES, ZaT's RIGht.
wEll dOnE!
YEs!
yOu ShOw 'eM!
Who could that be?
Hey there, Pinkie Pie.
Sorry I was in such a rush earlier.
Has some place to be and
couldn't slow down and say hello.
You know how it goes.
I know how it goes, all right.
Yeah... So, why don't you come
with me over to Sweet Apple Acres?
No thanks. I'm spending time with my real friends.
Isn't that right, Madame La Flour?
oUi! zat is CorrEcT, MadAMe.
Uh... Pinkie Pie?
Another slice of cake, Sir Lintsalot?
i'D LOve One.
Alrighty. Whaddya say we get on outta
Creepytown and head over to Applejack's...
She'S Not gOinG anyWHeRe.
I most certainly am not.
I'm having a wonderful time right here.
You should really just come with me.
you hEard tHe lADy!
sHE aIn'T goinG NowHerE, ChuMp!
Who you calling a chump, chump!
That's it. Party's over.
Come on, Pinkie Pie.
No!
Pinkie Pie, let's go!
I said no!
You, ugh... have to... come with... me!
No... I... don't!
Oh, you want to do this the hard way?
We'll do this the hard way!
We're... here...
Surprise!
I really thought she'd be more excited.
Excited?! EXCITED?!
Why would I be excited to attend
my own farewell party?!
Farewell party?
Yes! You don't like me anymore so you
decided to kick me out of the group...
...and throw a great, big party to celebrate.
A "Farewell of Pinkie Pie" party.
Why in the world would you think
we didn't like you anymore, sugar cube?
Why?
Why?!
WHY?!
Because you've been LYING
to me and avoiding me all day!
That's why!
Uh, yeah. Because we wanted
your party to be a surprise.
We've been planning this party
for such a long time...
...we had to make excuses for why
we couldn't attend Gummy's party...
...so that we could everything ready for yours.
If this is a farewell party...
...why does the cake I picked up
from Sugarcube Corner say...
..."Happy birthday, Pinkie Pie"?
Because it's my birthday!
Oh, how could I have forgotten my own birthday?
And you like me so much, you decided to
throw me a surprise party.
That's what we've been trying to tell you, darling.
You girls are the best friends ever!
How could I have ever doubted you?
It's okay, Pinkie Pie.
It could have happened to any of us.
I'm just glad I haven't been
replaced by a bucket of turnips.
Huh?
You don't wanna know.
Alright, girls! Enough of this gabbin'.
Let's party!
"Dear Princess Celestia."
"I am writing to you
from the most delightful party."
"I'm not only having
a great time with my friends..."
"...but also was given the opportunity
to learn a valuable lesson about friendship."
"Always expect the best from your friends
and never assume the worst."
"Rest assured that a good friend always
has your best interests at heart."
"You faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."
You girls wouldn't mind if we celebrated Gummy's
after-birthday party too, would you?
His party was cut short and
he's pretty upset about it.
Why not? Let's have a party for Gummy.
﻿
Perfect.
Just take the broken limbs down, Rarity.
Don't you all care about nothin' other than prettifyin'?
Somepony has to.
You are making an absolute mess
of the town square, Applejack.
Yeah, well, the storm's gonna
make an even bigger mess...
...if we don't prune all these loose branches
so they don't tumble down on anypony.
I simply cannot imagine why the pegasus ponies
would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening...
...and ruin what could have been
a glorious sunny day.
Think more practical-like, will ya?
They accidentally skipped
a scheduled sprinkle last week, so...
...we need a doozy of a downpour
to make up for it, is all.
Oh no! My wonderfully styled
mane shall be ruined!
You shoulda hurried up and
finished the job, already.
It's coming down too fast!
Help me!
There. Hunker down to your heart's content
whilst I finish this.
Oo, no no nooo!
What now?
I'd prefer not to get my hooves muddy.
Gah. There is just no pleasin' ya, is there?
Everything's gotta be just so.
Well, and how does muddying my hooves
serve any useful purpose?
You wouldn't know useful
if it came up and bit you.
That doesn't even make any sense.
Does so.
Does not.
Does so.
Does not.
Does so.
Does not.
Does so infinity. Hah!
Does not infinity plus one. Heh.
What's say we go our separate ways before
one of us says something she will regret?
I reckon y'all are gonna say
something you'll regret first.
On the contrary. I believe it shall almost certainly
be you who says something you will regret first.
I'm not sayin' anythin'.
Nor am I.
You'll just be on your way then?
After you.
Perhaps we should stick together
for now and find some shelter.
Uh-huh. Perhaps we should.
And fast.
Nice and dry under here.
Sorta.
Ooh! Unacceptable.
Applejack! Rarity!
Applejack! Rarity!
Twilight?
Come inside, girls, quick.
Whoa, Nelly.
Is inside a tree really the best place
to be in a lightin' storm?
It is if you have a magical lighting rod
protecting your home like I do.
Come on in.
We are most grateful for your invitation.
Thank ya kindly for your hospitality.
Uh...
Do be a polite houseguest and
go wash up, please, won't you?
If I gotta spend one more second
with that fussbudget Rarity today...
...I can't be held responsible
for what I'm gonna do.
Some storm, huh?
The pegasus ponies sure have
outdone themselves this time.
I hope you and Applejack
don't have any trouble getting home.
It may indeed be a problem.
Well, you're welcome to stay if need be.
Spike is away in Canterlot on royal business.
I'm home all alone tonight.
You and Applejack should totally sleep over!
We'll have a slumber party.
I've always wanted one of those.
Oh! Oh, goodness.
Uh... I do believe I have another
engagement scheduled for this evening...
...that completely slipped my
mind until just now, hahahah.
Oh, silly me. I can't possibly stay here all night...
...with Applejack.
All You've Ever Wanted to Know
My own personal copy.
It's a fantastic reference guide.
You should see the table of contents.
I've been waiting for a chance to use it
and today is the day.
This is gonna be so great!
Yes, uh... Great.
What in tarnation?!
Now wait just a goll-darn minute.
You made me wash the mud off my hooves...
...but it's okay for y'all
to have mud all over your faces?
Silly. This is called a mud mask.
It's to refresh and rejuvenate your complexion.
We're giving each other makeovers!
We have to do it. It says so in the book.
Everything You..."
Oh, hay. Would you look at the time.
I gotta skedaddle on home quick,
I'm powerful late for, uh...
...somethin'.
Uh, g'night!
Or maybe I'll sit here for a spell.
Hurray! Slumber party!
What in the world is this for?
To reduce the puffiness
around one's eyes, of course.
Puffiness-shmuffiness.
That's good eatin'.
Isn't this exciting?
We'll do everything by the book.
And that will make my
slumber party officially fun.
Did you hear that, Applejack?
You certainly would not want to do anything that
would ruin Twilight's very first slumber party...
...would you?
Of course not.
'n you wouldn't either, I reckon?
So do we have an agreement?
You betcha.
Oh! Gross!
You know, there's messy
and there's just plain rude.
You know, there's fussy and there's
just plain gettin' on my nerves.
Fortunately, I can get along with anypony,
no matter how difficult she may be.
Oh yeah?
Well, I'm the get-alonginest pony you're ever gonna meet.
That's not even a word.
This is gonna be the bestest slumber party ever! Yay!
Yay.
Sooo...
How are you "getting along" over there, Applejack?
Just fine, Rarity
This is so awesome.
check.
Ooh! It says here we have to
tell ghost stories. Who wants to go first?
Me!
I'd like to tell y'all a terrifying tale
of the prissy ghost...
...who drove everypony crazy
with unnecessary neatness.
I'm sure y'all are familiar with that one.
Never heard of it. But I have a much better one.
It's the horrifying story
of the messy, inconsiderate ghost...
...who irritated everypony
within the hundred miles.
That's not a real story. You made it up.
It is a ghost story. They're all made up.
I've got one!
This story's called
"The legend of the Headless Horse".
It was a dark and stormy night...
...just like this one. And three ponies
were having a slumber party.
Just. Like. This one.
...and just when the last pony
thought she was safe...
...there, standing right behind her.
Just inches away was...
The Headless Horse!
check.
Now, who wants s'mores?
...then you place one marshmallow
on the top of the chocolate...
...and be sure it's centered - that's critical...
...and then carefully put another
perfectly square graham cracker on the top.
Aaand... done! Ta-da!
Nah, you just eat 'em.
You could at least say "excuse me".
Oh, I was just about to
but you interrupted me.
Pardon.
check.
Now, the next item of fun we have to do is...
...Truth of Dare.
I dare Applejack to do something
carefully and neatly for a change.
Oh yeah? Well, I dare Rarity to lighten up...
...and stop obsessin' over every
last little detail for a change.
I think the truth of the matter...
...is that somepony could stand
to pay a little more attention to detail.
And I think the truth is somepony
ought to quit with their fussin'...
...so the rest of us can get things done.
Um... I don't think this is
how the game is supposed to work.
"You have to give an honest answer to any question
or do whatever anypony dares you to do."
I dare you to step outside...
...and let your precious
tidy mane get ruined again.
You have to. It's the rule.
HA!
Fine!
Okay. I dare Applejack to play dress up...
..in a frou-frou glittery lacey outfit.
Happy?
Very.
Um... do I ever get a turn?
I dare you to enter the next rodeo
when it comes to town.
I dare you *not* to enter the next rodeo
that comes to town.
I dare ya to not comb your mane
a hundred times for a bit!
And I dare you to comb yours just once!
I, uh... I think we should check off
Truth of Dare and move on.
Let's see what our next
fun-fun-fun thing is, shall we?
Hm... What does this mean?
Pillow fight?
Oh, please. I am not at all interested
in participating in something so crude.
IT... IS... ON!
Oh, I get it!
Pillow-fight.
Fun!
Uh... girls? Maybe we should take it down a notch.
I will if she will!
She started it!
Maybe we should just call it
a night and get some sleep.
Keep your muddy hooves on your side of the bed.
My hooves ain't muddy.
They were. There might still be a little on them.
There ain't. See?
Now who's bein' inconciderate?
I have to make the bed again
so the blanket will be right.
Get up!
Hey!
Uh-uh-uh.
You'll ruin it. You have to do it like this.
Yeah... that's not gonna happen.
GERONIMO!
Hey!
You did that on purpose.
Um.. yeah.
Get up so I can fix it again!
Can't hear ya, I'm asleep.
I ain't budgin'.
[You will if you want any blanket.]
[Give it back!]
[I will not!]
[Yes, you will!]
[Won't!]
[Will!]
[Won't!]
[Will!]
[Won't!]
[Will!]
ENOUGH!
It says right here that the number one thing...
...you're supposed to do at a
slumber party is have fun!
And thanks to you two I can't check that off.
I've been tryin' my darnest to get along!
No, it is I who have been trying *my* best.
No, it was me!
No, it was I!
Me!
I!
*I* hope you're happy. Both of you.
You've ruined my very first slumber party.
The makeover, the s'mores,
Truth of Dare, the pillow fight...
I mean, is there anything else
that could possible go wrong?
Sorry I asked.
You see? That's why we needed
to take down all those loose branches in town.
Not spiffy 'em up.
But I...
Out of my way, missy. Time's a-wastin'.
Wait! Stop! Don't!
No waitin'! No stopin'! Doin'!
And that, my friends, is what
we call gettin' 'er done.
I tried to tell you it would
come crashing down in here.
Well, you shoulda tried harder.
I'm mighty sorry, Twilight.
It's... well, it no okay!
It's a giant tree branch
in the middle of my bedroom!
And the book doesn't say anything about having
a giant tree branch in your slumber party.
Or at least I haven't found that entry yet.
What in tarnation are y'all doin' over there?
Cleaning up this mess somepony made.
Who was that again? Oh, right. That's you.
We gotta do somethin'!
Baking... BFFs... Brothers...
There's nothing in here about branches!
Rarity, for pony's sake!
Stop sweatin' small stuff
and help me get rid of this thing!
I said hussle over here and help me!
Look...
I'm sorry, alright?
What was that?
I said I'm sorry!
I shoulda listen to you when you noticed
where this here branch would end up.
You annoin' attention to detail
woulda save us from this whole mess.
But right now, you need to stop being so dang
fussy, pickin' up all those little things...
...and help me move the one big thing in here
that actually matters.
Please!
But I'll get all icky!
Consarnit...!
What a... You... I mean... Yes.
Ickiness is often a side effect of hard work.
But y'all need to get over it on account of
I just can't fix this mess I made myself.
I need your help.
Let's do this!
Well, they do have a section
about backyard slumber parties.
Is that what we're doing right now?
Does this count as camping?
I look awful.
Better?
Thanks.
Oh, pretty. Where did these come from?
They're not in the book either.
Is it bigger than a barn?
Nope.
Is it smaller than a saddle?
No. Only three of your twenty questions left.
Oh, we're never gonna guess
what you're thinkin' of. It could be anythin'.
Are we getting warmer?
Why? Is it too cold in here for you?
I can turn up the heat.
She means are we gettin'
any closer with our guesses.
Oh...! No.
And that technically counted as a question,
so only two more left.
Is it...
...a sixed-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted
mane and shootin' stars comin' out of his eyes?
Who flies through the air all over
the world to hide magic sparkly eggs?
That's it!
It is?
No.
It' that.
But it was just so nice to see
you two finally getting along...
...I wanted you to be able to win together.
See? We could have been
having fun like this all along.
If only somepony hadn't been so persnickety.
Well, maybe she wouldn't have been
if somepony else hadn't been so sloppy.
Sorry for bein' just a pain in the patootie.
Oh no, I'm sure I was much worse.
That's kind of you to say,
but I'm the one who's sorry.
Oh, I'm much more sorry than you are.
Are not.
Are too.
Are not.
Are too.
Are not.
Are too.
I declare my first slumber party a success!
check.
Now take two steps your left.
Uh, no. My left.
Whi... Which is it?
That mess is your fault, not mine.
Sorry.
"Dear Princess Celestia."
"It's hard to believe that two ponies who seem
to have so little in common could ever get along."
"But I found out that if you embrace
each others differences..."
"...you just might be surpriced to
discover a way to be friends after all."
So...
Who's up for another slumber party tomorrow night?
How about a week from Thursday?
Oh, how about two weeks from Saturday?
A month from now?
Hoof-biting action overload!
She was like a bright shooting star.
Flying higher and higher...
...and then Rainbow Dash
smooshed down SMOOSH...
...and right before she hit the ground,
SHOOM she pulled up WROOM!
And then she looped around and around like
WHOO WHOO WHOO WHOO
WHOO WHOO WHOO...!

Rainbow Dash!
Pinkie Pie? Not again...
Rainbow Dash!
Not now, Pinkie Pie!
But... but Rainbow Dash!
I'm in the middle of something!
But...
I said NOT NOW!
I was gonna tell you to
look out for that mountain.
Hi! I'm looking for Rainbow Dash.
Have you seen her?
Hi there! Have you seen Rainbow Dash?
...Okay, thanks anyway.
Twilight! Have you seen
Rainbow Dash anywhere?
Isn't she right up there?
Rainbow Dash!
That was close...
Hi!
Hi again!
I need a favor, Rainbow Dash.
Oh, forget it.
I toootally promise it
will be toootally fun!
Oookay.
Over to the right.
No no, a little-little left... Wait! Back to the right.
Now a little leftish while staying rightly.
STOP!
Maybe a few inches to the south!
Now a couple centimeters north...
Okay... one more smidgemeter to the...
PINKIE PIE!!!
I mean... perfect! Now wait for my signal.
Oh, Rainbow Dash. We startled
Spike into getting a hiccup!
Good one, Pinkie *hic* Pie *hic*! You're
always pulling a fast one *hic* on me.
Oh no! You're not hurt, are you?
Na*hic*ah... Don't be *hic* silly *hic*!
Dragons are *hic* fireproof!
Oh. Okay. Good.
I wish the same thing *hic*
were true of scrolls.
Have you ever seen anything more hilarious?
I can think of one thing.
I didn't take you for a prankster, Pinkie Pie.
Are you *hic* kidding?! *hic* I LOVE
to pull pranks! It's all *hic* in good fun.
And Pinkie Pie lo*hic*oves
to have *hic* fun! *hic*
You know, Pinkie Pie? You're
not as annoying as I thought!
You wanna hang out?
That'd be... *HIC* I'd really... *HIC* When do...
*HIC* I mean... *HIC* Where would you...
A simple nod will do.
Is she even home?
I don't know... There she goes...
There she is!
Land sakes!
Is someone over there? Who're we gonna
squirt, who're we gonna squirt?
Fluttershy.
WHAT?
Nononononono...! We can't prank
Fluttershy, I mean, she's so sensitive.
It'll hurt her feelings.
Even the most harmless prank.
Yeah, you're right.
Huh. We need another victim,
who's made of tougher stuff.
So... who's it gonna be?
Oh! I've got someone in mind.
The toughest around.
Oh, awesome! Who? Who? Do I know them?
Oh yes! You're very close.
Good one, Pinkie Pie!
Rise and shine, Rainbow Dash! It's a brand
new day and we got a lot of pranking to...
Morning, Pink!
Gilda, this is my gal pal Pinkie Pie.
Hey. Whazzup?
Pinkie, this is my griffon friend Gilda.
What's a griffon?
She's half-eagle, half-lion.
And ALL AWESOME!
Gilda's my best pal from my days
at the Junior Speedsters flight camp.
Hey, remember the chant?
Sure. They made us recite it every morning.
I'll never get that lame thing outta my head.
Sooo...
Only for you, Dash.
Junior Speedsters are our lives.
Skybound soars and daring dives
Junior Speedsters, it's our quest
To someday be the very best!
Oh, that was awesome! And it gave
me a great idea for a prank!
Gilda, you game?
Huh. Well, I groove on a good prank
as much as the next griffon.
But Dash! You promised me we'd get
a flying session in this morning.
Yeah... Um... Well... Pinkie Pie,
you don't mind, do you?
Gilda just got here.
We'll catch up with you later!
Oh! Um... Sure, no problem!
Have fun, you guys! I'll...
just catch up with you...
...later.
Wow! That was sweet! Just like old times.
Yeah! Only faster. So now what?
Hey there...!
Huh?
...it's later...!
...and I caught up...!
Pinkie Pie, you are so random!
Hey Dash! Think you got enough gas
left to beat me to that cloud?
A race? You are so on!
One... two... three... GO!
Hey...!
I win!
As if! I won, dude!
No way!
Yes way!
Oh, come on! I was way ahead of you!
Wow, guys, that was really cool!
But I think Rainbow Dash beat you
by a teeny-weeny itty-bitty hair.
Or a teeny-weeny itty-bitty feather.
See? Good thing, Pinkie Pie's
here to keep you honest, G.
Okay, Dash! Last one to that cloud
up there is an oily dragon egg.
GO!
I think the high altitude is making you dizzy.
Wait! Guys!
Wow! You guys almost got
away from me that time.
So Dash. Got any new moves in your
tricktionary or are you 100% old school?
New moves? Hah! Sit back, G.,
this is gonna take a while.
Hey, Pinkie. Come 'ere.
Yeah?
Don't you know how to take
"get lost" for an answer?
Dash doesn't need to hang with
a dweeb like you now when I'm around.
You're dorkin' up the skies, Stinkie Pie.
So make like a bee and BUZZ OFF!!!
Try matching that!
Hey! Where's Pinkie Pie and
her crazy contraption?
Eh... She left. Something about
being as busy as a bee.
So, Pinkie Pie, are you sure that this
friend of Rainbow Dash is really so mean?
Um... Yeah! She keeps stealing
Rainbow Dash away...
...she popped my balloons and
she told me to buzz off!
I've never met a griffon this mean.
Or actually, I've never met a griffon at all.
But I bet if I had, she wouldn't
be as mean and grumpy as Gilda!
You know what I think, Pinkie Pie?
Well, I think... you're jealous.
Jealous?!
Green with envy. Well,
in your case pink with envy.
Well, yes. Jealous.
Listen, Pinkie, I don't wanna upset you...
...but just because Rainbow Dash has
another friend doesn't make Gilda a grump.
I mean, perhaps it's you, Pinkie,
who needs to improve her attitude.
Improve MY attitude?!
But I... It's Gilda that...
Are you serio... ARGH!
Maybe Twilight is right. Maybe Gilda
isn't a big mean grumpy mean meanypants.
Maybe I'm just a big jealous
judgmental jealous jealousypants.
That was sweet!
Uh. I gotta take care of a few weather
jobs around here. Shouldn't take long.
Just hang out in town and I'll come find ya.
That's cool, I guess. I'm gonna go chow down.
Later!
A rattler! A rattler!
Run for the hills! Everybody protect yourselves!
This stuff ain't fresh, dude!
Aw, poor Granny Smith! She didn't know
it was a joke! How mean!
No, no! I can't misjudge her!
It *was* kind of a funny prank.
...I guess.
I *did* misjudge her! She's not only
a meanie meanpants! She's also a thief!
Nonononono... She might get it back!
It's just a joke!
All right, little one. This way. This way.
Mama Duck, you're free and clear.
Hey!
Please excuse me.
I'm walking here!
Oh... Um... I'm sorry.
I... I was just trying...
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
Why don't you just watch
where you're going, stupid?
B... but... I... I...
Please. All these lame ponies are
driving me buggy. I gotta bail.
She's a grump AND a thief AND a bully!
The meanest kind of mean meanypants there is!
I can take it, but no one
treats Fluttershy like that!
NO! ONE!
This calls for extreme measure. Pinkie Pie style!
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!
Who's this Gilda I've heard nothin' about?
I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash.
A griffon. So rare...
You've met Gilda, right? What's she like?
Oh! Um... Well...
I'll tell you later, Twilight.
Welcome! Welcome!
Um... Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda...
Um... Do you really think
it's a good idea? I mean...
Don't worry your pretty little
head about mean old Gilda.
Your auntie Pinkie Pie's
got it all taken care of.
I'm a year older than you.
GILDA!
I'm so honored, to throw you
my signature Pinkie Pie party!
And I really, truly, sincerely hope you
feel welcome here among all of us ponyfolk.
Oh, Pinkie Pie! The old hoofshake buzzer!
You are a scream!
Yeah... Good one, Pinkie Pie!
Come on, G. I'll introduce you
to some of my other friends.
Right behind you, Dash!
I know what you're up to.
Great!
I know what you're planning.
Well, I hope so! This wasn't
supposed to be a surprise party.
I mean, I've got my eye on you.
And I got my eye on you!
Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda,
a long time dear friend of Rainbow Dash.
Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville.
Please, help yourself.
Banana lemon drops. Don't mind if I do.
HOT!
G.! The punch!
Well, whaddya know?
Pepper in the vanilla lemon drop and
the punch served in a dribble glass!
HA! Priceless! Priceless!
Yeah! Hilarious!
Hey, G.! Look! Presents!
Spittin' snakes. Somepony pulled
that prank on me last month.
Ha ha. I bet I know who THAT was.
You do?
Cake time, everypony!
Hey! Can I blow the candles?
Why don't we let Gilda blow the candles, Spike?
She is a guest of honor after all.
Exactly!
Relighting birthday candles,
I love that prank! What a classic!
Now I wonder who could have done that.
Yeah, I wonder.
Who cares? This cake is amazing!
Spike!
What? It's great. Try some.
Hey, G.! You're not upset about
some silly candles, are you?
No way, Dash! Like I said,
I'm down with a good prank.
Come on then. Let's have some cake.
Hey! I'm watching you! Like a hawk.
Why? Can't you watch me like a griffon?
Hey y'all! It's Pin the Tail on the Pony!
Let's play!
Oh, my favorite game! Can I go first?
Can I have the purple tail?
Well, I am the guest of honor.
And I'll have the purple tail.
Yeah! Gilda should definitely go first!
Let's get you blindfolded.
Hey...! Wha... What are you doing?!
We're spinning you around and around and
then you can pin the tail on the pony.
Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail!
"Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail."
Huh. Yeah, right.
This is another prank, isn't it?
I'm going this way.
Wait! The poster is this...
Uh... Gilda? You pinned the tail
on the wrong end.
This is your idea of a good time?!
I've never a lamer bunch
of dweebs in all my life!
And Pinkie Pie, you!
You are Queen Lame-o
with your weak little party pranks.
Did you really think you can
make me lose my cool?
Well, Dash and I have ten times as much
cool as the rest of you put together!
Come on, Dash!
We're bailing on this pathetic scene.
Come on, Rainbow Dash!
we're leaving!
You know, Gilda? I was the one who set up
all those "weak pranks" at this party.
What?!
So I guess, *I'm* Queen Lame-o.
Come on, Dash! You're joshing me!
They weren't all meant for you specifically.
It was just dumb luck that you set them all off.
I should have known!
That dribbled cup had
Rainbow Dash written all over it.
No way. It was Pinkie Pie!
She set up this party to trick me up.
To make a fool of me!
Me? I threw this party to improve your attitude.
I thought a good party might
turn that frown upside down.
And you sure didn't need
any help making fool of yourself.
You know, this is not how I thought my
old friend would treat my new friends.
If being cool all you care about...
...maybe you should go find some
new cool friends someplace else.
Yeah? Well, you... you...
You are such a... a flip-flop!
Cool one minute and lame the next.
When you decide not to be
lame anymore, give me a call.
Not cool.
Wow. Talk about a party pooper.
I'm sorry, everypony, for bringing Gilda here.
I didn't know how rude she was.
And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry she ruined
that awesome party you put on for her.
Hey! If you wanna hang out with party
poopers, that's your business.
I'd rather hang out with you.
No hard feelings?
No hard feelings.
Hey, Pinkie. Sorry I accused you
of misjudging Gilda.
Looks like I'm the one who misjudged you.
It's okay, Twilight. Even you can't be
a super smart smarty smartpants all the time.
Come on, everypony! There's still
a whole lot of party to finish!
"Dearest Princess Celestia..."
"Today I learned that it's hard
to accept when somepony you like..."
"...wants to spend time with
somepony, who's not so nice."
"Though it's impossible to control
who your friends hang out with..."
"...it is possible to control your own behavior."
"Just continue to be a good friend."
"In the end the difference between a false friend
and one who is true will surely come to light."
"Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."
"Dear Twilight Sparkle,
my most faithful student..."
Oh! Wrong ink.
﻿2
Thank you, little squirrel.
But remember, these flowers
are for Princess Celestia.
Only the prettiest ones will do.
Hellooo, little guy.
I've never seen anything like you before.
Oh! Are you hungry?
Here you go.
I guess you *were* hungry.
You're the cuuutest thing ever!
I can't wait to show you to my friends.
Oh! Hurry up, Spike!
This place isn't gonna clean itself!
It also didn't mess itself up.
Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!
I thought this was just an unofficial, casual visit.
There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty!
I want this place to be spotless.
And you've barely made a dent in the clutter!
Maybe you should...
start reading them... one at a time!
Everything's got to be perfect.
No time for fooling around!
You know, this would be an awful lot easier...
...if there weren't two of us here
getting under each other's feet.
Great idea. You clean, I'll go see how
everyone else's preparations are coming.
Or maybe I should...?
What happened to the rest of her name?
We couldn't fit it all in.
You can't hang a banner that says
"Welcome Princess Celest".
Take it down and try again.
That looks perfect. Keep up the good work.
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cake.
How's the banquet coming?
It would be coming a little better if...
Pinkie! What are you doing?!
Those sweets are supposed to be for the Princess!
I-I know. That's why I'm tasting them.
Somepony needs to make sure that everything
is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue.
And I, Pinkie Pie, declare that
these treats are fit for a king!
Or a queen! Or a princess!
Twilight! Pinkie! You won't believe...!
Oh. I'm sorry. Uh... Am I interrupting?
No, not at all. Come on in
and make yourself at home.
What's going on, Fluttershy?
You won't believe what I found
at the edge of the Everfree Forest.
Come on out, little guy. It's okay.
Three?
They're amazing! What are they?
I'm not sure. I'm also not sure
where these other two came from.
I'll take one off your hoofs.
I've never seen anything so...
...ADORABLE!
Besides, it'll be nice to have
a companion for Spike...
...so won't bother me so much
while I'm studying.
Pinkie, do you want the other one?
Ugh! A parasprite? Are you kidding?
Ugh?
A para-what?
How could you not like...
Now I gotta go find a trombone!
A what?
A trombone. You know...
Typical Pinkie.
[Stand still, Rainbow Dash.]
I can't! I need to fly!
This is way too boring for me.
Do you want to look nice
for Princess Celestia or not?
Wow! Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous!
Hm, thank you, Twilight.
Nice to know *someone* appreciates my talents.
Sooo boooring.
Huh?
What's that sound, Twilight?
Wow! What are they?
where did they come from?
I only had one a minute ago.
Uh, I'll take one!
Me too. Oh, they're perfect!
Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?
Girls! Hello! This is important!
Durgh! Thanks a lot!
Oh, the decorations... the banquet...
I really hope everything comes
together in time for tomorrow.
What's there to worry about?
Spike!
Wake up! What happened?!
What's going on?
Where did they come from?
I don't know. The little guy got hungry
in the night, so I gave him a snack, but...
...I have no idea where these others came from.
Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work!
The Princess will be here in a few hours!
Spike! Help me round up these little guys!
What does it... look like I'm... doing?
I know, I know. "Stop fooling around."
Get off me!
Not only are you adorable...
...but you're also quite useful.
Oh! Are you okay?
Eeew!
Gross, gross, gross!
No creature that behaves so revoltingly
is allowed in my boutique!
Look, Rarity! Applejack lent me a harmonica!
Isn't that great?
And not a moment too soon.
Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now.
And I'm not?! You know how many
more instruments I've gotta find?
A lot! That's how many.
Now if we split the list between us,
we might just make it in time.
Please, Pinkie! I don't have time
for some silly scavenger hunt.
I've got a real problem.
You've got a real problem, all right.
And a banjo is the only answer!
I see we've having the same problem.
Get out!
Fluttershy knows everything about animals.
I'm sure she can tell us how to
stop them from multiplying.
Or not.
Do something, Fluttershy! Can't you control them?
I've tried everything I know.
I've tried begging and pleading
and beseeching and asking politely and...
If we can't get them under control
before the Princess arrives...
...it'll be a total disaster!
EEEW!
If you ask me, it's already a total disaster!
Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy!
But I still can't figure why ya need so many.
Hey!
What do we do?
I got it!
Nopony can herd like Applejack!
Yeah! We can drive them back into the forest!
I'll rustle 'em up, but I need
everypony's help to do it.
Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there.
I'll herd the little critters
straight at ya like a funnel.
Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy
stay on top of 'em.
Don't let 'em fly away.
Aye, aye!
YEEHAW!
All right, y'all. Here goes nothin'!
Look out, Rarity!
That one's fixin' on gettin' away!
Keep a lean on 'em, Rainbow Dash!
Hold on, girls. We're almost there!
Pinkie!
Twilight! We don't have much time.
You're telling me? The Princess
could arrive at any moment.
Exactly! That's why I need you, girls,
to drop what you're doing...
...and help me find some maracas!
Maracas?
Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas!
You're right!
Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal.
Follow me!
follow me!
Pinkie Pie...
...you are so random.
Ugh, you are also stubborn!
Forget her, ladies.
Focus! Head 'em up and move 'em out.
Alright!
Ouch.
We did it! Nice work, Applejack.
Couldn't have done it without y'all.
Now let's get back and clean up the mess
they made before the Princess arrives.
Okay. Everyone knows what to do, right?
We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time.
Where did *they* come from?
Well... I may have kept just one.
I couldn't help myself. They're just...
...so cute.
We don't have time to
keep rounding up these things!
What do we do now?
We call in the weather patrol!
Time to take out the adorable trash.
YAAA!!!
Way to go, Rainbow Dash!
Looks like our problems are solved.
They will be with these cymbals!
Hey! Gimme those back!
I can't hold it! She's breaking up!
Pinkie Pie! What have you done!?
I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals,
that's what I've done!
Will you forget about your
silly instruments for one second?
You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville!
Me?! Ruin?!
I'm not the ruiner. I am the ruinee!
Or is it ruiness?
Ruinette?
Come on, girls!
There's no reasonin' with that one.
She's a few apples short of a bushel.
Hey! I'm trying to tell you all
that the ruining is on the other hoof!
If you just slowed down and LISTENED TO ME...!
What do we do?
They're eating all the food in town.
My apples!
We've gotta do something!
I got it! I'll cast a spell to make them
stop eating all the food.
Look! Tambourines! If you could all just...!
Hey! It worked. They're not
eating the food anymore.
Oh no. If they get inside my store...
EVERYPONY FOR HERSELF!
MY OUTFITS!
Go on! Shoo! Get out! Naughty, naughty!
I'll save you!
No woodland creature's gonna
eat the Apple family's crop!
Brace yourself, y'all!
Here they come!
Didn't see that one comin'.
Help!
They're eating the words!
Help.
Have you gone mad?
Zecora! These little guys
are devouring Ponyville!
And the Princess is on her way!
Can you help us? Please?
Oh, monster of so little size.
Is that a parasprite before my eyes?
I don't know! Is it?
Tales of crops and harvests consumed.
If these creatures are in Ponyville...
...you're doomed.
Oh no! Here she comes!
Okay. Here's the plan.
Rainbow Dash, you distract them.
Good! Everyone else, we need to build
an exact copy of Ponyville right over there.
We've got less than a minute.
Zecora was right. We're doomed.
Oh no. The Princess's procession
is here. It's all over!
Pinkie? We're in the middle of a crisis here.
This is no time for your...
...nonsense?
Look!
Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil!
Hello, Princess!
So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends.
So... How was the trip? Hit much traffic?
What is this?
These creatures are adorable!
They're not *that* adorable.
I'm terribly honored that you
and the good citizens of Ponyville...
...have organized a parade in honor of my visit.
Parade? Oh! Yes! The parade!
Unfortunately that visit is going to
have to wait for another time.
I'm afraid an emergency has
come up in Fillydelphia.
Apparently there's been some sort of infestation.
An... infestation?
Yes. A swarm of incredibly bothersome
creatures has invaded the poor town.
I'm sorry, Twilight, to have to
put you all through so much trouble.
Trouble? Oh... What trouble?
Before I have to go...
...would you care to give me your latest report
on the magic of friendship in person?
My... report?
Haven't you learned anything about friendship?
Actually, I have.
I've learned that sometimes the solution to your
problems can come from where you least expect it.
It's a good idea to stop and listen to
your friends' opinions and perspectives.
Even when they don't always seem to make sense.
I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle.
And I'm very impressed with your friends as well.
It sounds like you're all learning
so much from each other.
Thank you, Princess.
Hey! What happened to the Princess?
Emergency in Fillydelphia.
Some sort of "infestation".
Oh no! Have they got parasprites too?!
Well, have tuba, will travel.
I think the Princess can handle it.
So you knew what those critters
were all along, huh, Pinkie Pie?
Well, duh! Why do you think I was so frantic
to get my hooves on all these instruments?
I tried to tell you.
We know, Pinkie Pie.
And we're sorry we didn't listen.
You're a great friend.
Even if we don't always understand you.
Thanks, guys. You're all great friends too.
Even when I don't understand me.
You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia!
And more importantly, you saved Ponyville!
Or not.
Perfect!
Coming!
Welcome to Carousel Boutique...
...where every garment is
chic, unique and magnifique.
Sapphire Shores! The Pony of Pop!
Good afternoon, Miss Raritee!
You... you know my name?
Well, of course I do, darling.
I make it a point to know all
of the up-and-coming designers...
...and Clothes Horse magazine
simply raved about you.
Oh my stars. If I'm dreaming, do not wake me up.
How may I help you, Miss Shores?
Oh please, call me Sapphire.
How may I help you, Sapphire?
Well, as I'm sure you know, I'll be touring
all of Equestria with my latest concert...
SAPPHIRE SHORES ZIGFILLY FOLLIES!
...so I need to look...
SEEENSATIONAL!
OW!
I have just what you need.
Sapphire Shores, prepare yourself for the
pièce de résistance de la haute couture.
I used every last diamond
I found on this one garment.
And it is spectacular!
I'll take it.
Really?
Oh yes, and five more,
each done up in a different jewel.
Beg pardon?
Costume changes.
Yes, I do have that effect on ponies.
Oh my gosh! Sapphire Shores! The Pony of Pop!
She is awesome!
I mean, she's gorgeous, talented and...
...and not even half the pony you are.
I mean, you're ten times more
gorgeous and talented and...
Spike, a lady is never jealous.
Of course not. But were you
totally flipping out or what?
Ladies do not "flip out", Spike.
However, I was quite in awe.
Oh, I need to find more jewels than ever
before to decorate her costumes.
Oh, aha!
Did you find some?
Yes, Spike! Right there!
You look so delicious...
Spike!
I promised I'll give you gems to snack on.
But we need to collect more first or I'll never
be able to make these outfits for Sapphire.
I will miss you, my sweets.
Come along, Spike. We have many jewels to find.
At your service, my lady.
Spike!
You've been very patient today, Spike.
And for that you'll get the finest reward.
This is from me to you.
Is something wrong, Spike?
No. It's perfect.
Ooh, bring the cart, Spike.
There are more over here.
For me.
From Rarity.
Yesss, gemsss. Gemsss!
Our preciousss gemsss!
He is the gem hunter.
With him we can have all those gems.
And more!
Let's get the dragon.
Spike! Where are you?
What? Who is that?
You know, it's terrible to keep a lady waiting.
Coming!
I think we're really going
to strike gold this time.
So to speak.
Jackpot!
Oh, it's not the dragon we want. It's the pony!
The pony...
Well, Spike, I think that's all we can do for today.
And these will certainly get me well
on my way with Sapphire's outfits.
Why don't we start headi... Oh!
What's this? Another jewel!
Oh, strange. It's in the trees.
Good day, gentle... uh, fellow.
I am Rarity and this is my friend Spike.
And you are...?
A diamond dog.
Oh really? Oh well, that explains
your fine taste in jewelry.
I mean I-I-I know that diamonds
are a girl's best friend...
...and now I know that they're a
dog's best friend too, ha ha ha.
So, um... you're out hunting for gems as well?
Yes. We hunt.
Uh... we?
We hunt for gems.
But you are a better hunter. So now we hunt...
...for you!
Run, Rarity! Run!
Spike! Come on! Hurry!
Gotcha!
Got him, Rarity! I got him!
Ha ha! Nope!
Sorry, scaly one.
Wait! Rarity?
Unhand me this instant, you ruffians. Stop!
Put me down, you scum! You rough...!
Rarity!
Spike!
Ah, dirt!
AAAAAH, SPIKE!
Which... what... where...
SAVE ME...!
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Spike, can you breathe now?
Yes... I think so.
Good. Now tell us what you know.
Yeah. Cause all you said earlier was...
Rarity... woods... jewels... dogs...
hole... taken... SAVE HER!
Not a whole lot to go on there, Sport.
Sorry. Rarity and I were in the woods looking
for jewels when these creepy guys showed up.
Creepy guys?
They called themselves the diamond dogs.
They grabbed Rarity and disappeared
down a hole in the ground.
Well, that sounds mighty easy. Just take us
to that their hole and we'll save Rarity.
Holy Moly, that's a lotta holeys.
Come on, girls! Let's get started.
Hello!
Quick! We gotta get down one
before they're all filled up.
Oh! Oh my. Oh! Oh!
We can't muscle through it!
We'll see about that.
Huh. Heavens to Betsy.
Now I'm used to pickin' myself up
and dustin' myself off...
...but Rarity won't even touch
mud 'less it's imported.
Oh, Rarity...
Oh, woe is me! What ever shall I do?
Ah! Dirt, dirt!
Get away, dirt! Oh! Make it stop! Make it stop!
Ah! Filthy, disgusting dirt.
It stings, it burns.
Help! Oh, somepony save me, SAVE ME!
We gotta save her.
But they blocked up all the holes.
Don't mean we can't dig 'em out. Come on!
Get 'em!
Come on!
Oh, those scary monsters popping up everywhere.
Oh, poor Rarity must be terrified.
Oh...
Get me the baubles!
Get me the beads!
Get me the trinkets!
Where is the treasure?!
Poor Rarity. What are we gonna do?
I got it!
I'll save you, my sweet!
Huh?
Spike, it is very noble of you...
Shhh!
...to sacrifice the gem Rarity gave you.
Oh, Lady Rarity. My damsel in distress.
I shall save you.
Show yourselves, dogs! You curse!
Hah. There you are, you mingy mutts.
Who are you calling mutts?
Unleash the hounds!
Now, where is Lady Rarity?
Spike! I knew you would save me!
Nothing could stop me, my lady.
Oh, Spike. You are my hero.
Hoho there, lover boy.
Whoa!
Whoa whoa whoawhoawhoa...
I got a bite! I got a bite!
Hold on there, little fella.
Applejack!
Twilight!
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness...
Wait for me! Wheee!
Whee!
Ha ha, it worked! We're in!
Now we can finally save Rarity!
Um...
Which way do we go?
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
All these tunnels...
How are we ever gonna find Rarity?
Guess we're just gonna have to
start going down them one by one.
That could take forever!
There's gotta be way to narrow it down.
I know!
I bet they've taken Rarity
down the tunnel with the most gems.
But Spike, Rarity is the only one
who knows how to find gems.
No, Twilight. You can!
You can copy Rarity's gemfinding spell.
Oh my gosh! You're right!
Rarity showed me how she did it
a while back. If I can just remember...
That's it.
You did it, Twilight. Come on!
We're coming, Rarity.
We'll save you. Just hold on!
Oh please, diamond dogs. Please let me go.
No!
You're our precious little pony.
For ever!
But what ever do you want from me?
Gemsss!
Yes! The gems. The jewels.
Find them! Find them all!
Oh! Is that all?
There. A lovely pocket of jewels are right there.
Now, would you be so kind as to show me the exit?
Good!
Now, dig them up, pony.
What? But you said you wanted me to *find* the gems.
Yes! Find and then dig.
Dig?
Yes. Dig.
What are you doing? We said dig!
Forgive me but prior to you so rudely
dragging me into your dirt pit...
...I had a pony pedi and I am not about to chip
a hoof because you dislike my style of digging.
Oh, for goodness.
Fine! Just stop. Stop!
Dig, dogs! Dig! And fast.
She won't dig, she pulls.
I beg your pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing?
Others will dig. You will haul the wagon.
Prrrecious pony pedi will be preserved.
Well, somebody certainly needs proper nail care.
When was the last time you two had a manicure?
You're scratching up my coat
with that jagged things.
Please be quiet!
Good heavens, what is that smell?
Smeeeeeell?
Ah, mystery solved. It's your breath.
Enough!
Search, pony!
Well, since you *insist*...
But I must say the working conditions
in here are simply dreadful.
Musty and damp, it's going to wreak havoc on my mane.
And this air is strictly suffocating.
And when I try to get a deep breath,
the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseating.
You look and smell like if you haven't bathed
in weeks. Have you never heard of soap?
You could all do with a good
round of soap and water.
Water, water, I'm terribly thirsty.
Could I please have some water?
Good gracious, I can't take this anymore.
BE QUIET, PONY!
And that's another thing. I would appreciate
if you stopped calling me "pony".
I am a lady and I wish to be addressed as such.
So you may call me "Miss" or
"Rarity" or "Miss Rarity"
Enough! Your whining! I-I-It hurts!
Whining? I am *not* whining. I am complaining.
Do you want to hear whining?
Thiiis iiis whiiining!
Oooh, this harness it too tiiight!
It's going to chafe. Can't you loosen it?
Oooh, it hurts and it's sooo ruuusty!
Why didn't you clean it first?
It's gonna leave a staaain!
And the wagon's getting heeeavy,
why do I have to pull it?!
Aaah! Make it stop!
Stop whining!
But I thought you wanted whiiining!
We'll do anything, pony!
Oh, uh, we'll do anything, "Miss Rarity".
Anything?
This water is hardly sparkling.
But I suppose it will have to do.
Wait! Why are we doing this?
To stop the awful noises from
the pony's mouth, remember?
Yes, yes, I know.
This is ridiculous! Letting a pony order us around.
What are we? Mice or dogs?
Mi... dogs?
Dogs do not pull. Ponies pull.
Let her make the awful noises.
Huh? What are you doing?
Hey, you spilled my drink.
Not sooo tiiight!
Ha! Make the noises all you want.
But move while you make them.
Hyah, mule!
Did you just call me a... mule?
Mules are ugly. Are you saying that I too am ugly?
What are *these* noises?
HE CALLED ME UGLY!
No! Mule! I said mule!
An old ugly mule! And it's true!
Just look at me. I used to be beautiful,
but... but... nooow...
No, no! You're still beautiful, po... uh, Miss Rarity.
You're just saying that!
No, you're still pretty and... and...
Oh, uh uh, nice. Yeah.
I don't believe you! You never liked me!
I have just about enough of this.
We're getting close. I can feel it.
It's coming from down here! Come on!
She must be in there. Let's go!
More workhorses.
Ho, doggies. If you can take
this bull by the horns...
...you better be ready for a ride.
Come on, ponies! Kick 'em up, kick 'em out.
Buck 'em up, buck 'em down.
Yeehaw!
Get along, little doggies!
I'm coming for you, my lady.
Hi-ho, Twilight! Away!
And just what do you think you're doing?
Please, Twilight. Just give me this.
Fine.
Lady Rarity, I'm here to save you!
Excuse me?
So picky.
And critical.
She won't stop talking.
And crying.
We, uh, give her back. Yes.
Rarity! You're safe!
Why, yes. Hello, girls.
You are just in time to assist me.
Assist you with what?
With those.
You're letting us leave with all these... jewels?
Yes. Take them. And her with them.
Please!
I can't believe you got all these gems!
Heh. I can't believe you tricked all those dogs.
Just because I'm a lady doesn't mean
I cannot handle myself in a sticky situation.
I had them wrapped around my hoof the entire time.
I can't wait to write to Princess Celestia
to tell her what you taught me today.
Me? What did I teach you?
Just because somepony is ladylike
doesn't make her weak.
In fact, by using her wits...
...a seemingly defenseless pony can be
the one who outsmarts and outshines them all.
"Outshines" is right.
Now you have enough gems
to cover Sapphire Shores's costumes.
Not if you eat them all, Spike.
Wow, what a gorgeous day!
Rainbow Dash must've gotten up early for
once and cleared all the clouds away.
I bet all of Ponyville is gonna be out enjoying the sunshine.
...What? Where IS everypony?
Is it some sort of pony holiday?
Not that I know of.
Not more than usual.
Is it...ZOMBIES?!
Uh...not very likely.
Spike!
Come here!
Come! Here!
HURRY!
Before she GETS you!
Spike! There are NO zombie ponies!
Pinkie! What are you doing here alone in the dark?
I'm not alone in the dark.
Okay then, what are you ALL doing here in the dark?
Big adventure
Tons of fun
A beautiful heart
Faithful and strong
Sharing kindness
It's an easy feat
And magic makes it all complete, yeah
Did you see her, Twilight? Did you see Zecora?
And then a bunch of you flip out for no good reason!
No good reason?!
You call protectin' yer kin "no good reason?"
Why, as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town,
she started SHAKIN' in her little horseshoes!
So I swept her up and brought 'er here.
I walked here myself!
For safekeepin'!
Not from that creepy Zecora.
She's mysterious.
Sinister.
Will you cut that out?!
Just LOOK at those stripes! So garish!
She's a zebra.
A WHAT?!
A zebra! And her stripes aren't a fashion choice, Rarity.
They're what she was born with.
Born WHERE?! I've never seen a pony
Well, she's probably not from here.
And she's not a pony.
My book says zebras come from a faraway land.
But I've never seen her in Ponyville.
Where does she live?
That's just it. She lives in...THE EVERFREE FOREST!
SPIKE!
The Everfree Forest just ain't natural.
The plants grow.
Animals care for themselves...
And the clouds move...
ALL ON THEIR OWN!
And that wicked enchantress Zecora lives there doing her evil...uh...STUFF!
She's so evil, I even wrote a song about her!
She does evil dances
And if you look deep in her eyes
She'll put you in trances
Then what will she do?
She'll mix up an evil brew
And she'll gobble you up
In a big tasty stew
Wow. Catchy.
It's a work in progress.
This is all just a bunch of gossip and rumors.
Now tell me, what exactly have you SEEN Zecora do?
Well...once a month, she comes into Ponyville.
Then she lurks by the stores.
And then, she digs at the ground...
Maybe she comes to town to visit.
Yeah! Maybe she's just tryin' t'be neighborly!
And maybe she's not LURKING by the stores.
Maybe she's GOING to them, lurk-free,
to do some shopping?
Yeah! Everypony likes to shop!
You know what I think?
APPLEBLOOM!
Hush and let the big ponies talk!
What about digging at the ground?
You gotta admit THAT'S weird.
What if she's digging for innocent creatures?
I'm
sure there's an explanation for everything Zecora does.
And if ANYPONY here were actually brave enough to approach her,
she would find out the truth.
Well, I'm brave enough! I'm gonna find out myself!

the highest video and audio quality!
You ponies are being RIDICULOUS!
Yeah, but I heard it's the EVIL way she eats hay.
The door's open!
She went outside?!
And Zecora's still out there!
Spike, you stay here in case Applebloom comes back.
Will do!
Applebloom?!
You get back here right now!
folk! Those leaves of blue are not a joke!
You keep yer creepy mumbo-jumbo to yerself, ya hear?!
Yeah, back atcha, Zecora!
You and your...lame...curse are the ones who better beware!
And YOU! Why couldn't you just listen to your big sister?!
Who knows what kinda nasty curse Zecora coulda just put on you?!
Just like in my song!
You guys! There's no such thing as curses!
Well, that's interesting to hear, coming from Miss Magic-pants herself.
My magic - REAL magic - comes from within.
It's a skill you're born with.
Curses are artificial. Fake magic.
It's conjured with potions and incantations.
All smoke and mirrors meant to scare.
But curses have no real power. They're just an old pony tale.
Just you wait, Twilight. You're gonna learn
that some pony tales really are true.
does evil dances
Beware! BEWARE!
she will put you in trances
Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!
Wicked,
A curse...
Just you wait, Twilight. Some pony tales
really are true.
a big tasty stew
Curses-shmurses.
No, no, no, no, NO!
None of these books have a cure!
An illness? An allergy?!
A curse!
I said a real reason.
Something that points to something real.
How about this one?
Spike, the word "supernatural" refers to things like ghosts, and spirits, and zombies,
which are as make-believe as curses.
This book is just a bunch of hooey!
But what if you're wrong, Twilight?
What if this really is a-
A purse?! How could it be a purse?
Pinkie! What happened?!
Spthe thputh a curth on me!
Augh! Say it, don't spray it, Pinkie!
Ow!
I'm afraid I have to agree.
but I told ya so!
it's a curse, I tells ya!
But...Fluttershy...seems just fine.
Yes, there doesn't seem to be a THING wrong with her.
Fluttershy? Are you okay?
Is there something wrong with you?
...Would you care to tell us?
So...you're NOT gonna tell us?
Yes you're not, or yes you will?
Good gravy, girl! What's wrong with you?!
Hairity [Rarity],
Rainbow Crash [Dash],
Spittie [Pinkie] Pie,
Appleteeny [appletini],
Flutterguy [Fluttershy],
and...uh...
I got nothin'.
"Twilight Sparkle." I mean, seriously. I can't even work with that.
Now start looking for more books so I can find a cure!
I think we'll find a cure to this curse at Zecora's place!
It's not a curse!
I agree with Dash!
We'll go to Zecora's and force her to remove this hex!
It's not a hex either!
This is all my fault.
If I hadn't followed Zecora in the first place, none of this would've happened.
I just gotta fix this.
Now, where does she think she's goin' this time?!
I don't care what you say, Twilight!
It's time to pony up and confront Zecora!
Come on, girls! Are you with me?!
I ampth!
And I, as well.
Uh, I don't know. Seems awfully dangerous.
How 'bout you, Applejack? ...Applejack?
She'thp gonthe!
Or...sat on her?
Rarity's hair!
Nopeth.
Applebloom is gone too!
I bet they went after Zecora!
Well, we better go find them.
Come on, girls, let's go.
Oh, this is SO unseemly!
Oopsie! Sorry.
OW!
Uh, Spike? Are you coming?
Nope! Uh...gotta stay here and look for a cure.
Stop right there!
Turn around right now, missy!
No?! You can't ignore a direct order from your big sister!
but I'M the big sister now.
Applebloom! You come back here right this instant!
Come on, girls! We've got to get to Zecora's!
Hurry!
Hey! Wait for me!
Rainbow! Thank Celestia!
There's no time to lose!
I need to get to Zecora's, pronto!
Giddyap, pony!
Ex-CUSE me?
What the?!
No, Rainbow Dash! Other way!
Thish plashp looksh horriplesh!
Oh my. That place really DOES look horrible!
Nice decorations.
If you like CREEPY!
She shtole my sthong!
She stole your song?
Oh, Pinkie. That doesn't sound anything like your song.
She does evil dances
And if you look deep in her eyes
She will put you in trances
Then what will she do?
She'll mix up an evil brew
Then she'll gobble you up
In a big tasty stew
Soooo...watch out.
YOU saw those terrible things! NOW do you believe us, Twilight?!
Scary looking masks, confusing incantations, and a great big bubbling cauldron?
Or...what if Zecora's just making soup?
Now, where is that little Applebloom?
What if she's making Applebloom Soup?
I'm comin' for ya, Applebloom!
(door crashes open, Zecora speaks native language frantically, Rainbow
Dash crashes into various things)
Whoa there!
Easy, Rainbow Crash!
Ponies! What is this you-
gone and spilled my precious brew!
We're onto you, Zecora!
I didn't want to believe you cursed us, but the evidence is overwhelming!
You made me look ridiculous!
You made me SOUND ridiculous!
How dare you?!
then rudely accuse me of being a jerk?!
You put this curse on us, now you're gonna UNcurse us!
road. Your actions will make my anger explode!
Zecora! I think I
found all the things ya asked for.
What in Ponyville is goin' on here?!
You're okay!
Why wouldn't I be?
Because Zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us
and was going to cook you up into soup!
Oh, Twilight!
Did those silly fillies finally get in yer head?
Y'know there's no such thing as a curse!
there and tell me this isn't a curse!
It was a warning.
About that blue plant. It's called Poison Joke.
That plant is much like poison oak,
but its results are like a joke.
WHAT in the hay does that mean?
It means this plant does not breed wrath.
Instead, this plant just wants a laugh.
Will SOMEpony please talk normal?!
I think what she's saying is that when we ran
in to save Applebloom, we ran into the Poison Joke.
All our problems were just little jokes it played on us.
"LITTLE" jokes?!
Ok, fine. But what about the cauldron?
And the chanting?
And the creepy decor?
Treasures of the native land where I am
from. This one speaks 'hello', and this 'welcome'.
Not welcoming at all, if you ask me.
The words I chanted were from olden
times. Something you call a nursery rhyme.
But the cauldron...The Applebloom Soup?
Lookie here, Twilight!
That pot o'water wasn't for me!
It was for all these herbal ingredients!
The cure for Poison Joke is a simple old natural remedy!
You just gotta take a bubble bath!
books and couldn't find anything. What book has this natural remedy?
Here is the book, you see? Sad
that you lack it in your library.
didn't look inside because the title was so... Weird.
I had the answer the whole time, if
only I had bothered to look inside.
[chuckle] Maybe next time you will take a second
look, and not judge the cover of the book.
Zecora? Would you be kind enough to mix
up another batch of the herbal bath?
Mix it up I certainly will. Yet
I am missing an herb from Ponyville.
But whenever Zecora comes to town, all the shops are mysteriously closed!
Look, Rose! How awful!
The wicked enchantress has cursed them all!
The horror! The horror!
Daisy? We need to talk.
Never judge a book by its cover.
Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary.
But you have to look past that and learn who they are inside.
Real friends don't care what your cover is; It's
the contents of a pony that count.
And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever.
Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."
Miss Zecora. I would love to get the
recipe for this bath. It's simply luxurious!
I'm right here, li'l sis!
I ain't tiny no more!
Ooh. I have never felt so lovely in all my life!
Oh my gosh! I've never realized how horrible
it is to not be able to talk.
I mean I love talking so much and when I
couldn't talk 'cause my tongue was all 'ehhhh'.
It was the worst! Don't you agree, Fluttershy?
My Little Pony
My Little Pony, friends
Spike! Wake up! Wake up, wake up,
it's Winter Wrap Up Day!
Mommy...?
Winter Wrap Up!
You're not mommy!
Spike! The first day of spring is tomorrow!
So everypony in Ponyville needs to clean up
winter. Now help me get ready.
Clean up winter? Who cleans up winter?
Don't they just use magic to change
the seasons like we do in Canterlot?
No, Spike. Ponyville was
started by earth ponies...
...so for hundreds of years they've
never used magic to clean up winter.
It's traditional!
It's ridiculous!
No magic, pfuh...
Check.
Check.
Spike refusing to get up and
Check.
It's a good thing I'm so organized.
I'm ready! Bright and early!
Oh... Maybe a little too early.
Those must be the team vests Rarity designed.
Blue for the weather team...
...green for the plant team...
...and tan for the animal team.
I wonder which team vest I'll be wearing.
I'll take a blue vest.
The same color as my blanket.
Which I think I hear calling my name.
"Spike! Spike! Come to bed!"
Ugh... It's too early.
Thank you, everypony, for being
here bright and early.
We need every single pony's help to
wrap up winter and bring in spring.
Now, all of you have your vests and
have been assigned to your teams...
...so let's do even better than last year and
have the quickest Winter Wrap Up ever!
Oh, this is so exciting!
All right, everypony, find your team leader...
...and let's get galloping!
Oh gosh! Where should I go?
I'm not sure where I'd fit in.
What exactly does everypony do?
Three months of winter coolness
and awesome holidays.
We've kept our hoofsies warm at home,
time off from work to play.
But the food we've stored is runnin' out
and we can't grow in this cold.
And even though I love my boots,
this fashion's getting old.
The time has come to welcome spring
and all things warm and green,
But it's also time to say goodbye,
it's winter we must clean.
How can I help? I'm new, you'll see.
What does everypony do?
How do I fit in without magic?
I haven't got a clue.
Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Let's finish our holiday cheer!
Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Bringing home the southern birds,
a pegasus job begins.
And clearing all the gloomy skies
to let the sunshine in.
We move the clouds
and we melt the white snow.
When the sun comes up,
its warmth and beauty will glow!
Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Let's finish our holiday cheer!
Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Little critters hibernate
under the snow and ice.
We wake up all their sleepy heads
so quietly and nice.
We help them gather up their food,
fix their homes below.
We welcome back the southern birds,
so their families can grow!
Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Let's finish our holiday cheer!
Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!
No easy task to clear the ground,
plant our tiny seeds.
With proper care and sunshine,
everyone it feeds.
Apples, carrots, celery stalks,
colorful flowers too.
We must work so very hard.
It's just so much to do!
Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Let's finish our holiday cheer!
Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Now that I know what they all do,
I have to find my place.
And help with all of my heart,
tough task ahead I face.
How will I do without my magic,
help the earth pony way.
I wanna belong so I must
do my best today! Do my best today!
Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Let's finish our holiday cheer!
Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap Up!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Cause tomorrow spring is here!
Everypony belongs to a team.
What should I do? Where should I go?
All right, team! You're cleared for takeoff!
Rainbow Dash!
Oh, hey Twilight! What's up?
What are you doing?
Sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve
the birds that have flown south for the winter.
Oh! Can I help?
How about if I help clear out the clouds?
Um...
Right. No wings.
Sorry, Twilight.
Great! Now what do we do?
I don't know about you but I'm gonna be napping.
Come on, Spike! This is serious business!
Winter needs to be wrapped up.
And I'm determined to do my part!
Somehow.
Rarity, please tell me there's something...
anything I can help you with!
Well, how would you like to help create
Ponyville's finest birds' nests?
Birds' nests?
Why, yes! When the weather team guides
the birds back north for the spring...
...they'll need a place
to live and lay their eggs.
Wow, Rarity, that one's really beautiful!
Oh, why, thank you most sincerely.
Would you like to try your hoof at a nest?
Would I? Yes! Where do I begin?
Okay now. Uh... Take some of that straw and
hay over there and a little bit of branch.
Now weave them through there... Yes!
Uh... Take some ribbon, yes... oh uh n...
not there... oohhh... yes...
Tuck it in over there. Uh...
but be careful not to...
Oh no no, I... I guess that will do... Oh dear.
There!
It looks just like... yours. Oh my.
That nest needs to be condemned!
Oh, Spike. It's not so bad.
Maybe the birds can use it as a...
An outhouse?
Spike. It's just fine. It's just a little
rough aroung the edges.
Let me lend you a hoof.
Let's just untie this ribbon and if we take
out these sticks here, we'll shape this...
I think we lost her.
...and we need to weave the string in here...
Hellooo, Twilight!
Wow, Pinkie Pie, you're quite a skater.
Probably the best skater I've ever seen.
Thanks, Twilight! I've been doing this since I
was an itty-bitty little-wittle Twinkie-Pinkie!
This comes naturally.
Which is probably why they
designated me the lake scorer.
I cut lines in the lake with my skates.
That way, when the rest of the weather
team comes here to break the ice...
...it will be easy as pie!
How clever! When the thick ice begins
to melt, it will break along the lines.
Well, you sure have a lot of work ahead of you.
There's quite a few lakes in Ponyville.
Huh... Tell me about it!
Hey, Twilight! Wanna help me out?
Would I?
Come on, put on those skates over there.
I bet you'll be a natural too!
Okay.
Maybe on second thought...
What are you talking about?
You said you wanted to be helpful.
Now get out there!
Twilight! Steer! Steer!
Oh boy!
You ARE a natural, Twilight! Natural disaster!
Twilight, you did a great
job your first time around.
I'm sure my first time was just as wobbly
and bobbly and crasherrific as yours.
Really?
...No.
But did I make you feel better?
Yeah... I guess.
I bet you'll be super awesome at something
that keeps your hooves on the ground.
I know! Fluttershy could probably
use your help with the critters.
Well, I'm pretty good with little animals.
Yeah! I'll go help her!
It's... that way.
Wake up, little sleepy heads!
Hope you had some wonderful
dreams and restful hibernation.
But it's time to up now! Spring is coming!
Awww, how cute!
Aren't they? This is my
favorite task the whole season.
When I get to see all my
little animal friends again.
Uh... what's "hibernation"?
It's like a long sleep.
Long sleep?
Yes.
Wake up, little porcupines!
Animals often hibernate through the winter
to save their energy and eat less food.
I definitely like the idea of hibernation.
Uh... except for the "eat less food" part.
Oh, but just look at all these warrens and dens.
I'm worried that I won't be able to wake up
every animal before spring comes.
Well, I'll help, Fluttershy!
Oh, you will? Oh, that would be wonderful!
Okay!
Let's start there!
Hello! Wake up, little friends!
Wherever you are. Spring is coming!
I wonder which cute little
furry creatures I've awoken!
Aaa! Snakes! Snaaakes!
Good morning, friends!
All this Winter Wrap Up stuff
is a lot harder than it looks.
Right. Because there's no magic.
Why don't you just use magic,
Twilight, and get it done the right way?
No, Spike. I have to do it the traditional way.
Ponyville has never needed
magic to wrap up winter.
But they never had you here before, either.
Think of how much quicker they could
wrap up winter with your magic!
No, no, NO! I'm gonna find some other
way that I can help out if it kills me!
Keep pushin', Caramel! That's it, Bumpkin!
I know it's hard work, but you
guys are doin' great! YEEHAW!
Hey, Applejack! How's everything going?
Oh, just dandy. Little slow startin'
but peachy all the same.
There's a lot of groung to clear, ya hear?
We can't ever start the
plantin' and the waterin'...
...until we get all these heaps
o' snow hightailed outta here.
Well, I'd like to help.
Well... I... I don't know, Twilight.
Just give me a chance!
Well, I never turn down a hard worker, but...
"Think of how much quicker they could
wrap up winter with your magic!"
I could use a come-to-life spell...
Here goes.
She's awful strong for such a little pony.
That's my girl! Following my advice.
And what in tarnation does that mean?
Slow down! SLOW DOWN!
What's goin' on?
What'd you do?
You used magic, didn't you?!
Nuts, Twilight! You used magic!
The nerve, can you believe her?
That's not how we do it round here, Twilight.
And especially not on my farm!
Well, see... I just wanted to...
Oh!
Come on, Twilight. Come on out!
I'm a winter mess up.
Oh, you're good at a lot of things.
Just not nest making, ice skating,
animal waking, snow clearing...
Huh, thanks a lot for making
me feel sooo much better.
That's what I'm here for, sister.
Rainbow Dash, y'all on the weather team
need to melt the rest of this snow here...
...on the ground and the trees pronto.
Got it!
You can't! My poor little animals' homes
will get flooded if the snow melts too fast.
Got it.
I'm tellin' you, Rainbow.
You gotta melt that snow now!
No! You simply must wait!
Okay...
Go.
Stop.
Go!
Stop!
GO!
STOP!
Urgh! Make up your minds!
Oh! What in Equestria are
all you arguing about?
This sort of sillyness is why we
were late for spring last year.
And the year before that.
And the year before that!
Did she say late?
I was hoping my amazingly inspirational speech
would urge everyone to do better than last year.
But now it looks like we're
going to be later than ever!
I mean just look at this catastrophe.
The ice scorers made the ice
chunks too big to melt.
The nest designer's horrendously behind.
We need several hundred
and she's only made one.
And don't get me started on all the clouds still
in the sky, the icicles on the trees...
Oh, this isn't good. Not at all!
And it's gonna be all to pieces disastrous
if we can't get our seeds all planted.
Chillax, Applejack. We're busting
our chops as fast as we can.
No, not fast! You have to wake animals slowly.
Uh, AJ?
Oh, good gravy! Caramel lost the
grass seeds again, didn't he?
Ey-yup.
Ditzy-Doo accidentally went north
to get the southern birds!
Oh, that featherbrain! Didn't she learn
her lesson last year, when she went west?
Stop this at once! We don't have time to argue!
It's almost sundown.
Spring is going to be late again.
Another year of scandal and shame!
If only we could be more organized...
Spike! Get my checklist and clipboard.
Stat!
Eh... Yes, m'am.
Stop everypony!
Stop!
Sorry.
I know you all want to
complete your jobs on time.
But arguing is no way to go about it!
What you need is...
Organization!
And I'm just the pony for the job.
I can't believe it. Spring is here! On time!
And we have you to thank for it.
If it weren't for your organizing
skills, we would still be arguing.
Ey-yup.
It was a team effort.
And since you helped every team,
we have an official vest for you.
We give you the title "All-Team Organizer"!
Gosh... I don't even know what to say.
Thank you, everypony!
And hereby I declare that winter is...
...wrapped up on time!
Spike sure gonna be in for a hog-sized
surprise when that last piece a' ice melts.
"Dear Princess Celestia."
"Winter Wrap Up was one of the most special
things I've ever been a part of here in Ponyville."
"It helped me to learn that we all have hidden
talents and if we're patient and diligent..."
"...we're sure to find them."
"And as always, with good friendship and
teamwork, ponies can accomplish anything."
How's that, Spike?
Spike?
Oh, Spike...
Once upon a time,
in a magical land of Equestria...
...there were two regal sisters
who ruled together...
...and created harmony for all the land.
To do this, the eldest used her unicorn
powers to raise the sun at dawn...
...the younger brought out
the moon to begin the night.
Thus, the two sisters maintained balance
All the different types of ponies.
But as time went on,
the younger sister became resentful.
The ponies relished and played in the day
her elder sister brought forth...
...but shunned and slept
through her beautiful night.
One fateful day, the younger unicorn refused
to lower the moon to make way for the dawn.
The elder sister tried to reason with her...
...but the bitterness in the young one's heart...
...had transformed her into a
Nightmare Moon.
She vowed that she would shroud
the land in eternal night.
Reluctantly, the elder sister harnessed
The Elements of Harmony!
Using the magic of the Elements of Harmony,
she defeated her younger sister...
...and banished her permanently in the moon.
The elder sister took on responsibility
for both sun and moon....
...and harmony has been maintained
in Equestria for generations since.
Hm... Elements of Harmony.
I know I've heard of those before.
But where?
My Little Pony, My Little Pony...
Aaaaah...
My Little Pony
I used to wonder what friendship could be.
My Little Pony
Until you all shared its magic with me.
Big adventure
Tons of fun
A beautiful heart
Faithful and strong
Sharing kindness
It's an easy feat
And magic makes it all complete!
You have My Little Pony...
Do you know you are my very best friends?
There you are, Twilight!
Moondancer is having a little get-together
in the west castle courtyard.
You wanna come?
Oh, sorry girls. I got a lot
of studying to catch up on.
Does that pony do anything except study?
I think she's more interested
in books than friends.
I know I've heard of the Elements of Harmony.
Spike! Spike!!!
Spike?
There you are.
Quick, find me that old copy of
"Predictions and prophesies".
What's that for?
Well, it was a gift for Moondancer, but...
Oh, Spike. You know we don't
have time for that sort of thing.
But we're on a break!
No... no, no, no no no!
SPIKE!!!
It's over here!
Elements... elements, e e e... Aha!
Mare in the Moon?
Mare in the Moon?
But that's just an old ponies' tale.
Mare... mare... AHA!
"The Mare in the Moon - myth
from olden pony times..."
"...a powerful pony, who
wanted to rule Equestria..."
"...defeated by the Elements of Harmony
and imprisoned in the moon."
"Legend has it that on the longest
day of the thousandth year..."
"...the stars will aid in her escape and
she will bring about nighttime eternal."
Spike! Do you know what this means?
No.
Take a note, please. To the Princess.
Okie dokie.
"My dearest teacher. My continuing studies
of pony magic have led me to discover..."
"...that we're on the precipice of disaster."
Hold on!
Preci... preci...
Threshold.
Threee...
Uh... Brink?
That something really bad is about to happen!
"For you see, the mythical Mare in
the Moon is in fact Nightmare Moon..."
"...and she's about to return to Equestria
and bring with her eternal night."
"Something must be done to make sure this
terrible prophesy does not come true."
"I await your quick response.
Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."
Twilight. Sparkle. Got it!
Great! Send it.
Now?
Of course!
I don't know, Twilight.
Princess Celestia is a little busy getting
ready for the Summer Sun Celebration.
And it's, like, the day after tomorrow.
That's just it, Spike.
The day after tomorrow is the thousandth
year of the Summer Sun Celebration.
It's imperative that
the Princess is told right away.
Impera... impera...
Important!
Okay, okay.
There! It's on its way.
But I wouldn't hold your breath.
Oh, I'm not worried, Spike.
The princess trusts me completely.
In all the years she's been my mentor,
she's never once doubted me.
See? I knew she would wanna
take immediate action.
"My dearest, most faithful student, Twilight."
"You know that I value your diligence
and that I trust you completely."
"But you simply must stop
reading those dusty old books."
"My Dear Twilight. There is more to
a young pony's life than studying."
"So I'm sending you
to supervise the preparations..."
"...for the Summer Sun Celebration in
this year's location, Ponyville."
"And I have an even more essential
task for you to complete."
"Make some friends!"
Look on the bright side, Twilight.
The princess arranged for you to stay in a library.
Doesn't that make you happy?
Yes! Yes it does. You know why?
Because I'm right.
I'll check on the preparations
as fast as I can...
...then get to the library and find
some proof of Nightmare Moon's return.
Then when will you make friends,
like the Princess said?
She said to check on preparations.
I am her student and I'll do my royal duty.
But the fate of Equestria does
not rest on me making friends.
Thank you, sirs.
Maybe the ponies in Ponyville have
interesting things to talk about?
Come on, Twilight. Just try.
Hello?
Well, that was interesting, all right.
Official Overseer's Checklist.
Banquet preparations.
Sweet Apple Acres.
YEEHAW!
Let's get this over with.
Good afternoon. My name is Twilight Sparkle...
Well, howdy-do, miss Twilight?
A pleasure makin' your acquaintance.
I'm Applejack. We here at Sweet Apple Acres
sure do like makin' new friends.
Friends? Actually... I...
So, what can I do you for?
Well, I am in fact here to supervise
preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration.
And you're in charge of the food?
We sure as sugar are.
Would you care to sample some?
As long as it doesn't take too long.
Soup's on, everypony!
Now, why don't I introduce
y'all to the Apple family?
Thanks, but I really need to hurry.
This here's Apple Fritter,
Apple Bumpkin, Red Gala...
...Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Caramel
Apple, Apple Strudel, Apple Tart, Baked Apple,
Apple Brioche, Apple Cinnamon Crisp...
Big Macintosh, Apple Bloom
aaaand Granny Smith.
Up and at 'em Granny Smith. We got guests.
Wha...? Soup's on?
I'm up, here I come, I'm comin'...
Why, I'd say they're already part of the family.
Okay. Well, I can see the food situation
is handled, so we'll be on our way.
Aren't you gonna to stay for brunch?
Sorry, but we have an awful lot to do...
Fine.
Food's all taken care of. Next is weather.
Ugh... I ate too much pie.
There's supposed to be a pegasus pony
named Rainbow Dash clearing the clouds.
Well, she's not doing a very good job, is she?
Uh... Excuse me?
Let me help you.
Oops. I guess I overdid it.
Um... uh, how about this?
My very own patented Rain-Blow Dry.
No no, don't thank me. You're quite welcome.
Let me guess, you're Rainbow Dash.
The one and only!
Why? You heard of me?
I heard you're supposed
to be keeping the sky clear.
I'm Twilight Sparkle and the Princess
sent me to check on the weather.
Yeah, yeah. That'll be a snap.
I'll do it in a jiffy. Just as soon
as I'm done practicing.
Practicing for what?
The Wonderbolts!
They're gonna perform at
the celebration tomorrow.
And I'm gonna show 'em my stuff.
*The* Wonderbolts?
Yup.
The most talented flyers in all of Equestria?
That's them!
Pfft... Please.
They'd never accept a pegasus who can't
even keep the sky clear for one measly day.
Hey. I could clear the sky in ten seconds flat.
Prove it.
Loop-de-loop around and WHAM!
What'd I say. Ten. Seconds. Flat.
I'd never leave Ponyville hanging.
You should see the look on your face.
You're a laugh, Twilight Sparkle.
I can't wait to hang out some more.
Wow. She's amazing!
Wait! It's kinda pretty once you get used to it.
Decorations. Beautiful...
Yes. The decor's coming along nicely.
This oughta be quick.
I'll be at the library in no time.
Beautiful indeed.
Not the decor. Her!
No, no, no... Oh my goodness no.
How are my spines? Are they straight?
Good afternoon.
Just a moment, please.
I'm in the zone as it were.
Oh yes! Sparkle always does
the trick, does it not?
Why, Rarity, you are a talent!
Now... um, how can I help youuuuaAARGH!
Oh my stars, darling! What ever
happened to your coiffure?
Oh, you mean my mane? Well, it's a long story.
I'm just here to check on the decorations
and then I'll be out of your hair.
Out of MY hair? What about YOUR hair?
Wait! Where are we going? HELP!
No, no, uh-uh.
Too green. Too yellow. Too puffy.
Not puffy enough. Too frilly. Too shiny.
Now go on, my dear.
You were telling me where you're from.
I've... urgh... been... sent...
from... Canterlot... to...
Canterlot?!
Oh, I am so envious. The glamor, the sophistication.
I've always dreamed of living there!
I can't wait to hear all about it.
We are gonna be the best of friends, you and I.
Emerald?! What was I thinking?
Let me get you some rubies!
Quick! Before she decides
to dye my coat a new color.
Wasn't she wonderful?
Focus, Casanova. What's next on the list?
Oh. Music. It's the last one.
Oh my. Um... Stop, please, everyone.
Excuse me, sir. I mean, no offense.
But your rhythm is just a teeny, tiny bit off.
Now follow me, please. A one.
A two. A one-two-three...
Hello!
Oh my. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten your birds.
I'm just here to check up on the music
and it's sounding beautiful.
I'm Twilight Sparkle.
What's your name?
Um... I'm Fluttershy...
I'm sorry, what was that?
My name is ...
Didn't quite catch that.
Well, um, it looks like your birds are back,
so I guess everything's in order.
Keep up the good work!
Ooookay.
Well, that was easy.
A BABY DRAGON!
Oh, I've never seen a baby dragon before.
He's so cute!
Well well well.
Oh my, he talks.
I didn't know dragons could talk.
That's just so incredibly wonderful. I...
I just don't even know what to say.
Well, in that case we better be going.
Wait, wait! What's his name?
I'm Spike.
Hi, Spike. I'm Fluttershy.
Wow! A talking dragon!
And what do dragons talk about?
Well, what do you wanna know?
Absolutely everything!
Well, I started out as a cute
little purple-and-green egg...
...and that's the story of my whole entire life.
Well, up until today.
Do you wanna hear about today?
Oh yes, please!
I am so sorry! How did we get here so fast?
This is where I'm staying while in Ponyville.
And my poor baby dragon needs his sleep.
No, I don't!
Awww, wook at that. He's so sweepy, he
can't even keep his wittle bawance.
Poor thing. You simply must get into bed!
Yes yes. We'll get right on that.
Well, goodnight!
Huh. Rude much?
Sorry, Spike. But I have to convince the
Princess that Nightmare Moon is coming...
...and we're running out of time!
I just need to be alone, so I can study...
...while a bunch of crazy ponies
try to make friends all the time.
Now where's the light?
SURPRISE!
Surprise!
Hi! I'm Pinkie Pie and I threw
this party just for you!
Were you surprised, were you, were you?
Huh huh huh?
Very surprised.
Libraries are supposed to be quiet.
That's silly! What kind of welcome
party would this be if it were quiet?
I mean, DUH! BORING!

Are you alright, sugar cube?
Awww, she's so happy, she's crying!
Hot sauce.
What? It's good!
Hey, Twilight! Pinkie Pie started
Pin the Tail on the Pony. Wanna play?
No! All the ponies in this town are CRAZY!
Do you know what time it is?
It's the eve of the Summer Sun Celebration.
Everypony has to stay up or they'll
miss the Princess raise the sun.
You really should lighten up Twilight.
It's a party!
Here I thought I'd have time to learn
more about the Elements of Harmony.
But, silly me, all this ridiculous
friendmaking has kept me from it!
"Legend has it that in the longest day
of the thousandth year..."
"...the stars will aid in her escape and
she will bring about everlasting night."
I hope the Princess was right.
I hope it really is just an old pony tale.
Come on, Twilight!
It's time to watch the sun rise!
Isn't this exciting?
AreyouexcitedcauseImexcited
Iveneverbeensoexcitedwell...
...exceptforthattimethatIsawyouwalking

But, I mean, really, who can top that?
Fillies and gentlecolts.
As mayor of Ponyville,
it is my great pleasure...
...to announce the beginning
of the Summer Sun Celebration!
In just a few moments our town will
witness the magic of the sunrise.
And celebrate this, the longest day of the year!
And now it is my great honor to
introduce to you the ruler of our land.
The very pony, who gives us the sun
and the moon each and every day.
The good, the wise, the bringer
of harmony to all of Equestria...
Ready?
...Princess Celestia!
This can't be good.
Remain calm, everypony.
There must be a reasonable explanation.
I love guessing games! Is she hiding?
She's gone!
She's good!
Oh no...
Nightmare Moon!
Oh, my beloved subjects!
It's been so long since I've seen your
precious little sun-loving faces.
What did you do with our Princess?!
Whoa there, Nelly...!
Why, am I not royal enough for you?
Don't you know who I am?
More guessing games!
Um... Pokey Smokes!
How about Queen Meanie?
No! Black Snooty, Black Snooty...!
Does my crown no longer count now that
I have been imprisoned for a thousand years?
Did you not recall the legend?
Did you not see the signs?
I did! And I know who you are!
You're the Mare in the Moon.
Nightmare Moon.
Well well well. Somepony who remembers me.
Then you also know why I'm here.
You're here to... to...
Remember this day, little ponies,
for it was your last.
From this moment forth...
THE NIGHT WILL LAST FOREVER!
This meteor shower tonight's gonna be amazing!
Awesome!
You know, this shower only happens
once every 100 years.
A centennial celebration!
We better get a move on!
Don't wanna be late!
There.
Spike, did you grab my quill and ink?
Check!
Scrolls?
Check!
I've also packed a telescope,
apples, bananas, fruit punch...
...and my freshly baked home-made
triple-decker nut-crazy vanilla cream cookies!
I can see that.
Once again you read my mind, Spike.
And that is why you are my number one assistant.
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.
That is my you are my number one assistant.
Missed that! Huh...?
I said...!
Come on, let's get going.
Wait! I almost forgot.
I wanna bring the Astronomical Astronomer's
Almanac to All Things Astronomy.
The Astronomo-lomo homono what?
You know that really old big blue book
on stars, moons, planets, the Universe...?
Right. Check!
Hey! What's taking my number one assistant so long?
I was sure I put the astronomer's guide back.
The book would have helped me identify
different planets and stars tonight.
Well... Maybe someone borrowed it?
Besides, you don't need that book.
You can already name
all the planets and stars, cause...
...you're super smart and...
...astronomically awesome!
Thanks, Spike. You're such a flatterer.
Yeah, I'm a sweet talker.
And a number one assistant, right?
Check!
Wow, Twilight! You're lucky
to have such a rad assistant.
I wish I had someone to do whatever I told them.
Ooh! Ooh! Me! Me! Me!
I'll do whatever you want, Rainbow Dash!
Oh yeah, pipsqueak?
How about taking out the trash?
Yes, ma’am!
Do we have Spike to thank again
for this amazing spread?
Isn't he simply amazing?
Oh, come on.
I said come on.
Little Spikey-wikey!
Who knew that big ferocious dragon
started off co cutesy mootsy?
Spike, you are such a little star,
that I had to make a little bow tie for you.
Gosh. You guys are embarrassing me. Stop that.
Twilight, your turn.
Spike, that's enough.
All right. That's enough.
Hey, everypony! The show is starting!
Wow...
Huh?
Wow! These cookies are deeleesh!
Spike made them.
Speaking of, Spike, can you bring us some punch?
Spike?
Ooh, poor little thing.
Aww... He's worked himself to the bone.
And now the punch has been...
...spiked!
Goodnight, Spike.
Sweet dreams, number one assistant.
"The Study of Comets."
"Comets are small, irregularly shaped bodies..."
"...that are made of non-volatile grains
and frozen gasses. They..."
"...have body structures
that are fragile and diverse..."
Shoot!
Oh... This is a job for Spike.
If only he were awake...
Hoo!
Wait! Don't go!
Don't be afraid.
Thank you for returning my scroll.
Hoo! Hoo!
Uhoo.
Gosh, it's cold tonight.
Say, would you like to relax in here
and keep my company while I work?
Hoo! Hoo!
Now, where was I?
Oh, yes. "...fragile and diverse with
a surrounding cloud of material called a coma..."
"...that grows in size and brightness
as the comet approaches the sun..."
I overslept!
I know it's already ten, but...
...I'm scaly-tailed and bright-eyed...
...and ready to work twice as fast.
Oh please, don't be upset, Twilight.
And what do you want for breakfast? Oatmeal?
How about a sunflower smoothie? Grass pancakes?
Spike, don't worry.
But my morning chores...
It's okay. Owloysius did them for you.
Who?
He's our new junior assistant.
He's gonna help out with your chores
so you won't be so tired all the time.
Wha... Wh...
What do we need a junior assistant for?
I'm not tired. I do fine on my own.
I don't need sleep, I...
Spike, don't worry.
He's just here to help out a little.
Now, I have to go out. So why don't you
introduce yourself to Owloysius?
He's in the library.
Worried? Do I look worried? I'm not worried.
Who's worried?
Hello?
Hellooo!
Whoa!
Dude, that's creepy.
Uh... Hi there!
I'm Spike. I'm sure Twilight
has told you all about me...
Hoo.
Uh, Spike? You know, assistant number one?
Hoo?
I'm Spike!
And who are you? And what are you?
Hoo!
Who?
Hoo!
I thought your name was Owloysius!
Hoo?
Okay, "Who", "Owloysius", whatever.
I'm Spike, okay?
Look! All you need to know
is that I'm number one...
...and you're number two. Got it?
Hoo?
So, a man of mystery, huh?
I'm keeping my eye on you!
I've got eyes in the back
of my head too, you know?
Well, not really, but...
You know what I mean!
That bird is out for my job.
He wants to be number one.
I'll prove to Twilight that
I deserve to be number one.
Not Freaky Feathers over there.
I won't let him have my job
if it's the last thing I do!
Oh, what a fantastical,
fluffelicious feathery little friend!
I'm... HOOked!
He's just wonderful.
"He's just wonderful."
Uh, yes. Wonderful.
He's quite...
...the charmer.
And Owloysius's just such a star...
...I just had to make the little bow for you.
What's he all sad and sore about?
He's probably just jealous of Owloysius.
Maybe Spike feels threatened
or worried that Owloysius will replace him?
Replace him? Hah! It's crazy!
Spike knows he can't be replaced.
They're trying to replace me!
I better step it up and make sure
that Twilight and Owloysius...
...know that I'm still number one...
Hey, Spike! Can you fetch my that book
called Two-headed Myth...
...Mythological Mysteries!
I know where it is.
Thanks, Owloysius.
Hey, Spike, no worries.
Owloysius flew up and got the book for me.
Oh, and gee!
I guess I need Ferrets of Fairyland too.
Hey!
Climb down from there before you fall.
Shoot!
Yes, sir!
My last writing quill. It's broken.
Never fear, Spike, your
number one assistant, is here.
Quill... quill... Where is it?
Not here...
Quill...
Quill, where is it...?
Hoo.
Where am I gonna get a quill?
Spike, wait! Wait!
But the store is called "Quills and Sofas".
You only sell two things!
Sorry, Junior. All outta quills until Monday.
Need sofa?
I swore I had one here somewhere.
Ah, here it is!
A quince!
Not a quince. A quill!
Right. A quail?
A quilt!
A quesadilla?
Aha!
A quiche!
Not a quiche. A quill!
Nope. Sorry. All outta quills.
Shoot.
Come on, chicken!
Here, chicky chicky chicky!
Here, chick chick chick chicky!
Come here!
Come here!
Spike...
...to the rescue.
Oh, Spike.
I was calling out for you when you were
turning this place upside down.
Owloysius gave me one of
his feathers to use as a quill.
That's just great.
Perfect!
Sweet!
I think I'll just, uh...
...finish up the rest of my chores!
Or did Owloysius already do them?
Oh, no no. There are quite a lot of them.
Well, that's fine. Because I can just
stay up all night and finish...
Poor Spike.
He'll come around.
He's genuinely a good little guy.
Spike. What is this?
You said this book was missing.
Well, Owloysius found it right where it belongs...
...but like this.
How did it get this way?
Uh... Well, um...
You see, I...
I just didn't wanna disappoint you and, uh...
Have you ever seen a dragon sneeze?
I've seen a dragon lie.
I'm very disappointed in you, Spike.
You set me up!
Well, two can play that game.
Hoo!
Not "who"! Two!
Owloysius is out to take my place. I just know it!
I've gotta stop him.
But how?
Ah...
Come along, Opal.
Let's hurry up and get to Fluttershy's tea party.
So lifelike.
And when Twilight discovers it
shredded up on her floor...
...she'll think mouse-eating Owloysius is to blame.
And I'll be number one...
...again!
That poor little field mouse!
Torn to pieces!
It must have been Owloysius!
You know, since owls eat, you know, mice.
What a terrible, terrible bird!
He must be punished!
Right?
Spike! I don't know what upsets me more.
That you deliberately tried to set up Owloysius...
...or that you actually thought
this pathetic attempt would work!
You've let your jealousy get the best of you, Spike.
I am truly disappointed.
This is NOT the Spike I know and love.
She...
She doesn't love me anymore.
Twilight hates me.
I'm cold, hungry, tired and lonely.
Could it get any worse?
I guess that's a yes.
Hello?
Hello!
What is that?
If this is what running away is all about...
...I never wanna go home!
Gems! Mmm... Woohoo!
Even if my tummy's full...
...the rest of me is still empty.
I miss Twilight and the pony gang.
But she doesn't love me anymore.
So, I'm better off here.
All by myself.
Wow. Seems to be getting warmer.
The steam is great for my complexion...
...but it's sure getting hot in here.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY CAVE?
AND WHY ARE YOU EATING MY GEMS?
Heyah bro!
I didn't know this was your cave.
And I didn't know these were your gems, but...
...we're cool, right?
Whoa, whoa!
Hey... We're like brothers, you know?
I mean, you're a dragon, I'm a dragon...
It's us against the world, right?
You don't scare me!
So you're big.
Really big.
And your claws are super sharp.
Tail...
...extra spiky.
But, uh...
You don't scare me! Ha!
How do you like that?
Uh...
I'd love to stay, but gotta go!
See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya!
Uhoo!
Spike! Over here!
Am I glad to see you!
Hurry! Come on!
It's too dark! I can't see!
Hoo. Hoohoo!
Spike. We were so worried about you.
*I* was so worried about you.
Why did you run away?
I thought you didn't need me anymore.
And that you didn't love me anymore.
Spike. Sure, I was disappointed...
...but you are my number one assistant!
And friend.
And you always will be.
It's just that sometimes I need some help at night.
I can't ask you to stay up late.
You're a baby dragon and you need your rest.
Owls are nocturnal. So I asked Owloysius to help.
But not to take your place.
No one could ever replace you, Spike.
Not even when you are being a jealous numskull.
I'm sorry, Twilight.
I've never should have been so jealous.
And I'm sorry too, Spike.
I should have been more sensitive.
And Owloysius...
I know now that you weren't out to take our job.
Forgive me?
Hoo?
Me. Forgive me, Spike.
Hoo!
He forgives you, Spike.
Hey! How did you guys know where I was?
It was your ketchup covered feet.
Owloysius discovered your footprints and
we followed them all the way to the cave.
Oh yeah, the ketchup.
It looked pretty real though, didn't it?
Uh...
I know Princess Celestia will wanna
read about what happened today...
I'm ready when you are.
Hey, Spike. Why don't you
write to Princess Celestia?
And tell her what you've learned?
Really?
Why, that's a big responsibility!
I know.
But nothing my number one assistant can't handle.
"Dear Princess Celestia."
"This is Spike, writing to you
about my adventures."
"This week I've learned that being jealous..."
"...and telling lies gets you nowhere in friendship."
"I also learned that there's plenty of love
for every friend to share."
"So from here on out,
I promise, that I, Spike, will..."
Oh, Spike.
Hoo?
Who? Spike! You kno...
Oooooh...
...Elements of Harmony...
Mare in the Moon?
But that's just an old ponies' tale...!
...she will bring about nighttime eternal...!
...it's imperative that
the Princess is told right away...
...See? I knew she would wanna
take immediate action...
...My dear Twilight. There is more to
a young pony's life than studying...
...Make some friends...!
...All the ponies in this town are CRAZY...!
...I hope the Princess was right...
...She's gone...!
...Oh no. Nightmare Moon...!
Want sharper video quality? Want
clearer audio? Try GOM Player now!
Seize her! Only she knows
where the Princess is!
Stand back, you foals!
Come back here!
Nighttime? Forever?
Where's she going?
We gotta stop Nightmare...!
You've been up all night, Spike.
You are a baby dragon after all.
Elements, elements, elements...
How can I stop the Nightmare Moon
without the Elements of Harmony?!
And just what are the Elements of Harmony?!
And how did you know about
Nightmare Moon, huh?
Are you a spy?
Simmer down, Sally. She ain't no spy.
But she sure knows what's going on.
Don't you, Twilight?
I read all about the
prediction of Nightmare Moon.
Some mysterious objects called the Elements of
Harmony are the only things that can stop her.
But I don't know what they are. Where to
find them. I don't even know what they do!
A Reference Guide.
How did you find that?!
IT WAS UNDER "E"!
"There are six Elements of Harmony,
but only five are known..."
"Kindness, Laughter, Generosity,
Honesty and Loyalty."
"The sixth is a complete mystery."
"It is said, the last known
location of the five Elements..."
"...was in the ancient castle of the royal
pony sisters. It is located in what is now..."
The Everfree Forest!
Whee! Let's go!
Not so fast!
Look, I appreciate the offer, but I'd
really rather do this on my own.
No can do, sugar cube. We sure ain't lettin' any
friend of ours goin' to that creepy place alone.
We're stickin' to you like
caramel to candy apple.
Especially if there's candy apples in there.
What? Those things are good!
So none of you have been in here before?
Heavens no! Just look at it - it's dreadful!
And it ain't natural.
Folk say it don't work the same as Equestria.
What's that supposed to mean?
Nopony knows. You know why?
Rainbow! Quit it!
Cause everypony who's ever come in...
...has never... come... OUT!
Fluttershy! Quick!
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness...
Hold on! I'm a-comin'!
Applejack! What do I do?!
Let go.
Are you crazy?!
No, I ain't. I promise you'll be safe.
That's not true!
Now listen here. What I'm sayin'
to you is the honest truth.
Let go and you'll be safe.
Sorry girls. I'm not used to holding
anything more than a bunny or two.
And once Pinkie and Rarity
were saved, WHOAH...
Me and Fluttershy loop-de-looped around and WHAM!
Got you right in a nick of time.
Yes, Rainbow, I was there.
And I'm very grateful, but we gotta...
A manticore!
We've gotta get past him!
Take that, you ruffian!
MY HAIR!
Wait...
YEEHAW! Get along, little doggie!
Wait...
All yours, partner.
I'm on it!
Wait...!
Rainbow!
WAIT!!!
Shhh... It's okay.
Oh, you poor, poor little baby.
Little?
Now this might hurt for juuust a second.
Fluttershy!
Are you just a little baby kitty, aren't you?
Yesh you are, yesh you are.
How did you know about the thorn?
I didn't. Sometimes we all just
need to be shown a little kindness.
My eyes need a rest from all this icky muck.
Well, I didn't mean that literally.
That ancient ruin could be right in front
of our faces and we wouldn't even know it!
Oh wait. I think I stepped in somethin'.
It's just mud.
Pinkie, what are you doing?! Run!
Oh, girls. Don't you see...?
When I was a little filly and
the sun was going dooown...
Tell me she's not...
The darkness and the shadows, they
would always make me frooown...
She is.
I'd hide under my pillow
from what I thought I saw,
But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way
to deal with fears at aaall!
Then what is?
Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall,
learn to face your fears.
You'll see that they can't hurt you,
just laugh to make them disappear.
Sooo, giggle at the ghostly!
Guffaw at the grossly!
Crack up at the creepy!
Whoop it up with the weepy!
Chortle at the cooky!
Snortle at the spooky!
And tell that big dumb scary face
to take a hike and leave you alone...
Andifhethinkshecanscareyouthenhesgotanotherthink
comingandtheveryideaofsuchathingjustmakesyouwanna...
LAAAUGH!
Where are we gonna cross *this*?
What a world, what a world...!
Excuse me, sir. Why are you crying?
Well, I don't know. I was just sitting
here, minding my own business...
...when this tacky little cloud of
purple smoke just whisked past me...
...and tore a half of my beloved mustache...
...CLEAN OFF!
And now I look simply horrid!
Oh, gimme a break!
That's what all the fuss is about?
Why, of course it is!
How can you be so insensitive?
Oh, just look at him.
Such lovely luminescent scales...!
I know.
...and your expertly coiffed mane...!
Oh, I know, I know.
...your fabulous manicure...!
It's so true!
All ruined without your beautiful mustache!
It's true, I'm hideous!
I simply cannot let such a crime
against fabulosity go uncorrected!
What did you do that for?!
Rarity, what are you...
My mustache! How wonderful!
You look smashing!
Oh, Rarity! Your beautiful tail!
Oh. It's fine, my dear. Short tails are
in the season.
Besides, it'll grow back.
So would the mustache...
We can cross now! Let's go...!
Allow me.
There it is! The ruin that holds
the Elements of Harmony! We made it!
Twilight! Wait for us!
We're almost there!
What's with you and falling off cliffs today?
Now what?!
Duh!
Oh yeah!
Rainbow...! Rainbow...!
Who's there?
I ain't scared of you! Show yourself!
We've been eagerly awaiting the arrival
of the best flyer in Equestria.
Who?
Why you, of course!
Really?! I mean... oh yeah! Me!
Hey, uh, you wouldn't mind telling
the Wonderbolts that, would ya?
'Cos I've been trying to get
into that group for like, ever!
No, Rainbow Dash. We want you to join us!
The Shadowbolts!
We're the greatest aerial
team in the Everfree Forest.
And soon we will be the greatest in all Equestria.
But first, we need a captain.
The most magnificent...
Yep!
...swiftest...
Yes!
...bravest flyer in all the land!
Yes! It's all true!
We need...
...you!
Sign me up!
Just let me tie this bridge real
quick and then we have a deal.
No! It's them or us!
Rainbow! What's taking so long?
Oh no.
Rainbow!
Don't listen to them!
Well...?
You...
Thank you! For the offer, I mean.
But... I'm afraid I have to say no.
See? I'd never leave my friends hanging!
Wow.
Come on, Twilight!
Isn't this what you've been waitin' for?
The Elements of Harmony! We've found them!
Careful... Careful...!
One, two, three, four...
There's only five!
Where's the sixth?
"When the five are present..."
"...a spark will cause
the sixth Element to be revealed."
What in the hay is that supposed to mean?
I'm not sure, but I have an idea.
Stand back. I don't know what will happen.
Come on now, y'all. She needs to concentrate.
Twilight!
The Elements!
Twilight! Where are you?!
Look!
Come on!
You're kidding. You're kidding, right?
Just one spark...
Come on, come on!
No! No!
But... where's the sixth Element?!
You little foal! Thinking you could defeat me!?
Now you will never see your princess.
Or your sun!
THE NIGHT WILL LAST FOREVER!
You think you can destroy
the Elements of Harmony just like that?
Well, you're wrong.
Because the spirits of
the Elements of Harmony are right HERE!
What?
Applejack, who reassured me when I was
in doubt represents the spirit of...
Honesty!
Fluttershy, who tamed the manticore with
her compassion represents the spirit of...
Kindness!
Pinkie Pie, who banished fear by giggling in
the face of danger represents the spirit of...
Laughter!
Rarity, who calmed a sorrowful serpent with
a meaningful gift represents the spirit of...
Generosity!
And Rainbow Dash, who could not abandon
her friends for her own heart's desire
represents the spirit of...
Loyalty!
The spirits of these five ponies got us
through every challenge you threw at us!
You still don't have the sixth Element!
The spark didn't work!
But it did. A different kind of spark.
I felt it the very moment I realized how
happy I was to hear you... To see you...
How much I cared about you!
The spark ignited inside me
when I realized that you all...
...are my friends!
You see, Nightmare Moon, when those
Elements are ignited by the...
...the spark that resides in the heart of us all...
The Element of...
Magic!
NOOOOOO!!!
My head...
Everypony okay?
Oh, thank goodness!
Why Rarity, it's so lovely!
I know! I'll never part with it again!
No. Your necklace. It looks
just like your cutie mark.
So does yours!
Look at mine! Look at mine!
Oooh yeah!
Gee, Twilight! I though you were
just speaking a lot of hooey.
But I reckon we really do represent
the elements of friendship.
Indeed you do.
Princess Celestia!
Twilight Sparkle, my faithful student.
I knew you could do it.
But... you told me it was all an old pony tale.
I told you that you needed to
make some friends. Nothing more.
I saw the signs of Nightmare Moon's return...
...and I knew it was you who had
the magic inside to defeat her.
But you could not unleash it until you
let true friendship into your heart.
Now if only another will as well.
Princess Luna...
It is been a thousand years since
I have seen you like this.
Time to put our differences behind us.
We were meant to rule together, little sister.
Sister?!
Will you accept my friendship?
I'm so sorry! I missed you so much, big sister!
I've missed you, too.
...Hey! You know what this calls for?
A PARTY!
Why so glum, my faithful student?
Are you not happy that Equestria is complete?
And you can return to your studies in Canterlot?
That's just it. Just when I learned how wonderful
it is to have friends, I have to leave them.
Spike! Take a note, please.
I, Princess Celestia, hereby decree...
...that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall
take on a new mission for Equestria.
She must continue to study
the magic of friendship.
She must report to me her findings
from her new home in Ponyville.
Oh thank you, Princess Celestia!
I'll study harder than ever before!
