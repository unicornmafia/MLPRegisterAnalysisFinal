eyes over here spike uh sorry for this to work it's crucial we keep our concentration totally on the ooh spike this magic needs our full attention to make it happen there's no other way i can't help it look never mind her she's just being pinkie pie super extra pinkie pie today twitchy-twitcha-twitcha-twitch pinkie pie what in the wide wide world of equestria are you up to oh it's my tail it's my tail it's a-twitchy-twitching and you know what that means actually pinkie i haven't the slightest idea the twitching means my pinkie sense is telling me that stuff's gonna start falling you should better duck for cover oh pinkie it's not gonna rain weather's barely even a cloud in the he just said nice catch in frog oh i'm so so sorry you okay twilight sparkle i just couldn't stand to see the pond getting so overpopulated what with the frogs all hopping into each other and all so i decided to fly as many as i can on over to froggy bottom bog of course you did bye bye um twilight you've got a little something on your face there oh really did your pinkie sense tell you that too nah i could just see it come on spike let's continue our practice session where there's a little less commotion wow that was amazing pinkie pie predicted something would fall and it did oh come on she said something would fall and a frog just happened to fall right around the same time a coincidence nothing else to it my tail my tail twitcha-twitch twitcha-twitch something else is gonna fall oh pinkie please nothing else is gonna faaaaaah ugh oh no twilight fell is it safe to go help her it's okay my tail stopped twitching that was amazing oh please uh twilight why are you hangin out in a ditch because pinkie pie predicted it honestly spike she did not two coincidences in a row like this may be unlikely but it's still easier to believe than twitchy tails that predict the future twitchy tail pinkie sense don't worry it's safe prediction already came true oh wait don't tell me you believe in this stuff too i know it doesn't make much sense but those of us who've been ponyville a while have learned over time that if pinkie's a-twitchin you better listen my ears are flopping my ears are flopping what does that mean i'll start a bath for you huh a bath this thing keeps on getting more ridiculous by the minute i get different little niggly feelings and they mean different things like when my back is itchy it means it's my lucky day and when my knee gets pinchy that means something scary is about to happen is your knee pinchy now no but my shoulder's achy that means there's an alligator in the tub how come your knee didn't get pinchy that isn't just scary it downright dangerous no it's not silly this is my pet alligator gummy he's got no teeth see okay okay i get it well i still don't believe all this special power stuff it's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo what's not to believe you do magic what's the difference huge for one thing magic is something you study and practice it only happens when you decide to do it and it's meant to make something specific that you choose to happen happen with you it makes no sense at all that so not true twilight sometimes it's a bunch of random things happening to my body at random times that supposedly predict the future i call them combos combos sure you know like ear flop then knee twitch then eye flutter that means the sky is about to be graced with a beautiful rainbow yeah sure uh-oh i feel a combo coming on ear flop eye flutter knee twitch you said that combo meant beautiful rainbow oh nonononono you're thinking of an ear flop then knee twitch then eye flutter this was an ear flop then eye flutter then knee twitch that usually means look out for opening doors you okay i don't believe this you don't believe because you don't understand okay now when you get another twitch we'll have all kinds of scientific information okie dokie lokie any twitches yet nopie dopie now anything wait hold on uh no are you kidding me after a whole day of nonstop twitching now that i've got you all hooked up you're not getting a single one i don't control it they just come and go that makes no sense sometimes you just have to believe in things even when you can't figure em out i will not believe in anything i cannot explain wait hold on i'm feeling something omygosh what what is it it's my tummy that usually means i'm hungry let's eat you know what just forget it i don't need to know if this is real or not i don't need to understand it i don't even care okie dokie lokie uh-oh pinkie have you seen twili uh-huh twilight what are you doing back there did you two plan this plan what this is ridiculous this can't be happening this makes no sense i have to figure this out twilight honestly spike don't you know better than to sneak up on ponies oh sorry but um well isn't that what you're doing no i'm doing scientific research pinkius piecus in its natural habitat pinkius whoecus there's something fishy going on with the whole twitchy prediction thing and i'm getting to the bottom of it so shhh come on pinkius piecus is on the move itchy nose aha that makes no sense see she's hiding like something's about to fall from the sky but a twitchy tail means something's gonna fall from the sky not an itchy nose this proves perhaps conclusively that spike where are you going i'm trying to teach you the value of scientific obse what's she doing now smelling a flower holy guacamole i don't know what that means probably that the flower smells good wait i'm getting something ear flop eye flutter knee twitch hold on you told me that's the combo that says watch out for opening doors you really really believe this stuff don't you here let me show you there's nothing to be afraid of you see i promise you there's nothing to fear from that whoaaa twilight you came to visit my new apple cellar how nice twi you okay uh twi here let me help ya okay take this down twitchy tail twitchy tail twitchy tail hush spike we can't let pinkie know we're here remember something's gonna fall something's gonna fall run for your lives ugh spike honestly you're overreact hey applejack whatchu doin takin more apples to my new apple cellar how about you pinkie whatchu doin oh letting twilight secretly follow me all day without me knowing you mean you knew all along why didn't you tell me silly that would have spoiled the secret tail still twitching all done clear skies from here on in as far as i can tell oh no what does that one mean dunno never gotten any like it before but whatever that shudder's about it's a doozy something you never expect to happen is gonna happen and it's gonna happen at froggy bottom bog that's where fluttershy's headed oh no is it about her i i'm not sure we better go and make sure she's okay calm down everypony all we know right now is that pinkie pie just got a case of the shivers that's all hey i thought you didn't believe in this stuff i don't i just want to be there to see the look on pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong okie dokie cold need a jacket or something no thanks i'm fine so what do you think happened to fluttershy i hope nothin i know but what do you think happened i'm tryin not to think about it me too but i'm thinking about it anyway like what if she exploded just exploded for no reason yeah like boom whoa i know what if what if she exploded and then and then exploded again can you do that can you explode twice of course not but what if she exploded and exploded again and then will you two stop she's fine i'm sure of it i hope you're right for fluttershy's sake look there's froggy bottom bog fluttershy fluttershy fluttershy you're okay of course what a relief i'm so glad everything's all right sorry i know it's not nice to gloat but aha i told you there was nothing to worry about and i was right pinkie pie said whatever she was shuddering about was a cough doozy and cough and the only cough doozy here is how right i am um twilight pinkie's made a lot of predictions today but cough what is that smell but what we've shown here is that there's no point in believing cough anything you can't see for yourself w-well then see what's b-behind you twilight i see it but i don't believe it is that a hydra who cares ruuun pinkie come on oh i'm so sorry everypony up that hill heeelp coming spike hang on i think we're gonna make it but pinkie's still shuddering oh lookie there it stopped ohhh therrre ittt isss agggainnn he'll be up here in no time quick one at a time cross uh do you know any spell for turning a hydra into a mouse no how about a squirrel no how about no small rodents of any kind that's too bad a hop skip and a jump wwwhoooa he's too close i'll distract him you two go now oh what would a brave pony like rainbow dash do chaaarge tttwilight tttwilight you have to jump i'll never make it you'll be fine i will not it's your only hooope you have to take a leap of faith no oh no nooo i knew you could do it twilight i don't know how it happened coincidence dumb luck or what but you said there'd be a doozy here at froggy bottom bog and i'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy i mean that hydra pinkie that wasn't it huh what wasn't what what are you talkin about pink the hydra wasn't the doozy i'm still getting the shudders you see there it is again whatever the doozy was at froggy bottom bog my pinkie sense says it still hasn't happened huh but i what the hydra wasn't the doozy how could it not be the doozy what could be doozier than that dunno but it just wasn't it i give up give what up twi the fight i can't fight it anymore i don't understand how why or what but pinkie sense somehow makes sense i don't see how it does but it just does just because i don't understand doesn't mean it's not true yyyouuu mean yyyou bbbelllieve yep i guess i do oh that was it that's the doozy what what is you believing i never expected that to happen that was the doozy oh and oh what a doozy of a doozy it was oh good spike you're here take a letter with pleasure twilight dear princess celestia i'm happy to report that spike what have i been saying about focus i know but i well what's wrong spike never thought you'd see me with an umbrella hat on not really no pinkie's tail's a-twitching what else can i do i am happy to report that i now realize there are wonderful things in this world you just can't explain but that doesn't necessarily make them any less true it just means you have to choose to believe in them and sometimes it takes a friend to show you the way honk honk

liven things up a bit and while the evening may not have gone as you planned i'm sure you'll agree that in the end it didn't turn out so bad for this group of friends you're right princess friends have a way of making even the worst of times into something pretty great yeah hanging out with friends talking laughing you mean doing exactly what i wanted to do the whole time yes spike you were right as horrible as our night was being together here has made it all better in fact it's made it the best night ever come one twilight you can do it okay here goes ha-ha you did it growing magic that's number ## twenty five different types of tricks and counting and i think this is the best trick so far hello rarity what's that oh it's the nothing just my awesome mustache sorry romeo as attractive and enticing as you look it's just for practice and it's gotta go wait rats gom player is used by millions of people around the world find out why twenty five twilight twenty five different kinds of tricks and counting i though unicorns are only supposed to have a little magic that matches their special talents true for ponies whose talents are for things like cooking or singing or math but what if the unicorn's special talent is magic like you twilight and you know a ton of magic oh spike stop i'm sure there are lots of ponies right here in ponyville that know just as much magic as me are you kidding i don't think there's another unicorn in all of equestria with your kind of ability twilight gangway coming through snips snails wh-what's going on why haven't you heard there is a new unicorn in town yeah they say that she's got more magical powers than any other unicorn ever really oh no way that honor goes to twilight here where is this unicorn oh she's in the town square come on yeah come on come on come all come and witness the amazing magic of the great and powerful trixie watch in awe as the great and powerful trixie performs the most spectacular feats of magic ever witnessed by pony eyes my my my what boasting come on nopony's as magical as twi twi twi oh h-hey rarity i mustache there's nothing wrong with being talented is there nothin at all cept when someone goes around showin it off like a schoolfilly with fancy new ribbons just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does not make one better than the rest of us especially when you got me around being better than the rest of us i mean yeah uh magic shmagic boo well well well it seems we have some neigh-sayers in the audience who is so ignorant as to challenge the magical ability of the great and powerful trixie do they not know that they're in the presence of the most magical unicorn in all of equestria just who does she think she is yeah since we all know that twilight here is spike shhh what what's wrong you see the way they reacted to trixie i don't want anyone thinking i'm the showoff so great and powerful trixie what makes you think you're so awesome anyway why only the great and powerful trixie have magic strong enough to vanquish the dreaded ursa major what no way when all hope was lost the ponies of hooffington had no one to turn to but the great and powerful trixie stepped in and with her awesome magic vanquished the ursa major and sent it back to its cave deep within the everfree forest sooo sweet that settles it trixie truly is the most talented most magical most awesome unicorn in ponyville no in all of equestria how do you know you didn't see it and besides twi it's true my enthusiastic little admirers trixie is most certainly the best in ponyville don't believe the great and powerful trixie well then i hereby challenge you ponyvillians anything you can do i can do better any takers anyone or is trixie destined to be the greatest equine who has ever lived please she's unbearable you gotta show her you just gotta there's no way i'm gonna use my magic now spike especially since how about you well how about it hm is there anything you can do that the great and powerful trixie can't i i well little hayseed that's it i can't stand for no more of this you show her aj can your magical powers do this top that missy oh ye of little talent watch and be amazed of the magic of trixie once again the great and powerful trixie prevails there is no need to go strutting around and showing off like that oh that's my job the don't call me rainbow and dash for nothing when trixie is through the only thing they'll call you is loser i think i'm gonna be sick seems like anypony with a dash of good sense would think twice before tussling with the great trixie what we need is another unicorn to challenge her someone with some magic of her own yeah a unicorn to show this unicorn who's boss a real unicorn to unicorn tussle enough enough all of you i take your hint but rarity is above such nonsense rainbow dash and applejack may behave like ruffians but rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace ooo what's the matter afraid you'll get a hair out of place in that rats nest you call a mane oh it is on you may think you're tough with all your so-called power but there is more to magic than your brutish ways a unicorn need to be more than just muscle a unicorn needs to have style a unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty rarity won't let trixie get the best of her she's strong she's beautiful she's quick i need a mirror get me a mirror what did she to my hair i know she did something terrible to my hair nothing it's fine it's gorgeous it's green what no green hair not green hair such an awful awful color well i never well twilight i guess it's up to you come on show her what you're made of what do you mean i'm nothing special yes you are you're better that her i'm not better than anyone you think you're better than the great and powerful trixie you think you have more magical talent well come on show trixie what you've got show us all who me i'm just run of the mill citizen of ponyville no powerful magic here i i think i can hear my laundry calling sorry gotta go twilight once again the great and powerful trixie has proven herself to be the most amazing unicorn in all of equestria was there ever any doubt here's your smoothie you asked for with extra hay just how you like it hmmm hay yes oh tell us another story great and powerful trixie yeah tell us about how you vanquished the ursa major trixie is far too exhausted from performing feats beyond imagination begone with you until morning of course great and powerful trixie anything you say we are at your beck and call what are you two doing just bringing the gnpt a the what the great n powerful trixie sheesh just bringing her a smoothie how can you fall for her lameness she's just a showoff unlike twilight the great and powerful trixie vanquished an ursa major can your twilight claim that oh really were you guys actually there well uh no but but nothing the proof is in the pudding i like pudding look unless an ursa major comes waltzing up the street for trixie to vanquish i am not gonna believe a word she says and neither should you and ursa walking up the street ay snails you thinking what i'm thinking why is it they call it a flea market when they don't really sell fleas yeah uh oh come on twilight would you put down that book and just listen to me didn't you see how they hated trixie's bragging spike if i go out there and show off my magic i run the risk of losing them as friends it's not the same thing twilight you'd be using your magic to stand up for your friends no spike it's exactly the same come on twilight any one of these tricks even the tiniest would be enough to show off trixie i don't wanna be seen as a bragger like trixie but you're the best please spike i said no if that's what you wanna be then fine oooh how we gonna find an ursa major when i can't even see my own hoof in front of my face hold on oh that's better hey guys where are you going can't talk now got a major problem yeah ursa major to be exact trixie twilight trixie come out you gotta help trixie thought she said the great and powerful trixie did not wanna be disturbed we we have a a tiny problem actually it's a big one what is so important that you cannot wait until morning to disturb trixie twilight you've gotta come quick i've already told you spike i don't wanna show off trixie no you don't understand it's uh is that what i think it is majorly great and powerful trixie you've got to vanquish the ursa yeah vanquish so we can watch it took a lotta trouble to get that thing here wait you brought this here are you out of your little pony minds but you're the great and powerful trixie yeah remember you defeated an ursa major uh okay stand back piece a cake oh come on trixie stop goofing around and vanquish it eh well that was a dud yeah pfft come on where's all the cool explosions and smoking stuff like earlier you know what's going on we brought an ursa to town you what don't worry the great and powerful trixie will vanquish it i can't what oh i can't i never have no one can vanquish an ursa major i just made the whole story up to make me look better made it up nice use of number ## call me dontcha know that's new unbelievable that was amazing heavens to betsy we knew you had ability but not that much i'm sorry please please don't hate me hate you why what ever do you mean darling well i know how much you all hated trixie's showing off with her magic tricks and i just thought whoah whoah whoah magic's got nothing to do with it trixie's just a loud mouth most unpleasant all hat no cattle so you don't mind my magic tricks your magic is a part of who you are sugar cube and we like who you are we're proud to have such a powerful talented unicorn as our friend and after whupping that ursa's hind quarters we're even prouder you are wow twilight how'd you know what to do with that ursa major that's what i was doing when you came looking for me i was so intrigued by trixie's bragging that i was compelled to do a little reading up on them so it is possible to vanquish an ursa major all by yourself that wasn't an ursa major it was a baby an ursa minor that was just a baby and it wasn't rampaging it was just cranky because someone woke it up if that was an ursa minor then what's an ursa major like you don't wanna know huh you may have vanquished an ursa minor but you will never have the amazing showstopping ability of the great and powerful trixie why that little just let her go maybe some day she'll learn her lesson now about you two oh we're sorry that we woke up the ursa minor we just wanted to see some awesome magic yeah and the way you vanquished that ursa minor was awesome we deserve whatever punishment you give us for starters you can clean up this mess and what do you think spike should i give them number ## oh twenty five yes and i think i deserve it too i think you're right sweet dear princess celestia i have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship i was so afraid of being thought of as a showoff that i was hiding a part of who i am my friends helped he realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off especially when you're standing up for your friends so you finally admit that you're the most talented unicorn in all of ponyville well yeah but it's nothing to brag about so uh how did it go with rarity eh she didn't go for the mustache you know spike that mustache has nothing to do with who you really are maybe you should just try being yourself or maybe the mustache wasn't enough maybe if i had a mustache and a beard ugh not this again okay imagine me with a nice long fu manchu-type beard or maybe a goatee oh no a soul patch where are you takin us we're almost there yearlings i've never been here before ouch oh sorry are we there yet there where what i don't even know what we're doing here we are what are we lookin at i have no idea

carousel boutique is she still here we heard fluttershy was here sorry you just missed her but you're still in luck i'm having a huge sale of some of my best designs and you are rarity of course never

photo finish i'm so sorry to interrupt it's just that i'm running late how could i have forgotten your appearance at the ballet opening everypony who is anypony will be there oh actually i'm supposed to be meeting my friend we go my hooves are getting positively pruney i've been waiting here so long obviously fluttershy's just too busy with her new career to spend time with her best friend i'm sure she just got tied up of course she did she's a big bright shining star i wish that star would burn out rarity fluttershy is your friend i know i know and i should be happy for her but instead i'm just jealous oh please promise you won't tell her i feel this way please please pleasepleaseplease you have my word losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend forever wow you look great fluttershy may be the one who's famous but that doesn't mean i have to stop looking fabulous rarity i'm so sorry i'm oh no she's already gone isn't she sorry oh i can't believe this i am so frustrated i could just scream feel better no can i tell you something of course you promise not to tell rarity i swear pinkie pie-swear cross my heart and hope to fly stick a cupcake in my aargh i don't like being a model no i hate being a model all this attention is awful just awful and i'm only doing it because rarity told me i must i must i must i must oh really well if you wanna know the truth rarity oh what were you about to say forever nothing i was just thinking if you really don't like being a model you could always quit oh no i could never do such a thing rarity would be devastated but rarity told me mmm juicy oh if only all these ponies didn't like me so much photo finish wouldn't want me to model anymore she'd find somepony else with the magic i guess you're right you're right you're right you're fight you're right it's fluttershy don't you see on her own fluttershy could never do something unattractive but if i used my magic to help her do something unattractive on her next fashion show no one would ever want her to model again and if fluttershy no longer has to be a model rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her and i'll no longer have to keep their secrets it's the perfect plan you can't tell anyone about it promise me you won't tell anyone s-s-so you do promise or you don't uh yes obviously that's why i zipped my mouth closed then locked it with a key then dug a hole then buried the key then built a house up top the hole where i buried the key then moved into the house atop the hole obviously you really think it'll work they love you for being you so all i have to do is make you not be you just leave it to me guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about oh no get her off the stage she's an embarrassment to all things fashion i photo finish have made a terrible mistake bravo i say bravo bravo who could possibly say bravo to that horrid display such attitude such pizzazz she's invented an entirely new kind of modeling bravo who is saying these things it's her the unicorn in the gorgeous cape and headdress now that is a pony who clearly knows a thing or two about fashion well if that fabulous pony likes it then i do too bravo this is awful just awful somehow i've become more popular than ever oh i'm so frustrated i could just kick something if only rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly but rarity fluttershy are you all right i'm great i'm a super famous fashion model why wouldn't i be great because you ha out there on the runway everyone was turning on you and oh oh fluttershy it's so awful i wanted them to you did of course she did because i'm jealous i wanted all the attention and instead it was going to you i even started hoping that you would do something silly so your modeling career would be over but then when it started happening all i could think was how could i want you to fail at something you love so much but fluttershy doesn't ugh love oh rarity i hate being a model you do more than anything then why did you keep doing it i was afraid if i quit you'd me mad at me for not wanting to shine all over equestria and i thought if i told you how jealous i was of your success you'd think i was a terrible friend never all this time if we just told each other the truth i promise never to keep my feelings in secret again me too cross my heart and hope to fly stick a cupcake in my eye you were brilliant brilliant i've already got six photo shoots lined up for tomorrow aloon i'm sorry photo finish but i don't think i'll be able to make any of them wat we go vat has just happened spike has a crush on rarity and you were doing so well now this is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon isn't it though dear princess celestia being a good friend means being able to keep a secret but you should never be afraid to share your true feelings with a good friend did you get all that spike no i did not i still can't believe you told someone about my secret feelings for rarity

shame on you braeburn listen somth'n terrible's happened terrible is right your train is full seven minutes late that's seven minutes less for you to delight in the pleasures and wonders of aaappleloosa boggles the mind we settler ponies built all this in just a past year don't it and as you can see we have all of the finest comforts like horse-drawn carriages okay you pull now eh we just switched and now's there horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages listen braeburn i the salt block that's enough salt for you can't i at least get a glass of water over there is the office of sheriff silverstar and here's where we have our wild west dances and here's where we have our mild west dances but braeburn we and here is the most wonderful sight in all of aaappleloosa our apple orchard braeburn first harvest should be any day now braebu good thing too brae cause we need that grub to live on braeburn uh yes cous you have a very nice town n all but we have a huuuge problem some of our friends are missin a stampede of buffalo the took spike rainbow dash went after them and we can't find pinkie pie and we had an apple tree with us for your orchard but they took that too did you say buffalo dem buffalo they want us settler ponies to take every single tree you see here off this land they sure as hay don't want any new ones added in but why beats me we put a lotta hard work into this land so we could feed our town our families our foals and now they're sayin all these trees have to go t'ain't fair oh i can't wait to get my hooves on that little buffalo nobody tricks rainbow dash and get away with it boo pinkie pie oh you caught me looks like i tricked you and didn't get away either you're good shh what do you think you're doing you gotta get out of here i do you're gonna blow my cover i am i'm trying to save spike oh my gosh so am i and the more of us there are out here the more chance is of us getting caught run pinkie i'll hold them off save yourself stop dash pinkie sup hey no worries i know those guys they're cool if you say so spike catch ya later bro seems they took me by mistake and they feel awful about it too poor guys fortunately they totally respect dragons so they treat me like an honored guest still don't like ponies much though but you're with me so it's cool huh why i still don't trust them i say we turn tail and bail while we still before we finish eating are you a loco in the coco can i please have more of that mushy stuff whatever it was certainly and mr spike you like gemstones yes turquoise mmm this here's little strongheart and these are my friends pinkie pie and rainbow dash you you that's it we are outta here wait please accept my apologies for what happened on the train we didn't mean for anyone to be hurt yeah right we only wanted the tree the settler ponies have overtaken the land and have planted an orchard all over it because of their thoughtlessness we can no longer run over our traditional stampeding grounds huh i think it's time they've met chief thunderhooves we have a long and winding stampeding trail which we run upon for many generations my father stampeded upon these grounds and his father before him and his father before him and his father before him and his father before him and i think they get the idea chief it is a sacred tradition to run the path every year but these year these settler ponies these appleloosans they planted apple trees all over it without asking our permission well that's not very nice right rainbow dash the ponies refused to move their trees so we are stuck here and it is not fair see rainbow dash they had a good reason to i'll say they had a good reason come on we have some apple-picking appleloosans to talk to gently please sorry rarity but our friends are out there and we have to be ready for a long hike into buffalo territory if we're gonna save them let's go hi guys pinkie we're so glad you're safe how did you escape from the buffalo we didn't we promised the buffalo a chance to talk oh yeah bout what we brought our new pal little strongheart here to explain to the appleloosans why they should move the apple trees off buffalo land that information would be quite help that's weird cause my cousin braeburn here wants to explain to the buffalo why they should let the apple trees stay that would a useful thing to the land is theirs you planted the trees not knowing that honest mistake now you just gotta move em that's all well heh they busted their rumps here and now they're supposed to bust their rumps again just cause some buffalo won't stampede someplace else plant the trees somewhere else where it's the only flat land around these parts the buffalo had it first the settler ponies need it to live look both the settlers and the buffalo have good reasons to use this land there must be something we can do hey i've got an idea we may be divided but of you all i beg to remember we're all hoofed at the end of each leg no matter what the issue come from wherever you please all this fighting gets you nothing but hoof-and-mouth disease arguing's not the way hey come out and play it's a shiny new day so what do you say you gotta shaaare you gotta caaare it's a right thing to do you gotta shaaare you gotta caaare and there'll always be a way through both our diets i should mention are completely vegetarian we all eat hay and oats why be at each other's throat you gotta shaaare you gotta caaare it's a right thing to do and there'll always be a way throoough alright pinkie pie that was fantastic what a great song you're right on it appears that sheriff silverstar and i have come to an agreement we have that was the worst performance we've ever seen absotively the time for action is upon us our stampede will start at high noon tomorrow and if the orchard is still there we'll flatten it and the whole town but chief and we appleloosans say you better bring your best cause we'll be ready and waitin but sheriff oh that wasn't the message of my song at all i want my kin to have what they need to live but a storm's a-brewin here and i don't like the look of it we've just got to talk some sense into them before somepony gets hurt listen maybe if you would just reconsider we about the trees now if you just if we could just sit down and talk we could why won't anybody be rational and reasonable sheriff if we could only isn't there some way to stop this unless the settlers remove those trees i do not think so i know you don't wanna do this but they have taken our land what would you have me do rainbow dash i don't know but it's never too late to think of something at noon it will be too late come on think thinkthinkthinkthinkthinkthinkthink he's not gonna do it you gotta shaaare you gotta caaare it's a right thing to do you gotta shaaare chaaarge ready aim fire yum hey i've got a much better idea we will allow the apple orchard to stay in exchange for a share of its fruit those delicious apple pies i'd rather eat turquoise any day of the week bloomberg this is your special day mama's so proud of you dear princess celestia friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing even the worst of enemies can become friends you need understanding and compromise you've got to share you've got to care hey that's what i said not too fast now angel bunny you don't wanna get a tummy ache you really should eat

spreading over all of equestria that's what i've been trying to but don't worry i've just received a letter from princess celestia informing me that it is not coming from a fire oh thank goodness it's coming from a dragon a d-d-d-dragon what in the name of all things cinnamon swirled is a full-grown dragon doin here in equestria sleeping according to princess celestia he's taking a nap his snoring

mountain i'm gonna fly up there and check it out hold on now i think we should all go up together safety in numbers and all oh all right i hear the only thing that sparkles more than the dragon's scales are the jewels they use to build their nests if i play my cards right i might be able to convince him to part with a few welcome to my cave rarity care for a diamond girls this is no laughing matter fluttershy you're the expert on wild creatures what do you think the dragon will be like fluttershy hey what are you waiting for an invitation ooo i think i have one in my bag it it's so so

take her around the mountain another way uh around the mountain that's gonna take them forever don't worry twi we'll be there lickety split woohoo i win again ugh that's thirty-five games in a row best of seventy-one we made it told you it was gonna take them forever your turn fluttershy but it's so wide come on fluttershy we should be much farther along by now you could just leap on over i i don't know there's nothing to be afraid of it's just a hop skip and a jump see it's not very far just move your little rump you can make it if you try with a hop skip and jump we don't have time for this a hop skip and jump just move your little rump a hop skip and jump a hop skip and jump ahopskipandjump ahopskipandjump ahopskipandjump okay here i go a hop that's it you're almost there skip just don't look down i guess i forgot to jump let's keep it down according to my map we're entering an avalanche zone the smallest peep could cause a huge rockslide an an ava ava shhh avala oh no help everypony okay thanks to you i am let's do it again this is why a girl always packs extra accessories oh please tell me i brought a tiara that goes with this i think we've got bigger problems than making sure our hair bows match our horseshoes sorry oh no big whoop sugar cube yeah we'll just have to climb over my apologies not your fault still think it was a good idea to bring fluttershy along we're about to find out we're here rainbow dash you'll use your wings to clear the smoke rarity and pinkie pie you create a diversion to distract the dragon if things get a little hairy in there applejack you're ready with the apples in case he decides to attack but it shouldn't come to that because fluttershy will do what she needs to do to wake him up and between the two of us we should be able to get him to understand why he needs to go is everypony ready okay then we're going in so what is the best way to wake up a sleeping dragon without upsetting him fluttershy oh come on come on we have to do this now every second longer that dragon sleeps is another acre of equestria that is covered in smoke i i i can't go in the cave oh great she's scared of caves now too i'm not scared of caves i'm scared of what's that sugar cube i'm scared of d what i'm scared of dragons but fluttershy you have a wonderful talent dealing with all kinds of animals yes because they're not dragons oh come on we've seen you walk right up to a horrible manticore like it was nothing yes because he wasn't a dragon spike is a dragon you're not scared of him yes because he's not a huge gigantic terrifying enormous teeth-gnashing sharp-scale-having horn-wearing smoke-snoring could-eat-a-pony-in-one-bite totally all grown up dragon but if you're so afraid of dragons why didn't you say something before we came all the way up here i was afraid to all of us are scared of that dragon i'm not almost all of us are scared of that dragon but we've got a job to do so get in there with twilight and show her what you're made of i i i just can't oh fluttershy i'm going in he probably just doesn't realize what he's doing right mister dragon excuse me mister dragon oh good you're awake please allow me to introduce myself my name is twilight sparkle and my friends and i are residents here in equestria ponyville to be exact we come here to ask that you find another spot to take your nap it just that you seem to be doing an awful lot of snoring and every time you do you send out a terrible cloud of smoke equestria simply can't survive a hundred years in a dark haze you understand don't you so you'll find another place to sleep so much for persuading him now what obviously this situation just calls for a little pony charm allow me girls i'm so sorry to interru-hupt but i couldn't possibly head back home without mentioning what handsome scales you have and those scales have to be hidden away in some silly cave for a hundred years personally i think you should skip the snoozing and be out there showing them off obviously i would be more than happy to keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone i was this close to getting that diamond you mean getting rid of that dragon oh yeah sure what in tarnation darling you look ridiculous exactly sharing a laugh is a sure-fire way to get someone on your side hi apparently he doesn't like laughing heh or sharing alright that's it we've tried persuasion charm whatever it is pinkie pie does it's time to stop wasting time i'm going in rainbow no get out sorry how dare you how dare you listen here mister just because you're big doesn't mean you get to be a bully you may have huge teeth and sharp scales and snore-smoke and breathe fire but you do not i repeat you do not hurt my friends you got that well but that rainbow one kicked me and i am very sorry about that but you're bigger than she is and you should know better you should also know better than to take a nap where your snoring can become a health hazard to other creatures but i don't you but i me mister now what do you have to say for yourself i said what do you have to say for yourself there there no need to cry you're not a bad dragon you've just made a bad decision now go pack your things you'll just need to find a new place to sleep that's all you did it i knew you could do it i said come back here how does fluttershy put up with you furry little things spike take a letter with pleasure dear princess celestia i am happy to report that the dragon has departed our fair country and that it was my good friend fluttershy who convinced

hear that you have an extra ticket yeah but yes this is so awesome the wonderbolts perform at the grand galloping gala every year i can see it now everyone will be watching the sky their eyes riveted on the wonderbolts but then in would fly rainbow dash i would draw their attention with my super speed strut then i would mesmerize them with my fantastic filly flash and for my grand finale the buccaneer blaze the ponies would go wild the wonderbolts would insist that my signature moves be incorporated into their routine and then welcome me as their newest member don't you see twilight this could be my one chance to show em my stuff you gotta take me hold on just one pony pickin minute here i asked for that ticket first so that doesn't mean you own it oh yeah well i challenge you to a hoof wrestle winner gets the ticket girls these are my tickets i'll decide who gets it thank you very much whoever has the best reason to go should get the ticket don't you think drummin up business

wonderful terrifically humongous party in all of equestria i've always always always wanted to go oh the grand galloping gala is the best place for me oh the grand galloping gala is the best place for me hip hip hurray it's the best place for me for pinkie with decorations and streamers and fairy lights and pinwheels and pi atas and pincushions with goodies like sugar cubes and sugar canes and sundaes and sunbeams and sasparilla and i get to play my favoritest of favorite fantabulous games like pin the tail on the pony oh the grand galloping gala is the best place for me oh the grand galloping gala is the best place for me cause it's the most gallerific superly-teriffic gala ever in the whole galaxy whee oh thank you twilight it's the most wonderfulest gift ever um actually are these what i think they are yes yes yes twilight's taking my to the grand galloping gala in canterlot the gala i design ensembles for the gala every year but i've never had the opportunity to attend oh the society the culture the glamor it's where i truly belong and where i'm destined to meet him him who him i would stroll through the gala and everyone would wonder who is that mysterious mare they would never guess that i was just a simple pony from little old ponyville why i would cause such a sensation that i would be invited for an audience with princess celestia herself and the princess would be so taken with the style and elegance that she would introduce me to him her nephew the most handsome eligible unicorn stallion in canterlot our eyes would meet our hearts would melt our courtship would be magnificent he would ask for my hoof in marriage and of course i would say yes we would have a royal wedding befitting a princess which is what i would become upon marrying him the stallion of my dreams twilight i simply cannot believe you would invite pinkie pie so she could party and prevent me from meeting my true love how could you hey angel these are perfect listen guys i haven't decided who to give the extra ticket to you haven't um excuse me twilight i would just like to ask i mean if it would be all right if you haven't given it to someone else you you want to go to the gala oh no i mean yes or actually kind of you see it's not so much the grand galloping gala as it is the wondrous private gated garden that surrounds the dance the flowers are said the be the most beautiful and fragrant in all of equestria for the night of the gala and that night alone will they all be in bloom and that's just the flora don't get me started on the fauna there's loons and toucans and bitterns oh my hummingbirds that can really hum and buzzards that can really buzz and blue jays and red jays and green jays pink jays and pink flamingos gee fluttershy it sounds beautiful wait just a minute rainbow dash were you following me no i mean yes i mean maybe look it doesn't matter i couldn't risk a goody four-shoes like you giving that ticket away to just anybody wait just another minute applejack were you following me too no i was following this one to make sure she didn't try any funny business still tryin to take my ticket your ticket but twilight's taking me quiet and then i said oatmeal are you craz oh girls there's no use in arguing but twilight this is my decision and i'm gonna make it on my own and i certainly can't think straight with all this noise not to mention hunger now go on shoo and don't worry i'll figure this out somehow oh spike what am i gonna do all five of my best friends have really good reasons to go to the gala applejack rainbow dash pinkie pie or fluttershy rarity oh who should go with me have you made your decision i can't decide twilight he just wants to take your order oh i would love a daffodil and daisy sandwich do you have any rubies no okay i'll have the hay fries extra crispy what do you think spike i think we have to try another restaurant i mean i like grass just fine but would it hurt anybody to offer some gemstones i mean about the gala and the ticket and who i should take oh you're still on that spike listen how do i choose and when i do choose will the other four be mad at me i mean i could give up my ticket and give away two but that would still leave three disappointed ponies what if i ah your food oh thank you this looks so good i'm sure everything will be much clearer once i eat um madame are you going to eat your food in ze rain it's not raining what's going on hi there best friend forever i've ever ever had enjoying the sunny weather rainbow dash what are you doing whadya mean i just saw the smartest most generous pony about to get rained on so i though i'd kick a hole in the clouds to keep her dry so she can dine at peace that's all rainbow you're not trying to get extra consideration for the extra ticket by doing the extra special favors are you me no no no of course not seriously i'd do it for anypony rainbow i am not comfortable accepting unwanted favors so i'd appreciate if you closed up that rain cloud right now fine that's better twilight it's raining no really come with me before you catch a cold oops sorry oh no it's quite all right after all we are the best of friends are we not and you know what the best of friends do makeover ugh rarity there oh you're simply darling yeah it is kinda pretty isn't it and you oh spike i have a dandy little outfit

fabulous you'll look at the grand galloping gala wait the grand and oh my goodness what a coincidence i happen to have an ensemble of my own that matches yours to a tee we would be the belles of the ball you and i everyone would be clamoring for our attention all eyes would be on us and then everyone would finally know the most beautiful most talented most sophisticated pony in all of equestria is rarity the unicorn and twilight sparkle of course i see what's going on you're just buttering me up so i give you the extra ticket well it's not gonna work you're going to have to wait for my decision just like everyone else now if you'll excuse me i've been trying all day just to get some lunch did somepony say lunch you've got to be kidding me i got apple pie apple fritters apple tarts apple dumplings apple crisps apple crumbles aaand apple brown betty the dessert not my auntie what'd ya say there best friend is that a yes no no i don't know who i'm giving the ticket to and all these favors aren't making it any easier to decide in fact i'm less sure now than i was this morning aaargh so that's a maybe i never thought being showered with favors would be so aggravating fluttershy not you too oh well hello twilight i hope you don't mind but we're all doing a little spring cleaning for you it's summer oh well better late than never right it was angel's idea you're not doing this for the ticket are you oh no i'm doing this because you're my very best friend right angel yes we are just doing this for the ticket no no no well this is all very nice of you and angel but i'm not accepting any extra favors until i've made my final decision so i'm going to have to ask you to leave surprise twilight is my bestest friend whoopee whoopee pinkie she's the cutest smartest all-around best pony pony pinkie i bet if i throw a super-duper fun party party pinkie she'll give her extra ticket to the gala to meee pinkieee yes twilight at least the other ponies try to be subtle about the ticket wait what ticket what gala oh you didn't know twilight has an extra ticket to the grand galloping gala the grand galloping gala have i ever told you how much i love your mane i'll wash your dishes would you like any help with your gardening i have a cartload of extra carrots what are we gonna do we're gonna ruuuun warn me next time you're gonna do that i didn't even know it was gonna happen not quick lock the doors i can't decide i just can't decide it's important to all of you and i just can't stand to disappoint any of you and giving me gifts and doing me favors won't make any difference because you're all my friends and i wanna make you all happy and i can't i just can't twilight sugar i didn't mean to put so much pressure on you and if it helps i don't want the ticket anymore you can give it to somepony else i won't feel bad i promise me too i feel just awful that i made you feel so awful and me too it's no fun upsetting your friends twilight it was unfair of me to try to force you as i did yes that means the ticket is mine i've got the ticket i've got the ticket you know i haven't perfected my signature moves for the wonderbolts anyway i don't need that ticket either we all got so gung-ho about going to the gala that we couldn't see how ungung-ho we were makin you we're sorry twilight spike take down a note dear princess celestia i've learned that one of the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings but when it's not enough blessings to go around having more than your friends can make you feel pretty awful so though i appreciate the invitation i will be returning both tickets to the grand galloping gala what if my friends can't all go i don't wanna go either twilight you don't have to do that nope i've made up my mind spike you can send the letter now now you won't get to go to the gala either it's okay girls i couldn't possibly enjoy myself without my best friends there with me so i'd rather not go at all well wallop my withers spike isn't that just like a boy can't handle the least bit of sentiment whoah nelly a letter from the princess that was fast my faithful student twilight why didn't you just say so in the first place six tickets to the grand galloping gala now we can all go allow us to treat you to dinner what a great way to apologise and to celebrate come on everyone the cupcakes are on me how come i don't get a ticket to the gala and one for you spike i mean gross i have to go too now what have we learned lots of control good screaming and hollering yes and most importantly passion right so now that you know the elements of a good cheer let's hear one yay you're gonna cheer for me like that louder yay louder yay louder yaaay too loud yay and now phase one of my routine woo phase two way to go here we go phase three the sonic rainboom come on uh-oh last one thank you so much for helping me clean up all these books guys it was a crazy weekend of studying rainbow dash you rock woohoo did my cheering do that sorry about that ladies that was a truly feeble performance actually it wasn't all bad i particularly liked it when you made the clouds spin i'm not talking about my performance i'm talking about yours that feeble cheering what are you two arguing about were we arguing i'm sorry i wish you guys could come to cloudsdale to see me competing in the best young flyer competition what's that it's where all the greatest pegasus flyers get together and show off their different flying styles some are fast and some are graceful golly i'd love to see you strut your stuff in that competition yeah i wish you guys could be there fluttershy is a great support but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational ooh i'd love to see you make a sonic rainboom it's like the most coolest thing ever even though i've never actually seen it but i mean come on it's a sonic rainboom how not cool could it possibly not be what's a sonic rainboom you really need to get out more the sonic rainboom is legendary when a pegasus like rainbow dash gets going so fast boom a sonic boom and a rainbow can happen all at once and rainbow dash here's the only pony to ever pull it off it was a long time ago i was just a filly yeah but you're gonna do it again right a-are you kidding i'm the greatest flyer to ever come out of cloudsdale i could do sonic rainbooms in my sleep wow if you pull that off you'll win the crown for sure the grand prize is an entire day with the wonderbolts a whole day of flying with my lifelong heroes it'll be a dream come true yay i'm gonna go rest up don't wanna overprepare myself you know you on the other hand better keep practicing i need a cheering section to match my spectacular performance she's practiced that move a hundred times and she's never even come close to doing it i don't know if i can cheer loud enough to help her well guess we better get this cleaned up again go on go on go on what find a spell that will get us wingless ponies into cloudsdale didn't you see how nervous she was nervous have you spit your bit or someth'n she was tootin her own horn louder than the brass section of a marchin band oh please i've put on enough fashion shows to recognize stage fright when i see it you've got to find a way to be there for her now go on how am i supposed to find a flight spell in this mess a flight spell one sec page ## how'd you do that it landed on my face when rainbow dash knocked me into the bookcase here it is a spell that will allow earth ponies to fly for three days ooh it looks really difficult i'm not sure i can do it you've got to try okay but who's gonna volunteer to be the test subject i will for rainbow dash i will go first here goes i think it worked you've got to learn to be assertive fluttershy don't be afraid to speak up well well well what do we have here it's our old friend rainbow crash get kicked out of any flight schools lately i didn't get kicked out face it rainbow crash flight school had too many rules and not enough naptimes for you huh ask her about the sonic rainboom that's nothing but an old mares tale you don't have the skills to try something like that now wait just a minute oh i'm sorry i'm trying to be more assertive anyhow she is going to do a sonic rainboom no she's not cause there's no such thing the show up at the cloudiseum and see for yourself if you're free yeah i'll be free oh don't worry we'll be there see you then rainbow crash did you see that i was so assertive those guys are right i'll never be able to do it but rainbow dash just because you failed the sonic rainboom a hundred thousand times in practice doesn't mean you won't be able to do it in front of an entire stadium full of impatient super-critical sports fan ponies what do i do everypony's gonna see me fail the wonderbolts will never let a loser like me join princess celestia will probably banish me to the everfree forest my life is ruined rar rare the sonic rainboom is way more than rare rarity rarity are you flying i most certainly am aren't my wings smashing twilight made them for me i just adore them why so shocked we couldn't leave our favorite flyer without a big cheering section we i i can't believe it it's incredible this is so cool you guys made it sure did wait how'd you do that only pegasus ponies can walk on clouds pretty cool huh i found a spell that makes temporary wings but it was too difficult to do more than once so i found an easier spell that lets the rest of us walk on clouds and we came to cheer you to victory to be honest i was starting to get just a teeniest tiniest bit nervous but i feel a lot better now that you guys are here hey we've got some time before the competition why don't fluttershy and i show you around cloudsdale here it is the greatest city in the sky some of the greatest pegasi in history came from cloudsdale oh wait for me those wings are gorgeous oh why thank you be careful with those wings rarity they're made from gossamer and morning dew and they're incredibly delicate don't worry twilight i'm sure they can't get worn out from too much attention since we're up here i'd sure like to get a look at where the weather's made great idea come on girls to the weather factory this is where they make the snowflakes each one is hoofmade as you could see it's a delicate operation ooh the snowflakes look even better from up here we better move on before rarity ruins winter and causes a drought and here's where they make the rainbows spicy yeah rainbows aren't really known for their flavor where'd you get those amazing wings i want a pair yeah i guess i could see that oh hey look it's rainbow crash again yeah rainbow crash rarity what are you doing talking to these guys oh they were just admiring my wings rainbow dash yeah you should forget the sonic rainboom and just get yourself some wings like these oh come on girls why don't we go see how clouds are made don't listen to them you're gonna win that competition for sure are you kidding i can't do the sonic rainboom and just look at these boring plain old feathered wings i'm doomed why these old things go ahead everypony photos are encouraged rarity we're supposed to be helping rainbow dash relax remember put your wings away and stop showing off oh how can you ask me to put away perfection rainbow dash are you okay you don't look so good of course why wouldn't i be okay everyone's so in love of rarity's wings that they won't even notice when i totally blow it in the best young flyer's competition hey there's an idea you should enter the competition yeah i could watch you fly all day long there really isn't anypony who uses their wings quite like me perhaps i should compete what what am i gonna do i'll never win the competition now i'm going to be a while fillies and gentlecolts please rise and join me in welcoming our beloved princess celestia please welcome our celebrity judges for the best young flyer competition the wonderbolts and now let's find out who

i'm starved stay right where you are all i want is a clear path to the exit nobody move and my dress won't get hurt stay back back i say well spike i don't know for sure how things went with the princess but at least no big disasters happened oh you poor little thing how did you ever get in such bad condition don't you worry philomena i'll nurse you back to health as a favor to the princess who's obviously just far too busy to care for you properly i'm sure the princess will appreciate the help oh my we'd better get you to bed right away there this is far worse than i thought what you need is some medicine stat here you go philomena this will fix you right up doctor fluttershy expected that always works uh almost always there's nothing like home-made soup to cure what ails you come on now you're not gonna get better if you don't cooperate mmm see it's delicious good and good for you here come the choo-choo train chugga-chugga chugga-chugga whoo-whoo oh dear don't worry philomena i know what'll make you feel better wait right here i have just the thing look philomena i brought a fellow feathered friend by to cheer you up hummingway here was sick once too but he let me help him and got better in no time didn't you boy say hello to your new friend philomena aw look i think he likes you your turn now philomena go ahead you can do it um good try i know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat a humidifier refreshing how's that feeling now for you philomena better oh that's okay i know lots of other ways to take care of you don't worry you're gonna get better how about aromatherapy warm bath ointment scalpel surgical tape feathers oh philomena i thought it would be easy to nurse you back to health i've tried everything i know and look at you you're worse than ever hi fluttershy i just wanted to drop by and say thank you so very much for making such a good impression on the princess today what is celestia's pet doing here i couldn't leave the poor thing there she needed my help oh no nonononononono this is bad how could i just walk away and not do anything but but she doesn't belong to you i had to do something without telling anypony without asking permission but i know you had good intentions but you have got to return princess's pet but you're right okay let's go if we hurry we can put her back before anypony even realizes she's missing we were told we could find twilight sparkle here we regret to inform you miss that the royal pet has gone missing really you don't say it's that dry night air but it's daytime well day air's even drier you guards better be on your way if you're gonna find the princess's missing pet philomena was it thank you ever so much for keeping me in the loop bye what are you doing going to return philomena remember we can't now why not you have no idea what the princess is gonna do if she finds you're the one who took her pet do you do you well no but it can't be anything good she might banish you from equestria or throw you in a dungeon or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon in the place that she banishes you to you really think the princess would do that okay granted that probably won't happen but do you wanna take any chances all that really matters to me is that poor little philomena here gets well that's very noble of you i'll write to you when you're banished unless i'm banished too somewhere there's no post office then you'll have to write to me deal please twilight you just have to help me get philomena healthy and then we can return her to the princess and everything will be fine did you give her any kind of medicine i tried to but she wouldn't take it then you have to make her take it you can't be such a pushover fluttershy you need to show this patient who's the boss make her straighten up and fly right she can't fly no excuses done okay what else uh well she keeps pulling her feathers off the ones that haven't fallen out yet from all her coughing i mean there you go i don't think she likes it tough love baby you want her to get well don't you of course but next well she desperately needs some bed rest but i can't get her to stay put one step ahead of you it's for your own good philomena i promise please just relax and try to get some sleep what's this soup over here smells delicious i made it for philomena but she wouldn't eat it oh she'll eat it all right hey where are you going no philomena come back what are you two doing are you having a race oh can i play ###go excuse me hi beg your pardon put me down what in tarnation sorry but we've gotta find the princess's pet bird philomena come down from there you'll hurt yourself i'll catch you what is going on here twilight yes your majesty there's been a terrible accident it's all my fault no princess fluttershy didn't know any better it was my fault i'm the one who did it but you were only trying to help some help i was will ya let me do this she'll go easier on me but it's my fault no it's my fault no it's my fault wait what are we talking about thanks for trying to protect me twilight but princess celestia i'm the one who took your pet bird i really was only trying to help the poor little thing then i was gonna bring it back to you honest so if you wanna banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to then that's what i deserve oh stop fooling around philomena you're scaring everypony i don't understand what is that thing what happened to philomena this is philomena she's quite a sight as i said but nothing unusual for a phoenix isn't that right philomena a a phoenix a phoenix is a majestic and magical bird while it appears healthy and happy most of the time every so often it must renew itself by shedding all of its feathers and bursting into flame rather melodramatic if you ask me it then rises from the ashes fresh as a daisy all just a normal part of the life cycle of a phoenix i'm afraid mischievous little philomena here took the occasion to have a little fun with you fluttershy say you're sorry young lady so aren't you gonna banish me or throw me in a dungeon or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to of course not my little pony where on earth would you get such an idea i guess i have some imagination fluttershy really did do everything she could to try to take care of philomena for you and i do appreciate that your heart was in the right place child but all you had to do was ask me and i could have told you philomena was a phoenix and saved you all this trouble i know i shouldn't have jumped to conclusions next time i'll ask before taking matters into my own hooves should i write you a letter about that lesson princess no that's quite all right i think i can remember it's beautiful thank you philomena no hard feelings yes oh opalescence can you just picture it moi stepping up in astounding new gown at the grand galloping gala in canterlot why yes i did make it myself thank you so much for asking oh opal of course you can help me thank you what's that you wanna help me more oh aren't you the sweetest thing careful now don't move this shouldn't take

serious applejack you absolutely must wear formal attire nah what if i just spruce up your duds for you a little bit okay sure why not since you're up for it and all just don't make them too

wonderful boost for my business plus fun oh i love fun things then it's settled we'll have a fashion show starring us so all you have to do is make a different stunning original amazing outfit for one two three four five plus yourself six ponies and lickety split oh applejack you make it sound as if it's going to be hard thread by thread stitching it together twilight's dress cutting out the pattern snip by snip making sure the fabric folds nicely it's the perfect color and so hip always gotta keep in mind my pacing making sure the cloth's correctly facing i'm stitching twilight's dress yard by yard fussing on the details jewel neckline don't you know a stitch in time saves nine make her something perfect to inspire even though she hates formal attire gotta mind those intimate details even though she's more concerned with sales it's applejack's new dress dressmaking's easy for pinkie pie something pink fluttershy something breezy blend color and form do you think it looks cheesy something brash perhaps quite fetching hook and eye couldn't you just simply die making sure it fits forelock and crest don't forget some magic in the dress even though it rides high on the flank rainbow won't look like a tank i'm stitching rainbow's dress piece by piece snip by snip croup dock haunch shoulders hip thread by thread primmed and pressed yard by yard never stressed and that's the art of the dress that's it keep them closed don't look okay you can look now these are your new outfits what do you think of your old duds now applejack pretty swanky are they not and twilight i made this dress for you and i designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality oh it took me forever to get the colors right on this one rainbow dash but i did it oh and it turned out beautiful don't you think ooo and i know you are going to love yours fluttershy it just sings spring and pinkie pie look pink your favorite aren't they all amazing wow they're yeah they're they sure are sumth'n yes something i love something something is my favorite it's nice but what's the matter don't you like them they're very nice and we're plum grateful cause you worked so hard on them mine's just not as cool as i was imagining she asked i guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind that's okay not a problem there's plenty more where that came from they were only a first pass you're my friends and i want you to be ### satisfied not to worry i'll redo them oh rarity you don't have to do that they're fine i want them to be better that just fine i want you to think they're absolutely perfect are you sure i mean we wouldn't wanna impose oh it's no really i insist well in that case thank you again rarity what have i gotten myself into hello you wanted to see me rarity fluttershy your new-new gown's ready i completely revised it and i know you're going to love it what do you think i love it oh you're just saying that no

no that's okay tell me no it's fine tell me i like it tell me tell me tellmetellmetellme all right since you really wanna know the arm's sized tight the middy collar doesn't go with the shawl lapel the hems are clearly machine-stitched the pleats are uneven the fabric looks like toile you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch and the overdesign is reminiscent of prt- porter and not true french haute couture but uh you know um whatever you want to do is fine now the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate orion has three stars on his belt not four stitch by stitch stitching it together deadline looms don't know the client's always right even if my fabric choice was perfect got to get them all done by tonight pinkie pie the color's too obtrusive wait until you see it in the light i'm sewing them together don't you think my gown would be more me with some lollipops well i think balloons well do eet hour by hour one more change i'm sewing them together take great pains fluttershy you're putting me in a bind rainbow dash what is on your mind oh my gosh there's simply not much time don't forget applejack's duds must shine dressmaking's easy every customer's call brings a whole new revision have to pick up the pace still hold to my vision that constellation is canis major not minor french haute couture please what if it rains galoshes more balloons oh no that's too many balloons more candy oh less candy oh wait i know streamers streamers whose dress is this streamers it is what aren't you going to tell me to change something too no i just want my dress to be cool do you not like the color the color's fine just make it look cooler do you not like the shape the shape's fine just make the whole thing you know cooler it needs to be about ## cooler all we ever want is indecision all we really like is what we know gotta balance style with adherence making sure we make a good appearance even if you simply have to fudge it make sure that it stays within our budget got to overcome intimidation remember it's all in the presentation piece by piece snip by snip croup dock haunch shoulders hip bolt by bolt primmed and pressed yard by yard always stressed and that's the art of the dress oh opal these are the ugliest dresses i've ever made okay i did exactly what each of you asked for now don't hold back let me know what you really think oh my it's perfect it's cool wow they're the best duds i ever did see it's exactly what i asked for thank you rarity are you as happy with the as we're well i'm happy

waiting decades no centuries for the perfect pony gown today at long last equestria your wait is over let's hear it for the breathtaking designs of ponyville's own rarity why's everypony lookin at us like that oh dear you think we overdid it nah okay maybe a little those amateurish designs look like a piled-on mishmash of everything but a kitchen sink it's a travesty it's what it is those outfits

forward show yourself bravo bravo magnifico oh boy oh thank you thank you oh thank you so much dear princess celestia this week my very talented friend rarity learned that if you try to please everypony you often times end up pleasing nopony especially yourself when somepony offers to do you a favor like making you a beautiful dress you shouldn't be overly critical of something generously given to you in other words you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth rarity my congratulations you are the most impressive fashion maven would you do me the great honor of allowing me to feature your couture in my best of the best boutique in canterlot now i'll need you to make a dozen of each dress for me by next tuesday hoowee not a bad pitch for a pony who works with her head in the clouds oh yeah think you can do better cowgirl i know i can oh for pete's sake heh looks like this pegasus can pitch better than the workhorse the object of the game is to get the closest to the stake alright alright you got another throw there pony girl wow rainbow heh you couldn't hit the barn door with that kind of a throw yeah yeah i still have the closest throw applesmack just try and beat it yeehaw it's a ringer that's how you do it down here on the farm i lost oh don't feel bad rainbow it's all in good fun i hate losing besides you're a mighty good athlete i'm just better heh heh heh

does this count fillies and gentlecolts at the halfway point our competitors are tied at # and # who are you talking to them ## ## ## ## ## a hundred yes be a good sport applejack all right you two this is the final event give it all you've got looks like the workhorse might come out ahead in this one that's not fair you can't use your wings to help you win you're cheatin i can't understand you with that rope in your mouth i said uh-oh i win by a landslide or mudslide in your case i am the iron pony only cos you cheated what you used your wingpower to help you win over half those contests sounds like sour apples to me are you sayin you didn't use your wings well no but you never said i couldn't use my wings i didn't think i needed to tell you to play fair i still would have won even without my wings hah prove it gladly how tomorrow's the annual runnin of the leaves i challenge you to race me in it heh easy shmeasy hold on the point is to run so no wings allowed no wings no problem twilight hurry up we're gonna be late for the race why are you so excited about the race it's only for ponies yeah but i'm hoping i can be the announcer again fillies and gentlecolts welcome to the annual running of the leaves this is pinkie pie your official eye-in-the-sky announcer sorry spike i guess that job's already taken as everypony know the running is very important tradition for without it the autumn leaves of equestria would never fall so get ready pony the running of the leaves will begin in # minutes pardon me excuse me make way for the iron pony the iron phony you mean so applejack you ready to win second place i'm ready to run a good clean race yeah yeah you are not allowed to use your wings i could win this race with both wings tied behind my back trussed up like a turkey well a turkey who can't fly that is very funny least now we know we're racin fair and square racers please take your position um pinkie pie hey spike what's up oh wait it me i'm up uh yeah uh i know you're doing the announcing today and stuff and i'm sure you're gonna do a great job and all but i was just wondering what uh forget it spike would you like to be my co-reporter we could comment on the action together we could climb on up twilight what in tarnation are you doin up here i'm racing good one twilight i'm not joking what you're not an athlete you're a well you're an egghead i am not an egghead i am well read egghead but ha have you ever run a race well no but i do know a lot about running and you know this from books i've read several on the subject what'd you read the egghead's guide to running di di did you stretch out your eye muscles to warm up ha ha ha ha get it eye muscles scoff if you must rainbow but the running of the leaves is a ponyville tradition and since i'm here to learn i've decided i should experience it myself well i think that's just dandy twilight good luck yeah see you at the finish line tomorrow all right ponies are you ready get set and they're off welcome to the official coverage of the running of the leaves you know spike despite its name the leaves don't do any of the actual running no that's left to my little ponies why yes pinkie it's the running of the ponies that causes the leaves to fall ugh those lazy lazy leaves but his year the run is about more than the weather it's about the race to the finish and the two runners want to win it applejack and rainbow dash you know pinkie these two ponies have a bit of a grudge match they're trying to settle trying to prove who's the most athletic yes and grudge rhymes with fudge yes it does what and i like fudge but if i eat too much fudge i get a pudge and then i can't budge so no fudge oh no thanks i had a big breakfast let's check in with our two competitive applejack and rainbow dash having come fast out of the gate applejack and rainbow dash are evenly matched running neck and neck but what's this applejack is making the move she's now ahead by a nose but rainbow dash pulls applejack up and takes the lead she's ahead by half a nose or maybe three quarters of a nose no about ##.# of a nose roughly speaking applejack sees this move and pushes forth with her strong workhorse legs slinking ahead by ### noses not so easy without wings is it come on rainbow show em a little dash ho-hold your horses pinkie rainbow dash is catching up the frontrunner applejack what an upset i thought applejack had this in the bag you didn't think i was gonna let you off that easy did you i don't believe it i know it's beautiful isn't it not the scenery twilight rainbow dash just tripped me she did not she did too she did not and if you slowed down and looked where you're going like me you'd see that you tripped over a rock what oh hayseed now i got a lot of ground to make up to catch rainbow just be careful see you at the finish line i don't believe it after a huge setback applejack is back at the front of the pack she's the head of the pack all right the pick of the litter the cat's pyjamas oh wait why would applejack take some poor kitty's pjs that's not very sporting of her oookay let's get back to the race not so fast applejack this race isn't over yet it is for you i don't believe it applejack tripped me don't you ponies ever look where you're going you tripped on a stump see oh i see a big cheater is what i see rainbow applejack would never cheat it was just an accident sure it was i mean yeah i'm sure it was remember rainbow this is just a game yes but the rules have changed and two can play at that game welcome back ponyvillians it's me pinkie pie and spike looks like rainbow's doing her best to catch up i'm not sure how ketchup is going to help her in this contest now in a hot dog eating contest it can make them doggies nice and slippery but personally i prefer mustard how about you spike uh i like pickles aaand it looks like applejack has found herself in quite a pickle as rainbow overtakes her look ma no wings as the racers enter equestria's whitetail wood rainbow dash is back in the lead hey rainbow why that little cheater did that on purpose it's on nice one rainbow later oh my whitetail wood is just lovely hey rainbow shouldn't you be up ahead i'm sure i'll win now except that all the other racers just passed you oh horse apples see ya applejack what are you doing up here there aren't even any trees uh no but the sign's pointed this way rainbow mind giving me a lift what a hay you said no flying no i said no wings i must say spike that this has been the most interesting running of the leaves in equestria history with the most interesting announcing but it isn't the running that's been fascinating it's the lack of running forgive me girls i know i'm not an athlete but shouldn't the running of the leaves actually involve running you know i think twilight's right you do yeah if you wanna beat me you better ruuun once again rainbow dash and applejack are neck and neck jockeying for position applejack inches ahead now it's rainbow it's applejack it's rainbow dash it's applejack oh no she di'int oh yes she di'id cut it out no you cut it out you started it and now i'm gonna finish it oh no you won't oh yes i will that's it all bets are off oh no you don't it's applejack it's rainbow dash it's applejack it's rainbow dash i won no i won i won you tied tied for first for last last then who won you oh no but i did get fifth place which is rather good considering i've never run a race before what how's that even possible you ran so slow and looked at the scenery exactly i paced myself just like my book said then at the end when all the other ponies were worn out i sprinted to the finish i don't believe it twilight beat us well with all your horsing around it was quite easy you're right twilight our behavior was just terrible we weren't very good sports sounds to me like an important lesson was learned princess celestia wh what are you doin here fall is one of my favorite seasons so i came to celebrate the running of the leaves i'm sorry you had to see us being such poor sport princess that's all right applejack anypony can get swept up in the excitement of competition it's important to remember that the friendship is always more important than the competition exactly twilight now unfortunately because the two of you were busy tricking each other instead of shaking down leaves many of the lovely trees in equestria are still covered why princess i bet we can knock those leaves down for you lickety split whaddya say friend wanna go for another run i'd love to stretch my legs boy howdy i got my work cut out for me that there's the biggest bumper crop a apples i've ever laid eyes on yep too big for you to handle on your own come on big brother you need to

apples plejack applejack oh good you're okay now applejack i completely respect the apple family ways you're always there to help anypony in need so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside and allow your friends to help you okay twilight i am not taking no for an answer what yes twilight yes please i could really use your help dear princess celestia my friend applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have and she's always there to help anypony the only trouble is when she needs help she finds it hard to accept it so while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer your faithful student twilight sparkle how about y'all take a little break i got some fine apple juice waitin for ya girls i can't thank you enough for this help i was acting a bit stubborn a bit okay a might stubborn and i'm awful sorry now i know the town gave me the prized pony award but the real award is havin you five as my friends

scootaloo i've never even heard of a pony zip lining before neither have i but spike told me it was awesome see anything tree sap and pine needles but no cutie mark plan b yeah you know where we can find a cannon at this hour it's no use no matter what we try we always end up without our cutie marks and surprisingly often covered in tree sap maybe we should do something less dangerous like pillow testing or flower sniffing this town is full of ponies who have their cutie marks why don't we ask them how they did it that's a great safe idea yeah and we can start with the coolest pony in ponyville applejack rarity come on guys i said cool you know who i'm talking about she's fast she's tough she's not afraid of anything pinkie pie no the greatest flyer ever to come out of cloudsdale fluttershy no rainbow dash oh yeah that makes much more sense of course let's do it let's find how rainbow dash earned her cutie mark yeah get back here you thievin vermins thievin what now apple

maybe see you boys at the finish line i've never seen such beautiful creatures butterflies don't fly as high as my cloud home and i've never been near the ground before what is this place filled with so many wonders casting its spell that i am now under squirrels in the trees and the cute little bunnies birds flying free and bees with their honey honeeey oh what a magical place and i owe it all to the pegasus race if i knew the ground had so much up its sleeve i'd have come here sooner and never leave yes i love everything shhh it's okay you can come out everything's okay there's nothing to be

out why i didn't have mine well done rarity your costumes are very nice nice they need to be spectacular and the performance is tomorrow i tried every trick i could think of but nothing seemed to work the costumes just weren't right and the play opened that night maybe i'm not meant to be a fashionista after all what's going on i had no idea where my horn was taking me but unicorn magic doesn't happen without a reason i knew this had to do with my love of fashion and maybe even my cutie mark i knew that this was my destiny a rock that's my destiny what is your problem horn i followed you all the way out here for a rock dumb rock ugh these namby-pamby stories aren't getting us any closer to our cutie marks they're all about finding who you really are and boring stuff like that yes

i saw the most amazing most wonderful thing i've ever seen i poured myself into learning everything i could about magic my parents decided to enroll me in princess celestia's school for gifted unicorns it was a dream come true except for one thing i had to pass an entrance exam well miss sparkle well miss sparkle we don't have all day i knew this was the most important day of my life that

i'll tell you how i got mine why not awright my sisters and i were raised on a rock farm outside of ponyville we spent our days working the fields there was no talking there was no smiling there were only rocks we were in the south field preparing to rotate rocks to the east field then all of a sudden i've never felt joy like that before it felt so good i just wanted to keep smiling forever and i wanted everyone i knew to smile too but rainbows don't come along that often i wondered how else could i create some smiles we better harvest the rocks from the south field pinkamena diane pie is that you mom i need you and dad and the sisters to come in quick surprise you like it it's called a party oh you don't like it you like it i'm so happy and that's how equestria was made wha huh look we're here maybe on the way home i can tell you the story of how i got my cutie mark it's a gem oh come on she's just being pinkie pie rainbow dash you're here i hear you're looking for my cutie mark story you have no idea what i've been through today to hear that story it all happened during the race at flight camp where i stood alone against all odds to defend fluttershy's honor i've never flown like that before that freedom was unlike anything i've ever felt the speed the adrenaline the wind in my mane i liked it a lot later rainbow crash hey turns out the only thing i liked more than flying fast was winning most people thought that the sonic rainboom was just an old mare's tale but that day the day i discovered racing i proved that the legends were true i made the impossible happen that that little ones is how you earn a cutie mark wooooow wait a second i heard that explosion and i saw the rainbow too rainbow dash if you hadn't scared the animals i never would have learned i could communicate with them and gotten my cutie mark i heard that boom and right afterwards there was amazing rainbow that taught me to smile when i got my cutie mark i saw a rainbow that pointed me home i bet it was your sonic rainboom there an explosion i could never explain when i got my cutie mark this is uncanny if that explosion didn't happen when it did i would have blown my entrance exam rainbow dash i think you helped me earn my cutie mark too we all owe our cutie marks to you do you realize what this means all of us had a special connection before we even met we've been bffs forever and we didn't even know it come here y'all gimme a break come on crusaders maybe we just need to try zip lining again hey how about a song nooooo dear princess celestia today i learned something amazing everypony everywhere has a special magical connection with her friends maybe even before she's met them if you're feeling lonely and you're still searching for your true friends just look up in the sky who knows maybe you and your future best friends are all looking at the same rainbow gross when did you get so cheesy just write it spike  let's quiet down please we have a very important lesson to get to thank you today we are going to be talking about cutie marks boring you can all see my cutie mark can't you like all ponies i wasn't born with a cutie mark my flank was blank awww the's tho prethious then one day when i was about you age i woke up to find that a cutie mark had appeared look at her hair yes i know but honestly that's how everypony was wearing their mane back then i had decided to become a teacher and the flowers symbolized my hope that i could help my future students bloom if i nurtured them with knowledge the smiles represented the cheer i hoped to bring to my little ponies while they were learning now can anyone tell me when a pony gets his or her cutie mark oh oh oh when the dithcovers that thertain thomething that maketh her thpecial that's right twist a cutie mark appears on a pony's flank when he or she finds that certain something that makes them different from every other pony discovering what makes you unique isn't something that happens overnight and no amount of hoping wishing or begging will make a cutie mark appear before it's time what apple bloom are you passing a note what could be so important that it couldn't wait until after

future was to run sweet apple acres and these bright shiny apples sealed the deal come to think of it granny smith was the last on in her class too same with big macintosh i really don't see how that's supposed to make me feel better that probably means that being the last one in your class to get a cutie mark runs in the family runs in the family runs in the family runs in the family you've

opportunity to learn a valuable lesson about friendship always expect the best from your friends and never assume the worst rest assured that a good friend always has your best interests at heart you faithful student twilight sparkle you girls wouldn't mind if we celebrated gummy's after-birthday party too would you his party was cut short and he's pretty upset about it why not let's have a party for gummy  perfect just take the broken limbs down rarity don't you all care about nothin other than prettifyin somepony has to you are making an absolute mess of the town square applejack yeah well the storm's gonna make an even bigger mess if we don't prune all these loose branches so they don't tumble down on anypony i simply cannot imagine why the pegasus ponies would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening and ruin what could have been a glorious sunny day think more practical-like will ya they accidentally skipped a scheduled sprinkle last week so we need a doozy of a downpour to make up for it is all oh no my wonderfully styled mane shall be ruined you shoulda hurried up and finished the job already it's coming down too fast help me there hunker down to your heart's content whilst i finish this oo no no nooo what now i'd prefer not to get my hooves muddy gah there is just no pleasin ya is there everything's gotta be just so well and how does muddying my hooves serve any useful purpose you wouldn't know useful if it came up and bit you that doesn't even make any sense does so does not does so does not does so does not does so infinity hah does not infinity plus one heh what's say we go our separate ways before one of us says something she will regret i reckon y'all are gonna say something you'll regret first on the contrary i believe it shall almost certainly be you who says something you will regret first i'm not sayin anythin nor am i you'll just be on your way then after you perhaps we should stick together for now and find some shelter uh-huh perhaps we should and fast nice and dry under here sorta ooh unacceptable applejack rarity applejack rarity twilight come inside girls quick whoa nelly is inside a tree really the best place to be in a lightin storm it is if you have a magical lighting rod protecting your home like i do come on in we are most grateful for your invitation thank ya kindly for your hospitality uh do be a polite houseguest and go wash up please won't you if i gotta spend one more second with that fussbudget rarity today i can't be held responsible for what i'm gonna do some storm huh the pegasus ponies sure have outdone themselves this time i hope you and applejack don't have any trouble getting home it may indeed be a problem well you're welcome to stay if need be spike is away in canterlot on royal business i'm home all alone tonight you and applejack should totally sleep over we'll have a slumber party i've always wanted one of those oh oh goodness uh i do believe i have another engagement scheduled for this evening that completely slipped my mind until just now hahahah oh silly me i can't possibly stay here all night with applejack all you've ever wanted to know my own personal copy it's a fantastic reference guide you should see the table of contents i've been waiting for a chance to use it and today is the day this is gonna be so great yes uh great what in tarnation now wait just a goll-darn minute you made me wash the mud off my hooves but it's okay for y'all to have mud all over your faces silly this is called a mud mask it's to refresh and rejuvenate your complexion we're giving each other makeovers we have to do it it says so in the book everything you oh hay would you look at the time i gotta skedaddle on home quick i'm powerful late for uh somethin uh g'night or maybe i'll sit here for a spell hurray slumber party what in the world is this for to reduce the puffiness around one's eyes of course puffiness-shmuffiness that's good eatin isn't this exciting we'll do everything by the book and that will make my slumber party officially fun did you hear that applejack you certainly would not want to do anything that would ruin twilight's very first slumber party would you of course not n you wouldn't either i reckon so do we have an agreement you betcha oh gross you know there's messy and there's just plain rude you know there's fussy and there's just plain gettin on my nerves fortunately i can get along with anypony no matter how difficult she may be oh yeah well i'm the get-alonginest pony you're ever gonna meet that's not even a word this is gonna be the bestest slumber party ever yay yay sooo how are you getting along over there applejack just fine rarity this is so awesome check ooh it says here we have to tell ghost stories who wants to go first me i'd like to tell y'all a terrifying tale of the prissy ghost who drove everypony crazy with unnecessary neatness i'm sure y'all are familiar with that one never heard of it but i have a much better one it's the horrifying story of the messy inconsiderate ghost who irritated everypony within the hundred miles that's not a real story you made it up it is a ghost story they're all made up i've got one this story's called the legend of the headless horse it was a dark and stormy night just like this one and three ponies were having a slumber party just like this one and just when the last pony thought she was safe there standing right behind her just inches away was the headless horse check now who wants s'mores then you place one marshmallow on the top of the chocolate and be sure it's centered that's critical and then carefully put another perfectly square graham cracker on the top aaand done ta-da nah you just eat em you could at least say excuse me oh i was just about to but you interrupted me pardon check now the next item of fun we have to do is truth of dare i dare applejack to do something carefully and neatly for a change oh yeah well i dare rarity to lighten up and stop obsessin over every last little detail for a change i think the truth of the matter is that somepony could stand to pay a little more attention to detail and i think the truth is somepony ought to quit with their fussin so the rest of us can get things done um i don't think this is how the game is supposed to work you have to give an honest answer to any question or do whatever anypony dares you to do i dare you to step outside and let your precious tidy mane get ruined again you have to it's the rule ha fine okay i dare applejack to play dress up in a frou-frou glittery lacey outfit happy very um do i ever get a turn i dare you to enter the next rodeo when it comes to town i dare you not to enter the next rodeo that comes to town i dare ya to not comb your mane a hundred times for a bit and i dare you to comb yours just once i uh i think we should check off truth of dare and move on let's see what our next fun-fun-fun thing is shall we hm what does this mean pillow fight oh please i am not at all interested in participating in something so crude it is on oh i get it pillow-fight fun uh girls maybe we should take it down a notch i will if she will she started it maybe we should just call it a night and get some sleep keep your muddy hooves on your side of the bed my hooves ain't muddy they were there might still be a little on them there ain't see now who's bein inconciderate i have to make the bed again so the blanket will be right get up hey uh-uh-uh you'll ruin it you have to do it like this yeah that's not gonna happen geronimo hey you did that on purpose um yeah get up so i can fix it again can't hear ya i'm asleep i ain't budgin you will if you want any blanket give it back i will not yes you will won't will won't will won't will enough it says right here that the number one thing you're supposed to do at a slumber party is have fun and thanks to you two i can't check that off i've been tryin my darnest to get along no it is i who have been trying my best no it was me no it was i me i i hope you're happy both of you you've ruined my very first slumber party the makeover the s'mores truth of dare the pillow fight i mean is there anything else that could possible go wrong sorry i asked you see that's why we needed to take down all those loose branches in town not spiffy em up but i out of my way missy time's a-wastin wait stop don't no waitin no stopin doin and that my friends is what we call gettin er done i tried to tell you it would come crashing down in here well you shoulda tried harder i'm mighty sorry twilight it's well it no okay it's a giant tree branch in the middle of my bedroom and the book doesn't say anything about having a giant tree branch in your slumber party or at least i haven't found that entry yet what in tarnation are y'all doin over there cleaning up this mess somepony made who was that again oh right that's you we gotta do somethin baking bffs brothers there's nothing in here about branches rarity for pony's sake stop sweatin small stuff and help me get rid of this thing i said hussle over here and help me look i'm sorry alright what was that i said i'm sorry i shoulda listen to you when you noticed where this here branch would end up you annoin attention to detail woulda save us from this whole mess but right now you need to stop being so dang fussy pickin up all those little things and help me move the one big thing in here that actually matters please but i'll get all icky consarnit what a you i mean yes ickiness is often a side effect of hard work but y'all need to get over it on account of i just can't fix this mess i made myself i need your help let's do this well they do have a section about backyard slumber parties is that what we're doing right now does this count as camping i look awful better thanks oh pretty where did these come from they're not in the book either is it bigger than a barn nope is it smaller than a saddle no only three of your twenty questions left oh we're never gonna guess what you're thinkin of it could be anythin are we getting warmer why is it too cold in here for you i can turn up the heat she means are we gettin any closer with our guesses oh no and that technically counted as a question so only two more left is it a sixed-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted mane and shootin stars comin out of his eyes who flies through the air all over the world to hide magic sparkly eggs that's it it is no it that but it was just so nice to see you two finally getting along i wanted you to be able to win together see we could have been having fun like this all along if only somepony hadn't been so persnickety well maybe she wouldn't have been if somepony else hadn't been so sloppy sorry for bein just a pain in the patootie oh no i'm sure i was much worse that's kind of you to say but i'm the one who's sorry oh i'm much more sorry than you are are not are too are not are too are not are too i declare my first slumber party a success check now take two steps your left uh no my left whi which is it that mess is your fault not mine sorry dear princess celestia it's hard to believe that two ponies who seem to have so little in common could ever get along but i found out that if you embrace each others differences you just might be surpriced to discover a way to be friends after all so who's up for another slumber party

them wrapped around my hoof the entire time i can't wait to write to princess celestia to tell her what you taught me today me what did i teach you just because somepony is ladylike doesn't make her weak in fact by using her wits a seemingly defenseless pony can be the one who outsmarts and outshines them all outshines is right now you have enough gems to cover sapphire shores's costumes not if you eat them all spike wow what a gorgeous day rainbow dash must've gotten up early for once and cleared all the clouds away i bet all of ponyville is gonna be out enjoying the sunshine what where is

kindness it's an easy feat and magic makes it all complete yeah did you see her twilight did you see zecora and then a bunch of you flip out for no good reason no good reason you call protectin yer kin no good reason why as soon as my sister saw zecora ridin into town she started shakin in her little horseshoes so i swept her up and brought er here i walked here myself for safekeepin not from that creepy zecora she's mysterious sinister will you cut that out just look at those stripes so garish she's a zebra a what a zebra and her stripes aren't a fashion choice rarity they're what she was born with born where i've never seen a pony well she's probably not from here and she's not a pony my book says zebras come from a faraway land but i've never seen her in ponyville where does she live that's just it she lives in the everfree forest spike the everfree forest just ain't natural the plants grow animals care for themselves and the clouds move all on their own and that wicked enchantress zecora lives there doing her evil uh stuff she's so evil i even wrote a song about her she does evil dances and if you look deep in her eyes she'll put you in trances then what will she do she'll mix up an evil brew and she'll gobble you up in a big tasty stew wow catchy it's a work in progress this is all just a bunch of gossip and rumors now tell me what exactly have you seen zecora do well once a month she comes into ponyville then she lurks by the stores and then she digs at the ground maybe she comes to town to visit yeah maybe she's just tryin t'be neighborly and maybe she's not lurking by the stores maybe she's going to them lurk-free to do some shopping yeah everypony likes to shop you know what i think applebloom hush and let the big ponies talk what about digging at the ground you gotta admit that's weird what if she's digging for innocent creatures i'm sure there's an explanation for everything zecora does and if anypony here were actually brave enough to approach her she would find out the truth well i'm brave enough i'm gonna find out myself download gom player to experience the highest video and audio quality you ponies are being ridiculous yeah but i heard it's the evil way she eats hay the door's open she went outside and zecora's still out there spike you stay here in case applebloom comes back will do applebloom you get back here right now folk those leaves of blue are not a joke you keep yer creepy mumbo-jumbo to yerself ya hear yeah back atcha zecora you and your lame curse are the ones who better beware and you why couldn't you just listen to your big sister who knows what kinda nasty curse zecora coulda just put on you just like in my song you guys there's no such thing as curses well that's interesting to hear coming from miss magic-pants herself my magic real magic comes from within it's a skill you're born with curses are artificial fake magic it's conjured with potions and incantations all smoke and mirrors meant to scare but curses have no real power they're just an old pony tale just you wait twilight you're gonna learn that some pony tales really are true does evil dances beware beware she will put you in trances yeah was that supposed to scare us wicked a curse just you wait twilight some pony tales really are true a big tasty stew curses-shmurses no no no no no none of these books have a cure an illness an allergy a curse i said a real reason something that points to something real how about this one spike the word supernatural refers to things like ghosts and spirits and zombies which are as make-believe as curses this book is just a bunch of hooey but what if you're wrong twilight what if this really is a a purse how could it be a purse pinkie what happened spthe thputh a curth on me

things ya asked for what in ponyville is goin on here you're okay why wouldn't i be because zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us and was going to cook you up into soup oh twilight did those silly fillies finally get in yer head y'know there's no such thing as a curse there and tell me this isn't a curse it was a warning about that blue plant it's called poison joke that plant is much like poison oak but its results are like a joke what in the hay does that mean it means this plant does not breed wrath instead this plant just wants a laugh will somepony please talk normal i think what she's saying is that when we ran in to save applebloom we ran into the poison joke all our problems were just little jokes it played on us little jokes ok fine but what about the cauldron and the chanting and the creepy decor treasures of the native land where i am from this one speaks hello and this welcome not welcoming at all if you ask me the words i chanted were from olden times something you call a nursery rhyme but the cauldron the applebloom soup lookie here twilight that pot o'water wasn't for me it was for all these herbal ingredients the cure for poison joke is a simple old natural remedy you just gotta take a bubble bath books and couldn't find anything what book has this natural remedy here is the book you see sad that you lack it in your library didn't look inside because the title was so weird i had the answer the whole time if only i had bothered to look inside chuckle maybe next time you will take a second look and not judge the cover of the book zecora would you be kind enough to mix up another batch of the herbal bath mix it up i certainly will yet i am missing an herb from ponyville but whenever zecora comes to town all the shops are mysteriously closed look rose how awful the wicked enchantress has cursed them all the horror the horror daisy we need to talk never judge a book by its cover someone may look unusual or funny or scary but you have to look past that and learn who they are inside real friends don't care what your cover is it's the contents of a pony that count and a good friend like a good book is something that will last forever your faithful student twilight sparkle miss zecora i would love to get the recipe for this bath it's simply luxurious i'm right here li'l sis i ain't tiny no more ooh i have never felt so lovely in all my life oh my gosh i've never realized how horrible it is to not be able to talk i mean i love talking so much and when i couldn't talk cause my tongue was all ehhhh it was the worst

something anything i can help you with well how would you like to help create ponyville's finest birds nests birds nests why yes when the weather team guides the birds back north for the spring they'll need a place to live and lay their eggs wow rarity that one's really beautiful oh why thank you most sincerely would you like to try your hoof at a nest would i yes where do i begin okay now uh take some of that straw and hay over there and a little bit of branch now weave them through there yes uh take some ribbon yes oh uh n not there oohhh yes tuck it in over there uh but be careful not to oh no no i i guess that will do oh dear there it looks just like yours oh my that nest needs to be condemned oh spike it's not so bad maybe the birds can use it as a an outhouse spike it's just fine it's just a little rough aroung the edges let me lend you a hoof let's just untie this ribbon and if we take out these sticks here we'll shape this i think we lost her and we need to weave the string in here hellooo twilight wow pinkie pie you're quite a skater probably the best skater i've ever seen thanks twilight i've been doing this since i was an itty-bitty little-wittle twinkie-pinkie this comes naturally which is probably why they designated me the lake scorer i cut lines in the lake with my skates that way when the rest of the weather team comes here to break the ice it will be easy as pie how clever when the thick ice begins to melt it will break along the lines well you sure have a lot of work ahead of you there's quite a few lakes in ponyville huh tell me about it hey twilight wanna help me out would i come on put on those skates over there i bet you'll be a natural too okay maybe on second thought what are you talking about you said you wanted to be helpful now get out there twilight steer steer oh boy you are a natural twilight natural disaster twilight you did a great job your first time around i'm sure my first time was just as wobbly and bobbly and crasherrific as yours really no but did i make you feel better yeah i guess i bet you'll be super awesome at something that keeps your hooves on the ground i know fluttershy could probably use your help with the critters well i'm pretty good with little animals yeah i'll go help her it's that way wake up little sleepy heads hope you had some wonderful dreams and restful hibernation but it's time to up now spring is coming awww how cute aren't they this is my favorite task the whole season when i get to see all my little animal friends again uh what's hibernation it's like a long sleep long sleep yes wake up little porcupines animals often hibernate through the winter to save their energy and eat less food i definitely like the idea of hibernation uh except for the eat less food part oh but just look at all these warrens and dens i'm worried that i won't be able to wake up every animal before spring comes well i'll help fluttershy oh you will oh that would be wonderful okay let's start there hello wake up little friends wherever you are spring is coming i wonder which cute little furry creatures i've awoken aaa snakes snaaakes good morning friends all this winter wrap up stuff is a lot harder than it looks right because there's no magic why don't you just use magic twilight and get it done the right way no spike i have to do it the traditional way ponyville has never needed magic to wrap up winter but they never had you here before either think of how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic no no no i'm gonna find some other way that i can help out if it kills me keep pushin caramel that's it bumpkin i know it's hard work but you guys are doin great yeehaw hey applejack how's everything going oh just dandy little slow startin but peachy all the same

just give me a chance well i never turn down a hard worker but think of how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic i could use a come-to-life spell here goes she's awful strong for such a little pony that's my girl following my advice and what in tarnation does that mean slow down slow down what's goin on what'd you do you used magic didn't you nuts twilight you used magic the nerve can you believe her that's not how we do it round here twilight and especially not on my farm well see i just wanted to oh come on twilight come on out i'm a winter mess up oh you're good at a lot of things just not nest making ice skating animal waking snow clearing huh thanks a lot for making me feel sooo much better that's what i'm here for sister rainbow dash y'all on the weather team

gotta melt that snow now no you simply must wait okay go stop go stop go stop urgh make up your minds oh what in equestria are all you arguing about this sort of sillyness is why we were late for spring last year and the year before that and the year before that did she say late i was hoping my amazingly inspirational speech would urge everyone to do better than last year but now it looks like we're going to be later than ever i mean just look at this catastrophe the ice scorers made the ice chunks too big to melt the nest designer's horrendously behind we need several hundred and she's only made one and don't get me started on all the clouds still in the sky the icicles on the trees oh this isn't good not at all and it's gonna be all to pieces disastrous if we can't get our seeds all planted chillax applejack we're busting our chops as fast as we can no not fast you have to wake animals slowly uh aj oh good gravy caramel lost the grass seeds again didn't he ey-yup ditzy-doo accidentally went north to get the southern birds oh that featherbrain didn't she learn her lesson last year when she went west stop this at once we don't have time to argue it's almost sundown spring is going to be late again another year of scandal and shame if only we could be more organized spike get my checklist and clipboard stat eh yes m'am stop everypony stop sorry i know you all want to complete your jobs on time but arguing is no way to go about it what you need is organization and i'm just the pony for the job i can't believe it spring is here on time and we have you to thank for it if it weren't for your organizing skills we would still be arguing ey-yup it was a team effort and since you helped every team we have an official vest for you we give you the title all-team organizer gosh i don't even know what to say thank you everypony and hereby i declare that winter is wrapped up on time spike sure gonna be in for a hog-sized surprise when that last piece a ice melts dear princess celestia winter wrap up was one of the most special things i've ever been a part of here in ponyville it helped me to learn that we all have hidden talents and if we're patient and diligent we're sure to find them and as always with good friendship and teamwork ponies can accomplish anything how's that spike spike oh spike once upon a time in a magical land of equestria there were two regal sisters who ruled together and created harmony for all the land to do this the eldest used her unicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn the younger brought out the moon to begin the night thus the two sisters maintained balance all the different types of ponies but as time went on the younger sister became resentful the ponies relished and played in the day her elder sister brought forth but shunned and slept through her beautiful night one fateful day the younger unicorn refused to lower the moon to make way for the dawn the elder sister tried to reason with her but the bitterness in the young one's heart had transformed her into a nightmare moon she vowed that she would shroud the land in eternal night reluctantly the elder sister harnessed the elements of harmony using the magic of the elements of harmony she defeated her younger sister and banished her permanently in the moon the elder sister took on responsibility for both sun and moon and harmony has been maintained in equestria for generations since hm elements of harmony i know i've heard of those before but where my little pony my little pony aaaaah my little pony i used to wonder what friendship could be my little pony until you all shared its magic with me big adventure tons of fun a beautiful heart faithful and strong sharing kindness it's an easy feat and magic makes it all complete you

find me that old copy of predictions and prophesies what's that for well it was a gift for moondancer but oh spike you know we don't have time for that sort of thing but we're on a break no no no no

pony who wanted to rule equestria defeated by the elements of harmony and imprisoned in the moon legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year the stars will aid in her escape and she will bring about nighttime eternal spike do you know what this means no take a note please to the princess okie dokie my dearest teacher my continuing studies of pony magic have led me to discover that we're on the precipice of disaster hold on preci preci threshold threee uh brink that something really bad is about to happen for you see the mythical mare in the moon is in fact nightmare moon

afraid i have to say no see i'd never leave my friends hanging wow come on twilight isn't this what you've been waitin for the elements of harmony we've found them careful careful one two three four there's only five where's the sixth when the five are present a spark will cause the sixth element to be revealed what in the hay is that supposed to mean i'm not sure but i have an idea stand back i don't know what will happen come on now y'all she needs to concentrate twilight the elements twilight where are you look come on you're kidding you're kidding right just one spark come on come on no no but where's the sixth element you little foal thinking you could defeat me now you will never see your princess or your sun the night will last forever you think you can destroy the elements of harmony just like that well you're wrong because the spirits of the elements of harmony are right here what applejack who reassured me when i was in doubt represents the spirit of honesty fluttershy who tamed the manticore with her compassion represents the spirit of kindness pinkie pie who banished fear by giggling in the face of danger represents the spirit of laughter rarity who calmed a sorrowful serpent with a meaningful gift represents the spirit of generosity and rainbow dash who could not abandon her friends for her own heart's desire represents the spirit of loyalty the spirits of these five ponies got us through every challenge you threw at us you still don't have the sixth element the spark didn't work but it did a different kind of spark i felt it the very moment i realized how happy i was to hear you to see you how much i cared about you the spark ignited inside me when i realized that you all are my friends you see nightmare moon when those elements are ignited by the the spark that resides in the heart of us all the element of magic noooooo my head everypony okay oh thank goodness why rarity it's so lovely i know i'll never part with it again no your necklace it looks just like your cutie mark so does yours look at mine look at mine oooh yeah gee twilight i though you were just speaking a lot of hooey but i reckon we really do represent the elements of friendship indeed you do princess celestia twilight sparkle my faithful student i knew you could do it but you told me it was all an old pony tale i told you that you needed to make some friends nothing more i saw the signs of nightmare moon's return and i knew it was you who had the magic inside to defeat her but you could not unleash it until you let true friendship into your heart
