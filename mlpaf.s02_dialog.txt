Looks a mite dangerous, Score.
That's where
the Little Ponies are, Tex.
That's where Buttons is!
Then that's
where we're gonna go.
Now, you lil' 'uns head back
up to the hills and stay safe.
Come on!
Let's see some teamwork.
Whoa!
Now that's what I call teamwork.
Boy howdy!
I'm beginnin' to understand
why all the Little Ponies
left home.
Maybe.
But there's something
weird about all this.
Truly!
Hey, c'mere,
we wanna talk to ya.
Well how do you like that?
Lickety-Split?
It's us.
It's the Big Brother Ponies.
Not now, I've gotta
get some more ice cream.
Heart Throb!
No!
I am Salome,
one of the most famous lovers
in history.
Heart Throb,
don't you recognize us?
Go away,
you're spoiling my performance.
No!
You're gonna listen to us.
Heart Throb...you're so old.
I feel fine.
Now get out of here!
I want to be alone.
Gingerbread!
I just gotta find Buttons
I gotta know if she's okay.
That gal's face looked like
40 miles of bad road.
Something is not
altogether ship-shape here.
I'll say!
We've got to get them
outta here now.
And we can't let
anything stop us.
Wooaaaah!
Well shift my gears!
Boy, what a spread!
Ho-ho-ho!
Blow me down!
Now who coulda' known
that football is my game?
Aye, and there's the
fine ship I've always wanted.
Wait a minute, guys.
This isn't right.
It's too perfect.
Yeah, ain't it just?
So, they won't play, eh?
No!
No, don't make me do it
Somnambula.
What you're doing is evil.
I have my youth back
I have my new powers.
You don't think I'm going
to stop now, do you?
Now, sing!
No!
Don't listen to it!
All aboard?
Yee Haw! It's roundup time!
Let's burn rubber.
All power back -
Full speed ahead!
Batter up!
It's a wide-end run.
He's on the 50, the 40, the 30!
I've got to get out
of here.
I've just got to.
Gotta get out.
Gotta get out.
Oh, I am out.
Hey, look!
Hey!
Over here.
There she is! Look!
Yeah, I see her!
What do you want?
Have you seen the ponies?
They're in there,
and they're all playing.
What?
Somnambula made me
sing them into a trance.
Who's Somnambula?
She's an awful witch,
who takes the youth for herself
and only gives back age.
Y-you put them in a trance?
Can you put them out of it?
Well, I suppose I could sing a
different song,
but I'm not going back there.
I'm not going anywhere
near Somnambula again.
But you have to help us.
Please!
Help rescue our friends.
Yeah, help us! Please!
Okay...I'll help.
Will you come with me?
YES!
Okay, no one's around.
Cover your ears.
The Ponies!
Got to help them!
What am I doin'?
You came!
You rescued us.
Our heroes.
But what's happened to us?
We're so old.
Where's Buttons?
I can't find her.
Yeah! I haven't
seen any of the unicorns.
And you won't, either.
4-Speed, Slugger,
come with me.
The rest of you -
protect the Little Ponies.
And bring that bird.
You heard him.
Let's get down to business.
Yee-Haw!
Let's break it down.
Aaaagh!
Let's try again.
Now you'll know what it's like
to have someone gnawin' on you.
Hey, watch where you're goin'!
This is gettin' us nowhere.
We've got to get it open.
Remember Slugger -
Buttons is probably
on the other side.
It's like
all their magic powers
are being sucked
into that crystal.
So...that's it.
Somnambula's been getting
her youth from the other ponies,
and her new powers
from the unicorns.
Quite right, Kyrie!
And I've no intention
of giving them up.
Woo-Wee!
Sing, Kyrie
wake the unicorns up.
But she can't.
Then, I'll stop you myself.
Ah...but you won't.
Buttons!
No!
NO!
No...!
No, no!
Well, tie me up
and brand me.
Ya all's young again!
And everybody's safe
and sound.
What about Slugger?
And Buttons?
Don't worry.
They're the safest
and soundest of any of us.
Let's hard a port and
set sail for safe dry dock.
I've got a better idea, Salty.
Let's go home instead?
There it is!
Then that's where we're going.
Ice! Look out!
Don't go near it!
Cowards!
More of you?
No matter,
I'll deal with you too.
Wrong! We'll deal with you!
Everybody out of here, now!
Bushwoolies! We are leaving.
You bet! Leaving!
Outta here.
Wait for me.
Gone, Yeah!
No matter where you run,
I can find you.
I will find you.
It doesn't look good,
does it Wind Whistler?
No, the desertification is
proceeding at an alarming pace.
At this rate, it will consume
Paradise Estate
in a matter of hours.
Well, we've gotten away
from Lavan and his demons,
now what do we do?
The Moochick said we have to
find the Heart of Ponyland.
The Heart of Ponyland?
I seem to recall
an ancient legend about that.
I remember too.
A magical talisman
far beneath Lavan's kingdom.
What does it do?
According to the legend,
it's the source from which our
magic wands draw their power.
Maybe if we can bring
the wands to it,
we can recharge
them with magic!
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's get moving.
What is it?
Master, we can find no trace
of the Princess Ponies
and their friends.
Incompetent fool!
Ah!
If you want anything done right,
you have to do it yourself.
How are you Princesses
holding up?
Oh, well enough.
Considering...
Considering what?
Considering how ugly
these caverns are.
And that there are no
plants or trees or flowers.
And that...hm, sorry.
I didn't mean to complain.
There it is!
The Heart of Ponyland.
Now I remember.
According to the legend,
we have to lay
our wands in the crowns
and then their power
will be restored.
Well, no time like the present.
Oh, no!
It's Lavan!
Get away from there.
Oh, with every new minute,
I learn how to control
my powers more.
You have no chance!
Oh! What's going to happen?
Lavan controls
the high ground.
He can stay where he is
and pick us off,
or he can come down and get us.
What else can he do?
He could give up.
Ah!
But I don't think
we should count on that.
I'm gonna make
one last surveillance flight
before we return to the others.
Be careful, Wind Whistler.
Wind Whistler!
Oh!
I-I can't move it.
Go get the others.
But there's not enough time!
By the time
I get back with help...
Ooh, we're done for now.
Lavan's going to destroy us all.
Unless we fight back!
How?
He's too powerful.
Here's my plan.
I'll distract him
while you and then we...
Ponies! Surrender!
And I might let you live!
Never!
If that's how you want it...
Charge! Bushwoolies!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Oh boy, Charge!
Yeah, Bushwoolies
like to charge.
Yeah, yeah, charge, charge!
Let's go! Yeah.
Uh-oh...
Drop those wands!
Nah! I just made it!
Get to the Heart.
I'll take care of Lavan.
Yay!
Yeah, yay!
Uh-oh!
Stop!
Quickly!
We must work together.
No!
No!
He's gone.
Yeah, and we will be too unless
we fix Ponyland's magic.
Let's put our wands
together again.
Uhh! Uhh!
Wind Whistler, look!
What does it mean,
Wind Whistler?
It means everything
is all right now, Locket.
Oh, my, my, my!
Oh, this is powerful magic.
The most powerful
there is, Habbit.
Oh, well, Magic
can't fix everything.
Everything's back to normal.
I can sense it.
We could not have defeated Lavan
without your help, Bushwoolies.
Aww, shucks... It's nothing...
In return for your bravery,
we knight you.
Henceforth, you shall
guard these crowns
as we guard the magic wands.
Wow! Yay!
Bushwoolies like it.
Watch 'em close!
Yeah!
I will keep this last one,
in memory of the Bushwoolie who
was lost in the Jewel Desert.
Uh, does anyone have any idea
how we get out of here?
That's easy, Spike.
Goodbye, my friends.
Come back and visit
the new kingdom
of the Lava Demons
and the Ice Orgs.
Well, the magic has been put
right in Ponyland again
and Lavan is no more.
Our quest is over.
We never did decide
who should be queen.
I know!
Let's all take turns.
Good idea!
Perfect!
A terrific idea.
It's too bad
about that poor Bushwoolie.
It's also too bad that
I lost the Rainbow of Light.
We'll never find
it in the desert.
Hey, everybody, look!
Oh!
Here, Megan, Rainbow of Light.
Bushwoolie bushed!
What for dinner?
Did you do that?
That was marvelous.
Yes, well, I am a Gnome.
And Gnomes have powers
over earth and stone.
But we're back to
where we started now.
But the castle's
made out of stone.
Can't you use your powers
on it to get us in there?
Not really.
The castle is
magically protected.
I can't do anything with the
stone in it unless I'm inside.
We could catch the castle
without any trouble,
if it weren't for those
creatures guarding it.
The Undine and the Salamander
uh... a water creature
and a fire creature.
Yeah, them.
If we could just find a
way to dry up the Undine.
Yeah!
Or put out the
Salamander's flame.
We can.
It's simple.
I think she's heard
too many fairytales.
No, no.
It's a perfect plan.
We'll just use them
against each other.
It just might work!
Let's give it a go!
Hey, you!
Undine!
Your mother wears galoshes.
Yoo-hoo! Salamander.
Your fire's not that hot.
And neither are you.
Na, na, brrr!
Yeah!
Okay! Let's go before
the castle can pull away
from these mountains again.
Inside! Quickly!
Oh, this is so exciting!
Boy, it sure is
spooky and confusing.
We could get lost in
here real easy.
We need a guide.
I think I might be
able to provide that.
Show us the way to Ariel.
That's great.
How'd you do that?
It was nothing.
Let's not waste any more time.
I want to find
Ariel, my true love.
Be careful, ponies.
Just because we're inside
doesn't mean it's safe.
We won't have any problem.
Just watch.
Everything's going to
fall right into place.
Whoa!
Are you going to believe
me when I say "be careful"?
I certainly will.
We're almost there.
I can feel it.
Oh, my!
Oh! This is so wonderful!
Ariel, my beloved.
At last, we'll be together.
Look out!
We've got to stop them
so that Garth can awaken Ariel
with a kiss.
Oh, really?
I thought we had to stop them
because they'll make
baked Alaska
out of us if we don't.
My wings are soaked.
I can't fly.
Help!
Thanks, Heart Throb.
Thanks, Locket.
Help! Do something!
Get us out of here!
Ah!
No! Nothing can happen
to my true love.
No!
Thanks, Garth.
What can we do?
The castle!
Make the castle shake, Garth.
Now is our chance.
Jump on, Garth!
Look!
Thank you.
Look there!
Oh, my goodness!
Ferdinand! Andrew!
My dear boys, what
are you doing here?
My lady.
My lady.
Who are they?
And what are they doing here?
My name is Ferdinand
and this is Andrew.
We were the suitors
for the hand of Ariel
that made her father
cast the spell.
These boys caused
so much trouble,
my father made them my
protectors all these years.
You're not going to take
one of them
for your husband now, are you?
Oh, no, no, no.
They're nice boys, but
they're not for me.
Oh, thank goodness!
Well, thank you all very much
for coming and waking me.
And now I must be going.
Wait! I woke you from the spell.
You're supposed to be mine now.
Look! I don't mean
to be rude or anything,
but the spell wasn't my idea.
I'm not ready to
fall in love yet.
But...but it's not fair.
What's happening?
The spell's over,
now that Ariel's awake.
The castle's starting to fall.
You didn't land the castle
before you woke me?
Give me a break.
I was busy.
We'd better get out of here!
But there's not enough
of us to carry everybody.
Garth, do something.
Why should I bother?
I don't care anymore.
Garth, how could you?
Please!
You've got to help us!
Please! Not for my
sake, but for theirs.
Any moment the whole
castle will crush.
That's it!
Come on!
Oh! hey!
Make the sand soft, Garth,
like you did before.
Oh, all right.
Look at what he's doing!
Please come back inside.
You could fall...
It worked!
It worked!
Now let's get back to Ariel.
Get away from it, quickly!
That was close!
Are you all right, my beloved?
Fine, thanks.
A little dusty.
Well, I guess you'll be on your
way now to begin your new life.
Just a moment!
Garth's right.
It's not fair.
Yeah. Are you sure you
won't change your mind?
Well, there's always
that possibility.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Goodbye! - Farewell!
Gee Sweet Stuff,
I saw Mimic going this way.
She should be...
There she is!
Mimic! Mimic!
Where'd she go?
Mimic, What's the matter?
I...I don't know...
Sweet Stuff,
what are we going to do?
Mimic's so weak, it's scary!
When North Star brings Megan,
she'll help Mimic get well.
There they are.
Sweet Stuff, Surprise,
How's Mimic?
Let's hurry inside.
Aww, is that
more comfortable Mimic?
Thank you, Cupcake.
Hello, Mimic
how are you feeling?
The twinkle is gone
from her eys.
She's lost her appetite.
She hasn't eaten
anything in three days.
No cough, no fever,
her tongue isn't coated,
and her throat isn't red,
she's awfully pale.
But I don't know what's wrong?
Neither do we.
It's not like any illness
we've ever had.
Could...could it be magic?
Magic, that's it!
When magic's involved,
the Moochick is the one to see.
I'll take you to him, Megan.
Let's go.
Just a minute, Megan,
I'm coming with you.
Me too.
We'll all go with you, Megan.
I'm coming too.
Hop on Spike.
We'll be back soon Mimic.
Hold on!
Hurry back!
And good luck.
There, all safe and sound.
Gee Thanks.
Wolves!
Run for the Moochick's cottage.
I've done it, Habbit.
Help! Open up!
Whoever you are,
go away, go away.
I'm busy.
Nduh! No.
I'm sorry.
But this is an emergency.
Wolves were after us.
Oh! Ha, ha, hah.
No, no, no, no, no!
That was my wolf box.
Oh! But it was supposed
to scare you away, oh!
Ummm...Mr. Moochick,
Mimic is sick
and we think it's due to magic.
Uh-ah, what?
She's lost her twinkle.
Can ya help her?
Hmmm...
Well, I'm sure I have something
about sick unicorns
in a book somewhere.
Aha! Yes this book
is the very one.
"Pony Legends and History."
"The Legend of
the Four Golden Horseshoes."
Yes, of course!
Ah! Mimic is descended
from this unicorn.
"Long ago, in the land of
Argyte,
four horseshoes were made
of mystical starlight."
Yes, oh.
"They were placed on the
hooves of this special unicorn.
Now, each shoe gave her
a magical power."
My, my, my!
"The first showed the future,
"the second had
the power of blazing light,
"the third made
another's thoughts
"sound clear and loud,
and the fourth let its wearer
float like a cloud."
"Deep in dream valley,
the wind left her at dawn
And there she did stay,
for her horseshoes were gone."
That's all fascinating,
Mr. Moochick.
But what does it have to do
with Mimic's illness?
Well, my, my.
Mimic is a direct descendent
of that unicorn.
And the magic of the shoes
still flows in her veins.
Over the years,
the Golden Horseshoes
have been carried
farther and farther apart.
And because of that,
their magic is weakening.
That's why Mimic
is getting weaker.
Where do we find the Horseshoes?
In the Land of Screera.
It's said that the Scree gaze
upon one to see what will be.
Okay, we're going to Screera.
Now, while you hunt for
the Horseshoes,
Habbit and I will
look after poor Mimic.
Won't we Habbit?
Here child.
This might prove
of better use to you than me.
Oh now! Dear, dear, dear...
Well, let's see.
I was about to turn
yellow into blue, uh, I think.
Oh! Of course, poor Mimic!
Come along, Habbit!
What are you wasting time for?
It's over there! That's Screera.
If this is Screera, North Star,
where are the Scree?
They're all around us.
I'd bet five-to-one
you'd come back, North Star.
I want you all
to meet Fleetfoot,
leader of the Scree.
And watcher
of the Crescent of Visions.
That was how I could
predict North Star's return.
Isn't that cheating?
Screes only bet on sure things.
But the Crescent of Visions did
not show why you returned.
It's like this...
You see, Mimic,
one of the ponies...
The Crescent fell from the sky,
it was a gift to the Scree.
We cannot part with it.
That's the horseshoe,
but what can we do?
Shhh...I have an idea.
Fleetfoot, I challenge
you to a race.
The winner gets the Crescent.
On one condition!
If you lose, you become
my servant forever!
Done.
Oh, poor Wind Whistler,
she looks so embarrassed.
Come on! Wind Whistler!
You can do it!
Oh, no!
Oh! Wind Whistler.
The Crescent never lies.
It foretold
that Fleetfoot would win.
Of course, we Scree,
only bet on sure things.
Silly ponies!
So that's what's going on.
But they won't get
away with it.
Wolves scream...
My head's goin' in!
Megan,
what are you doing?
They cheated.
They knew Fleetfoot would win.
And we need it for Mimic's sake.
I say...
These ninnies don't play fair.
It's worth a try.
Horseshoe of Visions,
where is the Horseshoe of Light?
That's Blarkland!
I've been there.
Great! Show us the way.
So you want the Horseshoe
to save your friend, correct?
We Blarks collect, keep,
and trade junk and riddles.
You have no junk.
So, tell me a riddle
I don't know,
and the Horseshoe is yours.
Thank you.
That's very generous.
Uh...why did the boy threw
the alarm clock out the window?
Because he wanted
to see time fly.
Tell me one I don't know!
I have a riddle.
What walks on four legs
in the morning,
two at mid day,
and three at sunset?
Uh...a three-toed bullfrog?
No...uh,
a dragon with gooseflesh?
Um-uh, a gyrating galumpadillo?
I guess not...
I give up!
What?!
Humans, like Megan.
They crawl as babies,
they walk as adults,
and they use a cane
for a third foot
when they grow very old.
Very good!
Cracker, take them
to the Horseshoe.
It's here, umm...
somewhere.
We'll never find it in all this.
Everyone listen!
This horseshoe
has the power of light,
so that's what we look for.
You mean like
the one by Cracker's foot?
I'll get it out!
Uh-oh!
Look out!
You saved Cracker.
So I order a hole to be dug
to the Goblin tunnels.
There you will find
another Horseshoe,
stolen a long time ago
from the Blarks.
Thank you for your help.
No problem.
You are all the Blarks' friends.
Megan, look!
The Horseshoe is growing
brighter.
We must be nearing
the third one.
Now, what have we here?
Won't Ma be surprised?
We heard a scream,
what happened?
My hoof! Look at my hoof!
The beautiful polish
has chipped.
All that fuss over
chipped hoof polish?
I gave you the ancient recipe
for polish,
made from glitter scent.
But did you use it?
Then this is your fault,
Starburst.
I did use your polish.
Some Princess Ponies don't know
as much as they think they know.
I know enough to be Queen.
It takes more than just
knowledge to be the Queen.
Right! It takes the ability to
appreciate the beauty in things,
which I have.
What?...No.
To be the Queen,
a Princess Pony has to have--
A knowledge of every
part of one's domain.
That's not enough.
Starburst is right.
A Queen needs to have
a very special talent,
for understanding
her subjects...
like me.
No! no!
That is not what I was
going to say.
Hi! What's going on?
I'm going to be the Queen.
Oh! Some shortcut.
We've been walking for hours.
Okay, let's try again.
Which way leads to Dream Valley?
This way. -That way. -Yeah.
That way. -You bet.
Ah! Right. Okay.
What was that?
A light.
It was a light.
Yeah, it was. -I saw it.
Yeah, bright.
Come on. Let's go!
This isn't Dream Valley.
No, not Dream Valley.
No it isn't.
Not Dream Valley.
No.
Of course,
it isn't Dream Valley.
What is it then?
And who're you?
This is the Royal Paradise.
Only royalty lives here.
I am Princess Royal Blue,
a guardian of the magic wands.
Really?
Guardian?
Oh, my!
Imagine that.
Wands? -Wands, yeah.
It's true.
We are the Princess Ponies.
And it is our duty to protect
the magic wands.
And it is your duty to come
and judge the contest.
Contest?
Oh, boy, contest!
What's a contest?
Oh boy!
What contest?
The contest to decide
who will be Queen.
You shall be the judge.
You'll probably pick me.
Why?
Because I'm the best qualified!
What? You are not.
What makes you think you are?
You have some nerve! -You're so
rude! - I don't believe you.
Who should be Queen?
Well, Gee, I don't think
any of you really...
I mean
you're all so good.
Let's let the Bushwoolies
decide.
The time has come.
Sludge!
Yes, master.
Prepare for attack.
I want those magical wands, now.
Yes, master, right away, master.
Your wish is my command, master.
I should be Queen.
No, I should.
Whoever heard of the Queen
with dirty hooves?
I can fly and you can't.
So I should be in charge.
Gee, I remember
Paradise telling us
the legend
of the Princess Ponies,
and how they guard the
magic of Ponyland.
I never thought they'd act
like this.
Yeah, yeah, me too. -I agree.
Never. -Yeah.
It feels like an earthquake.
Oh, my!
What's happening?
Oh!
It's Lavan,
ruler of the Lava Demons.
Run!
Run. -Run. -Run.
Run to the palace. -Run.
Run!
Hurry, run!
I'll take these, ladies.
Give me your wand.
I'll fly out of reach.
Flying won't help you.
Ah!
Hey! You can't do that.
Is that the best you can do?
Yahh!
Hey, what happened?
-Where'd he go?
Where'd we go? -Yeah. Go.
They're gone.
Our magic wands are gone.
If Lavan tries to use the wands,
he might upset the magical
foundation of Ponyland.
Master, I know
it's not my place to ask,
but what are you going to do
with the magic wands?
They have the ability
to transform me,
into a crystal beam
of lava's power!
The power to do anything.
What a wonderful thought to be
a beautiful crystal creature...
You are a fool, Sludge.
Beauty does not matter,
only power matters.
Let the transformation begin.
Something's wrong.
Gwaaaaah!
If Lilac would just get
her hooves up out of the dirt
and get on her way, we'd...Ah!
Now what?
What is it, Megan?
I don't know.
Whatever it is, it's bad.
I can sense that.
Hey! What's going on?
Fizzy, this is no time
for jokes.
I didn't mean it, Megan.
It just happened.
Aaahh!
It was warm a second ago,
what's going on?
I figure that someone
or something has upset,
the magical powers of Ponyland.
Paradise! The fireworks
came from that way.
Right away, Megan.
I'll go investigate.
Sludge! Ready my lava board.
Mm-mm-my Lord?
The Ponies, fool.
I must capture
the Princess Ponies,
to learn how to use
the wand's magic.
What happened?
What we're afraid of...
Ponyland's magic
is breaking down.
Okay, someone's
got to get Megan.
And it's got to be you.
What are you doing?
Head for Paradise Estate,
find Megan.
The Bushwoolie will show you
the way.
You are all my prisoners.
Gotchya now, Locket.
Oh, this is exciting!
Faster, Locket.
Oh! Oh!
Catch it, Twilight.
Oh! I just don't know
who to cheer for.
You'll never catch me!
Tag, you're it!
Whoa! Whoa!
What was that?
Some kind of huge bird, I think.
And it looked like
something was chasing it.
But what would dare to chase
a bird that big?
Ooh! Come back here you!
Oh, please, please come back!
You're my last hope!
Look!
Who is that?
Oh, all is lost!
All is lost!
The poor thing.
Oh, oh, we simply must help him.
Come on, girls.
We'd better go see what
this is all about.
I have a feeling
we're gonna find out...
whether we want to or not.
Oh, woe is me.
Who are you?
You have wings.
Who you are doesn't matter.
Come with me!
Come on let's go!
Don't waste time.
Come on you...
But where are we going?
And why?
And who are you?
My name is Garth.
But does it matter
to you where we're going?
You have to come!
It matters to us!
We can't help you
if we don't know the problem.
Right, of course.
Well, my problem
is that my true love
is in an enchanted slumber
in a floating castle
that I can't catch.
Oh! How romantic!
You see my problem?
Well, actually...no.
It's like this.
Listen, can we at least get
moving while I tell it?
I'm in a hurry, you know.
Of course, we can, darling.
Oh, you poor tragic thing.
Let's go.
So, why do you need us?
To reach the floating castle.
See, my true love
is named Ariel.
Her father was a wizard
who cast a spell
that put her to sleep
in a floating castle.
Well, come on!
We don't have all day!
He did this, so only the man
who is in love enough
to brave the dangers
of the floating castle
reach the chamber wherein
she sleeps, kiss and awaken her,
will be good enough
to marry her.
Listen.
Wouldn't we reach this floating
castle faster if we flew?
Well, of course, we would.
Will you fly with me
and tell me about...
about your true love
and what you would do for her?
Is it much farther
to this castle?
It's here somewhere.
It moves around, so we'll have
to search a little, okay?
We'll find it, don't worry.
Won't we, Locket?
Locket? Locket!
Hey! I found something.
Look!
There it is!
It's certainly large.
How do we get in?
I don't know.
I've never been
this close before.
The legend says there
are challenges to be faced.
Well, then, let's go face them.
Hey! Where'd it go?
Did you see that?
I told you it moves.
Well, so do I.
It's too fast for me.
Locket, you try.
It's pretty high
up, Heart Throb.
If anyone can go that
high, it's you, Locket.
You can do it.
I have just got to sit down.
Come on, Twilight.
Wish me luck.
Go get it Locket!
Hurray!
Oh, this isn't going to work.
Of course, it will, somehow.
Not a chance.
Come on, Garth, cheer up!
We'll find a way in.
No, we won't.
You ponies can't fly fast
enough or high enough.
We can fly faster
and higher than you can.
Come on, everyone!
Make up now!
We all have to work together.
Work together!
That's it!
If we approach
from different sides,
one of us will be able to land.
Oh! That's brilliant!
Yeah!
We could do it like this.
Ready?
Go!
Hurray! We did it!
Let's go!
Move in and land!
Ah! Whoa!
What was that?
Part of the wizard's spell,
I guess.
It's supposed to scare us away.
Well, it didn't work.
Hang on!
Let us pass.
Ah! Oh!
Are you all right?
You're soaked.
I'm fine.
Maybe we'd better look
for another way in.
Let me try from up here
at one of the towers.
Hah! This'll be easy!
Easy, did you say?
It's hopeless.
We'll never get into the castle.
You must never say "never."
Remember your love.
She's there waiting
to be rescued.
Now come on!
We need a new plan.
Didn't you have some rope
in that sack of yours?
Yes, lots of it.
I thought so.
Now here's my plan.
Hurray!
We've got it!
Whoa! Whoa!
This isn't working!
Don't hold me so tight,
you're choking me.
Sorry. Bushwoolie
not want to fall.
Just tell me which way to go.
That way. Uh-oh!
Oh!
Oh no!
You will tell me
how to drain the magic
in the wands for my own use.
Don't be ridiculous.
That could destroy
all of Ponyland.
So be it. Take them
to the lava pits.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I am Princess Tiffany,
a keeper of the magic wands.
At least, I was.
You're one of the legendary
Princess Ponies?
Yes. And we need your help.
Our magic wands were stolen.
Wait. You'd better tell this
to Megan. Come on.
They can't throw us
into a lava pit.
It would ruin my complexion.
Let's play bounce, now.
Oh, boy, play bounce!
Yeah, bounce. -Play now.
Okay, bounce!
Now's our chance. Let's go!
No you don't!
That was fun. -Do it again.
Yeah. Yeah. -Yeah!
Quiet!
Huh...we've got to rescue
the Princess Ponies.
Yeah.
Rescue ponies.
Yeah, sounds like fun.
Yeah, fun.
Uh-oh!
Looks like we're the ones
who need rescuing.
You have a choice ponies--
jump, or be pushed.
All right. Everyone, run.
Don't mess with me.
I...I'm warning you.
Okay.
You asked for it.
Oh! He breathes flame.
He must be
one of the Lava Demons,
our hereditary enemies.
Uh-oh! I think
I just made a tactical error.
Hey! Wait a minute.
I'm a dragon, not a demon.
There's a big difference.
Would you be willing
to undergo a test to prove
you're not a Lava Demon?
Sure. You bet.
Uh, it won't hurt, will it?
Hey!
It's true, you are not a demon.
They can't stand our touch
anymore than we can stand
theirs.
Listen, we need your help.
We've got to rescue the
Princess Ponies from...Lavan.
Lavan has captured
the Princess Pony?
This is bad, very bad.
I will help you.
Come, there is no time to waste.
Oh, boy, are we lucky.
Paradise! You're back.
But who is this?
Megan, may I present
Princess Tiffany,
one of the keepers
of the magic wands.
Greetings your
majesty, I'm Megan.
Do you know what's causing
all these strange happenings?
It's a long terrible story.
And I'm so glad you asked.
It all started
when we lost the magic wands.
This is just awful,
all this mud.
Oh, it's not so bad.
We've got to keep searching.
There's more important
things to worry about now.
Look, everyone.
It's Spike!
Spike. Over here.
Hey! Princesses found us.
No, found them. -Found us?
Yeah. -Yeah -Yeah.
I'm so glad to see you.
You are?
Yes, indeed.
Now if only we can
find the magic wands.
Uhh, this is Gnash.
He...he says he can help us.
There are tunnels in here that
even Lavan doesn't know about.
We'll get the magic wands back.
It's worth a try.
Yeah, worth a try.
What's worth a try?
Yeah.
And so we need your help to
get the magic wands back.
This is serious, Megan.
The Jewel Desert is spreading.
Everything is
turning to crystal.
It'll reach Dream Valley soon.
Tiffany, I'll go with you
back to Royal Paradise.
The Rainbow of Light
is the only thing
that can restore
the magical balance.
There must be a way to release
the magic in the wands.
Maybe my own powers
are strong enough.
It's working!
Master, what's happened to you?
I told you I was
not to be disturbed, Sludge.
What do you want?
Your pardon, master.
But the Princess Ponies
have escaped.
WHAT?!
This is silly. We're
going around in circles.
Hush! We're inside the
walls of Lavan's chambers.
He may hear us.
I can feel the power within me.
All my senses
have been sharpened.
What's that?
I thought so.
Guards.
Seize them!
Our magic wands,
there they are!
Not so fast.
We're trapped.
An Ice Org, eh?
I should melt you into a puddle
right here.
Wait, master.
There's no need for that.
Quiet, Sludge,
or do you want another dose
of what I gave you before?
Then throw them all
into dungeons.
I'll deal with them later.
I'm tired.
I don't know if I can make
it back to Royal Paradise.
You've got to, Princess Tiffany.
The Rainbow of Light may
be Ponyland's only hope.
Whoa! What's going on?
The magic's going crazy again.
Hang on!
Oh! No! The Rainbow of Light.
There's got to be a way
out of here.
Don't any of the secret tunnels
lead into the dungeon?
I'm afraid not.
We're trapped.
Help! Run! Yeah, help, run!
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Run!
Sludge!
Ssshhh... Be quiet.
"Quiet?"
I'll give you quiet.
Come on!
Put 'em up!
Get him, Spike, Atta' boy!
Give him what for!
Yeah Spike! Get him!
Wait! I only wanna--
Ouch! Help!
Stop!
Why have you come here?
To help you.
We really believe that...
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, sure!
Listen! If Lavan
destroys Ponyland,
I will suffer along
with the rest of you.
I've suffered enough
at Lavan's hands.
Ice Orgs and Lava Demons
have always been enemies,
but...I believe you.
Uh...sorry about...
you know.
Oww! Ooh! Your hand...
It's so warm.
That's one reason why
Ice Orgs and Lava Demons
can never shake hands
and be friends.
Then let me
shake both your hands.
We can all be friends.
Thanks, Spike.
Thanks.
Now let's get out of here.
Let's go! Yeah! Got new friend.
Yeah! New friend, yeah.
What'll we do now?
The locket was our last chance.
We can't search anymore.
It's getting dark.
And I can't fly
much longer, Megan.
I'm exhausted.
There's one other chance,
the Moochick.
The Mushromp's that way.
Looks like the Moochick's magic
has gone funny too.
Oh, my-my-my...
What? Who is it?
It's me, Megan.
Hmmm. Let me see.
Doh...wait! Stop!
Come back here.
Oh... de-de-dear!
Sorry for the mess.
But none of my magic
seems to be working right.
Magic isn't working right
anywhere in Ponyland either,
and we've lost
the rainbow of light.
Oh, dear me!
Oh, that's very bad.
Ooh... very bad, indeed!
Here! Let me explain
what happened.
It all started when everything
in Paradise Estate went haywire,
and then...
Now!
Let it be complete.
Master, what has
happened to you?
Power!
That is what
has happened to me!
I've become the most powerful
creature in Ponyland.
Okay. Follow me.
No time for that, Spike.
C'mon!
Yeah, I know. I just thought--
That I'd be concerned
about how I looked?
Well, yeah!
I think now we're all aware
that there are more
important things to worry about
than our looks.
You bet!
Not that your looks
aren't important.
Yeah, important.
Real important!
What's important?
That's important.
Yeah, important.
Yeah.
I think we've all grown up
quite a bit
since the start
of this adventure.
Of course, I also still
think I should be Queen.
You? Don't be foolish.
I should be Queen.
That's absurd!
I'm the most qualified.
And you say Lavan stole
the magic wands?
Yes! Oh...
He's a horrible creature.
I am quite aware of just
how horrible Lavan is.
No wonder all the magic
in Ponyland is turning bad.
Mr. Moochick! Mr. Moochick!
Whoa! Ow!
It's eating everything in sight.
Can't you stop it, Mr. Moochick?
I'll try.
No! I was afraid of this.
My magic's not working right.
What do we do?
That's easy... run!
Aha!
Now what?
Well I seem to recall
something about...
Oh! No, no, no, no, no...
That wasn't it.
Hmm...
What's he saying?
I don't know.
Habbit, what is it?
Habbit, what are you doing?
He's going to feed
you to the plant?
Hmph!
He's doing no such thing.
He wants Megan to look
in the Book of Lost Answers.
"The Book of Lost Answers!"
That's it!
Are you all right?
Oh... fine, fine, fine.
But I can't seem
to get to the book.
There's got to be a way
around that plant.
Now...what is it rabbit's up to?
He wants us to
go around the house.
Let's go.
"The Book of Lost Answers"!
But how will we get it?
That's easy.
What does it say?
Oh! This is very bad.
To stop Lavan,
you need your magic wands.
Oh, my!
But we don't have
the magic wands.
We'll get them back.
What do we do with
the magic wands
once we have them, Mr. Moochick?
You must seek
the heart of Ponyland.
But how'll we find that?
It says, in your heart,
you know the way,
and then you must
all work together.
No one can save Ponyland alone.
Go now! You must hurry!
Are you sure this is
the throne room, Gnash?
Yes, I'm positive.
It's the throne room, all right.
No place else
in the world feels this mean.
Our magic wands...
What's wrong with them?
They've been drained.
Their magic is gone.
Not gone, little pony...
The magic of the wands
is right here.
It's Lavan!
Run! Yeah, run, run,
run, run, run, run...
Run, where?
This is end of your quest,
my Little Ponies.
Yaah!
Good return, Spike!
Get it, baby Tiddley.
Good one.
I got it, I got it.
Oh...Baby Tiddley-Winks.
Way to go, Baby Tiddley.
It's yours, Spike.
There, there!
Yeah, yeah,
it's all right, all right.
You all right, Baby Lofty?
Oh, it's okay.
No, this won't happen again,
will it Megan?
Not a big flame like this.
Well, Spike you're getting
to be big dragon now.
And I wouldn't be surprised
if your fire breathing powers
get stronger as you grow.
You'll just have to learn
how to control them.
Growing up isn't so great.
Hey, everything's okay.
Nobody got hurt.
I can't make it go out.
Spike, it's no big deal.
You're a dragon,
dragons breathe fire.
Swell.
Who's gonna show me
how to use my fire breath?
That's what I wanna know.
I can read up on dragons.
You know, their history
and everything.
Oh, books are one thing,
But what I need is experience.
I need to go find some dragons.
You mean, go on a quest.
But that could be dangerous.
Maybe so,
but the only way I can learn
how to be a dragon
is from real dragons.
Okay. But you're
not goin' alone.
Oh, maybe this wasn't
such a great idea.
We haven't seen anybody so far.
Much less any dragons.
Oof!
Who are you guys?
I'm Spike and this is Danny.
Are you all right?
Yes I'm all right.
I just don't know how to fly.
I was separated
from my parents a while ago.
And I've been looking
for them ever since.
If only
I could find...my parents.
I know what ya mean.
What's your name?
Weston!
Well, come with us, Weston.
After I find some dragons,
you can come back
to Paradise Estate with us.
Yeah!
Sure.
I guess it's better
than just waiting here.
Maybe we should
look down there.
This isn't quite
what I expected.
They look awful scary.
I've got to go talk to them.
Good luck looking
for your parents.
You want us to stick around?
Nope.
These are my dragons.
I have to face them on my own.
Good luck, Spike.
And what have we here?
If you please, sir,
I thought maybe if it wouldn't
be too much trouble,
you might allow me to
join your band?
Whatta we want him around for?
Little pipsqueak like him
would only get in our way.
Wait!
You wanting to join a
dragon camp is all very well.
But we dragons
have certain criteria,
which must be met.
We generously offer to protect
the citizens of a nearby village
for a token consideration.
The selection of their
best food stuffs and delicacies.
But the townspeople
have been slow to respond
to our magnanimous offer.
So a little visit is in order.
You may accompany us
so that we can judge
how good a dragon
you really are.
Help! Help!
You?
Me?
Yes, you. Pick that up!
This isn't right.
This is awful.
We've gotta stop 'em.
Come on,
let's go to Paradise Estate.
And then they marched
back to their camp
with all the food they'd stolen.
I think I'll just see
what they're up to.
Well! My boy.
What do you think of
the dragon life now?
Terrific, isn't it?
Of course, this doesn't
mean you're in yet.
Ya know, ya might have more fun,
if you were more like
my friends, the little ponies.
Little ponies?
Yeah, yeah.
The little ponies live
in Dream Valley
and play games all day
and make cookies and cupcakes.
Cookies and cupcakes?
And swim in the waterfall
and pick flowers.
Why... We'd love to visit
the little ponies.
Take us to Dream Valley,
and you'll be one of the gang.
Especially, if they
give us cupcakes.
They're coming here.
I think we should prepare a
proper welcome for 'em.
I have an idea.
What's this?
How did they know
we were coming?
Welcome, we've been
waiting for you.
Yes indeed.
We have a big meal
all ready for you.
With cupcakes?
I can't believe how easy
this is gonna be.
Move outta the way, Spike.
Smart move ponies.
Give us food and keep it coming.
Yeah.
Especially the cupcakes,
'cause if you don't
there's gonna be trouble.
Hey, wait a minute
these are my friends.
Not anymore.
You're one of us now.
Ah... cupcakes.
But you don't
have to be mean.
They'll share
everything they have.
We just wanna make certain.
Hey Guys!
Surprise!
And you can expect
more where that came from
if you start any more trouble!
Yeah, I wanted to learn
how to be a dragon, not a bully.
Go!
Let's get outta here.
Don't forget.
Okay, okay we're goin'.
Just havin' a little fun.
No sense of humor.
Boy, some people.
What's the matter, Weston?
Aren't you enjoying yourself?
Oh, yeah!
Everything's wonderful here.
It's just that...
Weston, look!
Mama! Daddy!
I guess I'll never learn how
to be a grown up dragon now.
But if being a dragon
means being a bully.
Nah! Look how many different
kinds of ponies there are.
Earth Ponies, Pegasi,
Flutter Ponies,
so there are probably all
different kinds of dragons too.
When the time is right,
you'll find the ones like you.
You really think so?
Well, then maybe for now being
here is the right place to be.
Anyway, I did learn
one thing from the dragons...
Yeah, what was that?
Everyone run for it!
You pushed me bagger.
No, you pushed me smacker.
You both pushed me,
and now you're stinking mean.
Oh! Dear, Ma...
Everyone hide.
Quickly!
Paradise! The Horseshoe's
illumination will reveal
our place of concealment
to the goblins.
Perhaps you can wish it off?
All Little Ponies,
we know you're here.
Yeah. We can read your minds.
You don't like us,
you think we're ugly and mean.
They're right.
Oh My!
The goblins just caught
North Star and Spike,
They seem to intuit their
precise locations.
What?
They know where they were.
I'm reading two more minds
right over here.
Ahhhh!
Ma is gonna be
so proud of me.
I got two and you guys
only got one.
And that's all there is.
I thought there was more?
Dummy, we'd read their minds
if there was.
Let's go show Ma...
If the goblins found everyone
by reading their minds,
why didn't they know
we were here?
Perhaps it's the Horseshoes,
they might cancel out
the telepathic power
of the Goblin's Horseshoe.
Then we can follow them
secretly.
Come on!
That's the 306th time
I won today.
Look what we got Ma...
I got two
and they only got one.
So? Wanna make something of it?
Both of you is thinkin' worser.
Alright, you two's been
asking for it.
Boys!
I like all your presents.
They'll make good little slaves,
and we need slaves.
But what would please
me and your Pa most
would be if you would
STOP FIGHTING!
Yes Ma.
Sorry Ma.
It won't happen again Ma.
We'll be good.
Why can't the three of you
learn to get along?
It's not my fault.
Don't look at me.
They're the ones who start.
Nuh-uh!
I'm Sorry.
I'm Sorrier.
I'm sorriest of all.
No you're not.
Excuse me!
Your sons fight because
the magic Horseshoe you wear
lets them read
each others minds.
If you free us, we will take the
Horseshoe far away from here.
Nonsense!
Goblins don't give things away.
Boys, Pa and I are going in
the back to count our treasures.
We don't want any more arguing,
you hear?
Yes Ma.
I wonder how Mimic is?
It doesn't look like
we could help her much now.
I've done all that
I can for her.
I'm afraid it's not much,
the only thing that can help
her now is the Horseshoes magic.
Well why can't you make
horseshoes for her?
I just might be able to,
but it would take too long
to return to my workshop.
I'll take you, I'll take you!
That's not problem.
It's no problem at all.
If any of us can get you there
in time, it's me.
I can get ya home in a wink.
I'm the fastest flyer here.
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.
Then, what are we waiting for?
It's Paradise and Wind Whistler.
Hey, whatÂ's the big Idea?
Who do you think
you're hitting?
Oh boy, are we glad to see you.
The Slaves are escaping!
See what your fighting has done?
Keep going, Lofty.
I'll catch up.
I've been robbed!
Ma we're sorry.
We'll get it back.
Oh yeah, Ma, sure we will!
I promise, I promise!
And I am sorry.
I was hittin' you guys.
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I punched you in the face.
Well, I'm sorry I was, you know,
jumping up and down
on your legs.
Oh!
Forget the Horseshoe boys.
We've got something better.
We got our family spirit back.
Bat's Wings... Tail of Newt...
Oh! Oh!
The magic involved is just
too strong for me to control.
Now where do we go?
According to the power
of this Horseshoe,
the last one is near
but up high.
Look up there
on that high peek.
I've been there,
it's the home of
the green mountain elves.
It's awfully high up.
Do you think we can make it?
The air's thin up there,
but breathable.
Let's go!
I-I hope the others can make it,
it's a long way down.
Northstar. Wind whistler.
Help!
Air is too thin...
I can't breathe...
Come on, we'll make it together.
It doesn't look friendly.
It was built to be deceiving.
Warm welcome Lofty to you
and your friends.
I am Cara, keeper of the gate
to the Mountain Elf Kingdom.
What quest brings you here?
We're looking for
a magic Horseshoe,
that can take you
wherever you wish.
We need it to save
our friend's life!
I'm sorry.
It is not within my power
to give it to you.
It belongs to the child,
Princess Mave.
And according to Elven Laws,
no one may take anything
from a child,
unless the child
surrenders it willingly.
May we ask Mave
for the Horseshoe?
Yes. I'll take you to her.
Oh!
Come to play with Mave?
No, Mave.
This is Megan,
she has a favor to ask of you.
Ask.
A unicorn is very sick,
your magic Horseshoe
is needed to cure her.
Will you give it to us?
No.
Horseshoe Mave's!
Fun to play with.
Watch!
Hey, wait...help!
See?
Horseshoe make fun for Mave
all day.
Now we go under the ocean
for more fun.
Uhh...let's not.
We've seen why you
want the Horseshoe.
Now let's go to Dream Valley
so you can see
why we need the Horseshoe.
Okay! Dream Valley.
Here. Pony needs Horseshoe
more than Mave.
Thank you! Thank You!
Megan? Megan!
We have all the Horseshoes.
Give them to me, quickly.
Mimic, are you better?
All better. Thank you all.
We did it!
I'll do it,
I'll do it!
You did it all right,
Sundance.
You ruined our sign.
Now we'll never
be ready for the party...
I only tried
to get the ball.
Oh no!
You can't
splash me, you can't.
Baby Moondancer!
I'm really sorry,
Baby Moondancer.
You all right?
That was fun.
Let's play ball!
I'll get it.
Come back.
Ball gone, Posey.
This is no time for games.
Get to work, Bushwoolies!
Take this to Catrina,
and whatever you do,
don't spill it.
There's hardly any left!
Spill it?
No, I won't spill it.
Uh-uh.
Here's your witch weed potion,
your queen-ness.
You furbrain!
You spilled my
precious potion...
Get me some more!
I spilled it.
I told you to be careful.
Now she'll get mad at me.
Too bad.
We're tired of being slaves!
We're going to escape.
Yay! Escape, escape,
escape, escape.
Did you say escape?
Don't drop me!
Please don't drop me!
I'll show you what happens
to Bushwoolies
who want to escape!
Couldn't he just
lose a privilege?
Yeah, a privilege, a privilege!
You have no privileges,
you're my slaves.
No!
How dare you betray me?
Bring me some more
witch weed potion!
She's really not so bad
once you get to know her better.
We don't
want to know her better.
Yeah, we don't want to.
Better hurry,
Megan'll be here any minute.
Can we
blow up balloons, Sundance?
No, but you can give
me that string over there.
Okay.
Uh-oh...
I'll save them.
Whoah! Oops!
Sorry.
You're so clumsy, Sundance!
Yuck!
Now I have to take a bath.
It's Megan
and Sky Dancer.
Hold tight, Megan.
As our guest of honour,
we want you to wear this.
The Rainbow of Light.
It looks after us,
and keeps us safe.
Thanks, I'll
take good care of it.
I'm Baby Moondancer.
I'm Baby Surprise.
I'm Baby Glory.
I'm Baby Cotton Candy.
Oh, look at you.
Please play with us.
We have nothing to do.
Oh, yes you do.
If you want to stay up
for the costume ball tonight,
you need your rest.
But we don't wanna rest.
Into the nursery you go,
and no more complaints.
We never have fun anymore...
I'll take care of them, Posey.
Hey, Megan.
We don't want to take a nap.
We want to play!
Okay, let's not take a nap.
You really mean it?
Sure.
Catrina's asleep
Now's the time to escape!
Escape, escape,
escape, escape!
Wait.
Let me talk to Catrina.
Maybe I can get you
shorter hours.
Shorter hours, yeah!
Too late for that.
Yeah, too late,
too late, too late, too late!
How about a week off
every summer?
Yeah, a week off, a week off.
No!
Shut off the witch weed machine.
What about better food?
A window so you can see out?
Yeah, a window,
a window, Good idea!
NO!
Bushwoolies unite!
Yeah, unite, unite.
Please, don't
do this to me.
Escape!
Rep?
Yes?
Do you hear anything?
...No.
Neither do I.
The Bushwoolies
have stopped working.
Actually, Catrina,
that's not exactly true.
Then they're still working?
Well, no.
They escaped...
Escaped?
How could they escape?
You were guarding them!
Where are they?
There's one.
There's another one.
They're too fast.
We can't catch 'em.
What am I going to do?
Who's going to make
my precious potion?
It's almost gone.
My new slaves!
Now, how shall I trap them?
Poor Catrina...
You've grown so cold.
That's it! Cold.
I'll make a snowstorm.
What's happening?
It's getting so cold.
I'm freezing!
Help!
That's enough, Catrina!
I can't move.
We're trapped.
I...I...I think I can get out.
Just a little more... there!
Get Megan and
the Rainbow of Light!
Ponies
We've gotta get these banners
and bows
and balloons
and things up.
You're certainly
on cloud nine today, Truly.
But of course, Paradise.
The Big Brother Ponies
are comin' home!
Yay!
Gee, what if the Big Brothers
don't make it on time?
Who knows what might
have happened to them?
And a year's an
awfully long time.
You're speaking of
the Big Brothers.
They'll be here alright.
And they'll be on time.
Surprise!
Hiya Buttons!
Wasn't that a good surprise?
Uh, sure!
Now help me replace
all these surprised balloons.
Do you hear something?
A bit louder, perhaps?
It sounds like a circus.
Now, Kyrie sing.
No, Somnambula,
please, don't make me.
Sing!
Let's see... What it is...
Paradise!
What are you doing?
You- aaoh!
But the party.
Oh well, It doesn't matter.
Lofty,
You can't! The Party!
Everybody, please don't do this!
We're gonna play this
when the big brothers cross
the finish line
So get it right!
You hear somethin'?
I surely do.
I hear the sound of
ya all not playin'!
That's enough, Kyrie.
Aaahhh...
I feel better already.
Welcome.
We thought
we heard...a circus.
And so you did.
We can go there if you like.
All you have to do is follow me.
Fourth down and five yards
to go, Steamer.
We're almost home.
Yeah! And I'm gonna ride
all over your rails
at the finish line, Score!
Ah, just think, Salty.
In a few moments,
we'll see Paradise Estate again.
Ah, after all this time..
Aye, matey.
We'll hoist our jib
and lay ha-hard into port.
Uh... right.
Reckon you're lookin' forward to
seein' them
little fillies when we get home,
eh Slugger?
Yep.
'Specially that there Buttons,
huh?
Yep...
Hm.. sure hope she can improve
your talkin' abilities some.
Yee-haw!
Gonna bust
your chops, Score.
It ain't a touchdown
till you pass the goalpost, Tex.
Uh...
Ho-ho-ho! Blow me down.
Where is everybody?
Maybe they forgot
we was comin'?
Ah, not the Little Ponies.
N-not Buttons!
They'd never forget.
I've got it!
This is all a gag.
All we gotta do is walk
through that door,
and they'll all
jump out yelling "Surprise!"
It's the big brothers ya all.
Uhh... You could jump out
and surprise us now.
Anybody home?
Ahoy?
There is something
seriously wrong here.
Who could imagine
we'd return
after all this time to find
Paradise Estate abandoned?
Devoid of life?
Silent.
You're here!
You're here.
Hooray!
Me happy.
What happened to everybody?
They heard
the sound of a circus.
And they all
just up and left.
Like they were in some kind
of trance or something.
I hear it,
but it didn't bother me.
Me heard it too,
but no make me go.
Hm...it sounds like it affects
just the Little Ponies,
and not the babies.
And not baby dragons.
What d'you think
we should do?
I think Truly and the others
should wait here.
While we go find 'em!
They're just so dashing.
And brave.
Oh, I do hope
they can rescue the others..
Ah...I can feel
my powers increasing already.
Now I can make all this real.
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes,
here it is!
The wonder kitchen
bake to your heart's content.
Step right up, folks.
The gardener's delight!
Oh boy, seeds!
Ice cream, ladies and gents.
All you can eat.
I'll have one of each.
We've been following
the Ponies' tracks all day
without a sign of 'em!
And it's getting dark.
We're gonna
have to bed down soon.
N-no! We keep searching.
No way, Slugger!
Why, in five minutes,
you won't be able to see
your own nose.
Now, Kyrie.
Sing for me.
No, Somnambula.
It's not right.
I have the power to make
my illusions real now.
Uh- ah- all right, all right.
Truly!
Come on! We've gotta stop her!
Hurry!
Oh, Truly, wake up!
Oh no!
Not big brothers, too?!
We gotta break their trance,
somehow.
Oh, I hate to do this,
but...let'em have it!
What in the Sam Hill?
What're we doing here?
Somebody knocked us
off the tracks.
It was us.
Oh! Wha-what's that singin'?
It's funny singing.
It makes all the grown-up ponies
act strange.
Even Big Brothers,
like they walking in sleep.
But where is it coming from?
Right there!
Slugger!
What're you doing?
Truly!
Ahh...oh, no!
Come back!
Hey, you okay good buddy?
Yup, I-I think so...
That's where we've gotta go.
It's from
the Palace de Branforr.
"You are cordially invited
to a weekend traleigh."
"Please bring the newborn
twins.
This party is in their honor."
Aww...
Newborn twins get to go
and we don't.
The party is for them
Baby Tic-Tac-Toe.
I'm sorry.
Newborn twins get
all the attention.
I say we do somethin' about it.
Well, we're all set
for the palace.
Look at me.
Quack!
I'm a duck.
Baby Quacker,
why are you going to
all this trouble?
'Cause only babies
get noticed 'round here,
are newborn twins.
Newborn babies
need a lot of attention,
Baby Quacker.
It doesn't mean we love 'em
any more than we love you.
Ah! The Little Ponies!
Entrer!
Have you ever seen
anything so glamorous?
Not since I looked in the mirror
this morning, darling.
A bedroom has been
prepared for you.
Dinner is at 8 sharp.
Bedroom?
This is more like a barn!
Pretty sumptuous for a barn,
if you ask me.
Pooh...
Too showy for my taste.
Have you seen my brother?
Can you help me rescue him?
Uh, we just got here.
Zey took him two years ago.
Where'd she go?
There's something fishy
going on here.
Dinner is served.
My Poochy wants filet mignon.
But of course,
Duchess, Monsieur.
It will be done tout suite.
Never mind that, just be quick!
Ah, mama,
I wish I could have ze nice pet
like what you got.
Ah, my petite-fille,
you will very soon.
Good evening, Duchess.
Who let those horses in here?
But mama,
zose are ze Little Ponies!
Oh, yeah, right.
Bonjour, Ponies.
We're honored, your High--
Good.
Let's get some grub,
I'm starvin'.
I need more cushions.
You see, ever since the
Duchess took ze zrone--
Watch it, buster!
Oh, dear, oh dear, excuse moi.
I mean since the Duchess
ascended to ze zrone--
Never mind.
I'm just happy
that the toot-sweet
Little Ponies are here
with their dear newborn twins.
Oh, but they're tired.
Take them to the Ponies' rooms.
By the way,
there was a strange
girl in our rooms earlier.
I thought you locked
Suzette in her room?
Uh, she must have escaped
thorough another secret passage.
You must've been seeing things.
Shall we dine?
I was not seeing things.
Watch yer' mouth, sister!
You could be put out
to pasture, you know.
Ah! Me got great idea!
Let's go to dumb ol' palace
and crash their dumb ol' party.
I-I don't think that's wise!
But if you're gonna go,
I'm going with ya.
I learned one thing tonight,
being upper class
doesn't make you classy.
Ooh, I can't wait to get
out of this dreadful place.
I say we just take the
newborn twins and--
The twins! They're gone!
Come on,
they couldn't have gone far!
Maemoiselles,
you are all under arrest.
We oughta show those
newborn twins who's boss!
This is awful!
We gotta rescue
the newborn twins!
Good luck.
I know every joist and timber
of this palace.
And there's no way
out of this dungeon.
I'm
the Prince Philippe de Branforr.
This is my palace.
Sorry, the accommodations
are unpleasant.
But the place has gone to seed
since my scullery maid
usurped the throne.
The Duchess is your cook?
Huh! I knew it!
You must help us.
The problem is getting through
that door.
You need ze key.
And ze key
is on ze guard's belt.
Buttons, can you get them?
I think so.
No good.
The belt!
Oh, me, oh!
Ouch!
This way.
Doh!
Oh, there is no way in.
Let's go home?
Me think hard enough,
there be way in.
See?
You must come with me.
This tunnel should
lead right to...
the palace guard.
Alons, vite, vite!
Regarde! Look!
Ooh! I'm so happy to have
ze pets like mama,
and we have
so much fun togezer.
No, no, Tumbleweed,
you are mine.
Not what we hoping
would happen to them.
Only now me not feel good
'bout hoping for it...
We gotta save 'em.
The guards! We must run.
We gonna let dumb guards
stop us from savin' newborns?
No!
Enguarde!
Heave-ho!
Well done!
Splendid!
Philippe, you're free!
Suzette, you're safe.
But some friends of yours
arrived,
ze First Tooth Ponies.
What?
And ze guards are after zem.
We must help zem.
No, they're not.
Charge!
Ooouch!
To Margette's room.
Forget those bratty ponies.
We gotta get the prince
back in the dungeon.
Too late, Duchess.
Philippe! Ze guards are coming!
Let them.
Seize them.
Seize them all.
Take a good look
at your Duchess.
This is how she treats innocent,
defenseless babies.
Men, who's side will you choose?
Hers, or zat of your true
rightful prince?
Long live Prince Philippe!
Alore!
And you, Duchess,
can have your old job back...
in the scullery!
You had to have a pet,
didn't you?
Little Ponies, you helped
restore me to my throne.
I owe you a great debt.
I'd say we're about even...
Come on, Sniffles,
take food from Baby Fifi.
Hmm... taste good.
This is not t-t-tasty
good food, Sniffles!
See Milkweed, nice ducky.
Quack, quack, quack
Go on...play.
Come on, snookums,
Baby Lickety-Split says
time to eat.
That does it!
Come on, we take
newborn twins for walk.
Walk, where?
The Satin Slipper Sweet Shoppe.
That keep them quiet.
Scoops...
Fudge sundaes, all around.
I am sorry, Baby Lickety-Split,
we're out of ice cream.
Ah! It unheard of.
That impossible!
It terrible!
Rocky Ripple has shut down
the Mixville Ice Cream Works
to drive Fudgy McSwain
out of business.
Fudgy who?
Fudgy McSwain. He runs
the Creamy Confection Foundry.
He makes all the ice cream
toppings in Ponyland.
They really hate each other.
And the saddest thing is they
used to be such good friends.
Then there only
one thing to do.
We gonna make those two
friends again.
Come on.
There it is,
Mixville Ice Cream Works.
Is the Rocky Ripple guy
gonna even listen to us?
You kidding, Baby Tic-Tac-Toe?
Bunch of cute kids like us?
He do anything we ask.
Never!
Fudgy McSwain's a thief.
I've spent years...
Oops! Wrong way.
I spent years developing
my greatest ice cream flavor
double banana, marshmallow,
colada...
And on the day
I'm ready to start
making my greatest creation,
the piece of paper
with the recipe disappears...
and Fudgy McSwain took it.
Hmm...
This be tougher than I thought.
The Creamy Confection Foundry.
Fudgy McSwain listen to us.
What? No!
Why should I crawl to him?
It's me that's owed the apology.
But Rocky Ripple just confused
'bout you that's all.
And our newborn twins
want their treat.
All right, then.
I'll speak to my old friend
and set things straight
for you ponies.
So you see, Rocky. I could
never have taken the recipe.
Without your ice cream,
I'd be out of business.
And I'd be willing
to help you look for it.
Old friend.
Old friend.
Yay!
So...you pretend
to be my friend,
so you can abuse me in this way?
Now see here.
See how you like it
when you're up to your eyeballs
in butterscotch topping!
We better get out of here before
we make any more trouble.
Fudgy, wait! S'il vous plait,
if you please?
Insult me, will he?
I'll teach him a lesson
he'll nay soon forget.
Fudgy, please,
this is not right.
Oh, no!
Quack, quack...
Goodbye.
Me know this must be fun full,
but...
I'll drown him
in chocolate syrup.
I'll destroy him
with chopped nuts.
We better warn, Rocky.
Rocky Ripple, you're finished!
Fudgy McSwain, use this.
It's no good.
Ice cream's 'sposed to
make people happy!
I've not yet begun to fight.
Why, you!
Ya quick frozen faker...
I'll plow you under!
Ooh-la-la!
We must stop this!
We gotta get newborn twins
some place safe.
Come on, we take 'em
to Satin Slipper Sweet Shoppe.
Why Satin Slipper?
No ice cream there.
It's just what I feared,
an all-out Ice Cream War.
Quack... Newborn Twins
hungry, Baby Fifi.
Well, there is plenty
of ze ice cream for them to eat.
No, they can't have that.
It's been on the ground.
Oh, well.
I was saving this
for a special occasion.
It's the very last ice cream
I have.
Oh, Milkweed dear,
everything all right?
have some nice ice cream.
What you got there, Milkweed?
The secret recipe!
Then Fudgy didn't steal it.
Rocky must have gotten careless
and dropped it
in the ice cream mixture.
Come on, gang,
we're gonna put a stop
to this silliness.
Ya marshmallow maniac,
I'll stop you
if it's the last thing I do.
Aye, and it'll be
the last thing ya do!
Ya double-dip dog!
Oh...wait!
They gonna destroy
each other.
Watch it! I need to stop it.
Baby North Star,
are you all right?
Look!
The recipe.
We find in carton
of your ice cream.
Uh, I guess I do get
confused once in a while.
Well, Fudgy, looks like
I owe you an apology.
Can ya ever forgive me?
Old friend?
Of course,
if ya can forgive me.
Now that's more like it.
I'll start makin' ice cream
again right away.
Aye, but what's ice cream
without toppings
me old chum?
We're back in business again.
And to show you
first-tooth Ponies
how grateful we are,
you can have all the ice
cream you want for free.
Me think me seen 'nuff
ice cream for one day.
Suddenly me have craving
for nice salad.
We're coming!
And I've got the rainbow.
Okay, rainbow,
do your stuff.
It's working.
The sun is coming out.
It's melting the snow.
Be careful, rainbow.
Look out!
The rainbow saved us.
It protected us, again.
Good work, rainbow.
I guess we'll have to
find some other slaves.
Nope, I want
those little ponies.
But how do we get past
the rainbow?
We'll get the rainbow first,
then the little ponies.
Dream Castle's so beautiful.
All that's left to do
is hang these balloons.
I'll help!
No thanks, Sundance.
You've done enough already.
Oh...
What'd she do wrong?
Everything!
Sundance is a very good jumper.
It's landing she's not so
good at.
Don't cry, Sundance.
Everyone goes through
a clumsy stage.
Even I did.
I've always been clumsy.
But you're a great jumper,
right?
I can jump farther
than any other little pony.
Well, that's wonderful.
Think of all the things
you can do that others can't.
Now if I wanted that
big juicy apple...
I can't reach it.
I can.
See... Great jump.
And you didn't crash
or anything.
Maybe I was just lucky.
You're not lucky,
you're special.
Gee... maybe you're right.
Maybe? Come on.
I can also get to the party
faster than you can.
Wanna ride?
Sure.
My turn. Let me look.
You just looked,
it's my turn now.
No, I wanna see.
Come on, Baby Ponies.
Time for the party.
Yay! Yippee!
Party time! Let's go!
Baby Moondancer,
where's your costume?
Don't have one.
Don't have anything to wear.
Well, let's see what we can
do about that.
There, you can go as a princess.
Need a gown.
A gown... Let's see.
How's that?
Pretty!
One more thing.
Gee, the Rainbow Locket!
Perfect.
Thank you, Megan.
Now go to the party.
I'll be there as soon as
I put on my costume.
Hello there, Princess.
Who are you?
I'm going to
the costume ball too.
My, what a pretty locket!
Can I see it?
Why?
Uhh... I-I'm a nurse
I have to examine it.
No...
Give me that locket.
No!
No!
Catrina!
I'll take that locket.
Help!
I'll take the locket... and you.
Help!
Give us a ride, Rep.
Help! Help!
Baby Moondancer.
Take off!
You're too heavy.
Hurry.
Help, Megan! Help me!
Help!
Where are they?
What if we can't find them?
They'd better not hurt
Baby Moondancer!
Who are you?
We're Bushwoolies.
What do you think?
How do we look? Do you like us?
I think they're cute.
Yeah! She likes us!
Yeah! We're cute!
Simmer down, Bushwoolies.
You aren't looking for a large
cat by any chance, are you?
Yes, we are.
And a funny looking creature who
can change into other things.
Catrina and Rep! They
went down that hole over there.
Yeah, down that hole! Yeah!
What's down there?
That used to be our home, 'till
Catrina made us her slaves.
We've got to get down
there and save Baby Moondancer.
And the Rainbow of Light.
Follow me.
Whoah!
Oh no!
I want you to be my slaves.
No!
If I spare the rainbow,
will you be my slaves?
No!
Then say goodbye to
Baby Moondancer.
Catrina, wait.
That's going too far.
Raaaaaaaaahhhh!
You asked for it, Catrina.
Agh!
Aaaaahhhhh!
Whoa...whoa!
I did it, Megan!
You sure did, Sundance.
Agh!
Help, Rep.
Help me!
I-I don't know, Catrina.
If only you could change
and be good again.
I can change.
I can be really good.
How do we know?
I-I'll prove it.
Just help me!
Okay... Okay,
if you destroy
the witch weed machine.
But that took forever to build.
Can't you think of
something else?
Wait, I'll do it.
But I need some more potion.
I'm... I'm out of power.
Here it comes, Catrina!
The machine, Catrina!
Remember what you said.
Would you please
help me out now?
Let the parade
of costumes begin!
You look beautiful, Catrina.
Do you really think so, darling?
Just like the good old days.
Go on, Catrina.
Your public awaits.
I'd be happy to, Rep, dear.
But you're standing on my dress.
Excuse me...
