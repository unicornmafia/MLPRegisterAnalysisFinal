you could jump out and surprise, 1
feel that the big bell we, 1
flories could be hiding anywhere even, 1
that i must do a good, 1
work without any glory or reward, 1
suffer along with the rest of, 1
a gift pony in the mouth, 1
well i 'm sure i have, 1
spoil the game for the rest, 1
back to flutter valley before sunset, 1

sometimes it 's hard not to, 1
my friend woebegone and you as, 1

we 've got to evacuate the, 1
shoo-bee-doo shoop-shoop-bee-doo shoo-bee-doo shoop-shoop-bee-doo what 's, 1
of visions did not show why, 1
see i come from grayvale a, 1
ya who to root for huh, 1
'll know it when you see, 1
was separated from them by accident, 1
right to turn them into glass, 1
moochick and the baby ponies have, 1
think has happened to our babies, 1
was face to face with the, 1
the heat that we 're here, 1
and he probably brought his bad, 1
n't suhelp you could well thanks, 1
gon na shatter you one by, 1
a lesson he 'll nay soon, 1
the lamp and i 'm obliged, 1
still get the sunstone back to, 1
meal might come if it comes, 1
ai n't like the old days, 1
that the boys are modeling for, 1
with nets and take them away, 1
got to reach the gates before, 1
like him would only get in, 1
we can catch squirk and crank, 1
the flutter ponies get the sunstone, 1
say tambelon then i woke up, 1
light is the most powerful magic, 1
it 's bumble and her swarm, 1
castle can pull away from these, 1
've got some marvelous plans for, 1
can stay where he is and, 1
could that be what they 're, 1
kind of what i had in, 1
i do believe it 's a, 1
happening to the baby ponies right, 1
and watcher of the crescent of, 1
n't trust me trust megan and, 1
and he used the energy from, 1
two 's been asking for it, 1
faster and higher than you can, 1
now has a heart of his, 1
and her bees to steal the, 1
we 've come to ask for, 1
was n't that a good surprise, 1
then what the crab nasties said, 1
no you ca n't and do, 1
ca n't seem to get to, 1
whistler fly faster than you 've, 1
wait till i get my hooves, 1
a queen needs to have a, 1
ta get these banners and bows, 1
i uh i think bumbleland 's, 1
brought all your fears to life, 1
how sister dear do you plan, 1
and the monster 's role is, 1
a nearby village for a token, 1
to speak to you for a, 1
get to the party faster than, 1
cookie and your future is in, 1
's the only way we 'll, 1
bumble and the bees would get, 1
now how shall i trap them, 1
we dragons have certain criteria which, 1
's going to wink herself to, 1
a good thing for me to, 1
mean honestly he really and truly, 1
in the world have you been, 1
now i 'm making my own, 1
hang on baby tiddly hang on, 1
they come we can be waiting, 1
and ask him to help us, 1
magic is n't working right anywhere, 1
and get on her way we, 1
her now is the horseshoes magic, 1
the situation to me on the, 1
but i ca n't swim very, 1
do n't wan na be alone, 1
on second thought maybe it 's, 1
favorite old toy over the hill, 1
something is not altogether ship-shape here, 1
your way now to begin your, 1
wherein she sleeps kiss and awaken, 1
which our magic wands draw their, 1
spent years developing my greatest ice, 1
n't wink through walls and that, 1
go to flutter valley and get, 1
she 'd be " it ", 1
like it affects just the little, 1
who thinks she 's been hiding, 1
there was a strange girl in, 1
'm forced to help zeb supply, 1
a hold this little whatever they, 1
talk to this niblick and ask, 1
well she thought it would be, 1
and erebus became even more powerful, 1
big and strong enough to keep, 1
's not like any illness we, 1
've got ta do is find, 1
me knight shade and i 'll, 1
send our very favorite old toy, 1
simple jumping drill like any self, 1
a cage of stone till we, 1
you just have to keep your, 1
thing to do is figure out, 1
's got to have some weakness, 1
some kind of squishy bug or, 1
tells what kind of wish the, 1
help you believed it would be, 1
only we can find the magic, 1
i 'd be concerned about how, 1
egg in your sandal and beat, 1
suppose it 's just a bit, 1
as the flutter pony who tried, 1
been fighting so long i guess, 1
it took him 500 years to, 1
i suppose i could sing a, 1
's get back to the estate, 1
's wed attracts misadventure the way, 1
ponies pegasi flutter ponies so there, 1
said that the scree gaze upon, 1
to himself and so using his, 1
up is a nice big ice-cream, 1
speed and the percentage of the, 1
got just what we 've been, 1
but i thought you left to, 1
your loveliness if woven into a, 1
actually believe that bad luck stuff, 1
's very kind of you rosedust, 1
have to do with us or, 1
i just got ta find buttons, 1
gets his feelings from the heartstone, 1
every inhabitant of ponyland in the, 1
the babies got back home alright, 1
ice orgs and lava demons can, 1
i said the flutter ponies are, 1
the sunstone from flutter valley and, 1
but you three will do for, 1

it 's not natural this time, 1
been terribly worried ever since the, 1
beezen ordered me to mop you, 1
for the real one maybe we, 1
got ta do is walk through, 1
guess hide and seek just is, 1
we ca n't give up hope, 1
my darlings we 've been trying, 1
what 's so difficult about that, 1
to make you feel all good, 1
unless you want to stumble round, 1
of the lamp and i 'm, 1
then that the shadows provided erebus, 1
he wind up back in the, 1
if only i could get out, 1
but we 're going to find, 1
oh ugh tomorrow we have to, 1
roll out the red carpet and, 1
that 's it wind whistler bring, 1
dare say it is freezing too, 1
're not going to find out, 1
legs in the morning two at, 1
been getting her youth from the, 1
you 're crazy if you think, 1
after us and keeps us safe, 1
so if we can keep him, 1
ca n't life be more like, 1
morning glory said there 's nothing, 1
but it 's more serious here, 1
'll be the last thing ya, 1
have to go all the way, 1
them to the black mountains the, 1
they are n't always what they, 1
sure they get good and clean, 1
's wrong but we 're not, 1
telepathic power of the goblin 's, 1
beginnin' to understand why all the, 1
to bring flutter valley back to, 1
she 'd know what to do, 1
the glassy wrath of the great, 1
there are probably all different kinds, 1
are you saying no to me, 1
we ever going to stop him, 1
something i can do that no, 1
doing what you did back there, 1
the moochick is the one to, 1
a dragon camp is all very, 1
hair to weave a fake magic, 1
nearly all is not good enough, 1
did drop my sweatband at the, 1
because of that their magic is, 1
we 'd only get thrown out, 1
n't know the water would dry, 1
you may decide what is and, 1
he well i never had a, 1
wonderful thought to be a beautiful, 1
to get the sunstone back to, 1
the satchel should be in one, 1
wanted some triple fudge nut caramel, 1
girls flutter valley will be wilted, 1
this must be where the raptorians, 1
are you sure this is gon, 1
day or do you wan na, 1
the right to turn them into, 1
seems to be the source of, 1
your help to get the magic, 1
they 're nice boys but they, 1
of us can get you there, 1
i thought maybe her horn could, 1
the way back in so we, 1
three heavy stone statues all the, 1
did stay for her horseshoes were, 1
you both pushed me and now, 1
believed it would be bad for, 1
terrific jumper and you can fly, 1
have taken years to put together, 1
'd better get out of here, 1
now i have to take a, 1
life it 's very hard to, 1
a while and only for special, 1
but what i need is experience, 1
a long journey just as the, 1
wo n't have anything to fear, 1
what any of these symbols mean, 1
'm ready to start making my, 1
come here to ask you that, 1
just looked it 's my turn, 1
or we 'll be back in, 1
will teach you not to steal, 1
to find water for the seaponies, 1
just rest easy for a while, 1
feet in diameter and the entire, 1
you ought to wait a few, 1
these terrible things are happening to, 1
like you 'll always be in, 1
that are big and strong enough, 1
any longer paradise estate would 've, 1
more dangerous down there than you, 1
greatest treasure of all a friend, 1
what will happen when the heartstone, 1
if tambelon changes slowly from the, 1
we got ta get newborn twins, 1
can we possibly save the rest, 1
the gem but i neglected to, 1
would 've done it for anybody, 1
no intention of giving them up, 1
threatened to turn ponyland into glass, 1
ripple just confused 'bout you that, 1
the three of you learn to, 1
you ca n't and do n't, 1
the darkening sunset a single lonely, 1
to do now is get out, 1
always wanted an ugly old place, 1
i got two and they only, 1
protect the heartstone which is the, 1
soon you 'll join him in, 1
you 're witches that 's how, 1
is it rabbit 's up to, 1
first place this never would have, 1
and i reckon this one 's, 1
if any of us can get, 1
have different roles in the land, 1
gon na find it up here, 1
did was to turn ponyland into, 1
what can i do that is, 1
broken my spell which means you, 1
dangers of the floating castle reach, 1
large cat by any chance are, 1
soon as she moves grab it, 1
you wo n't be able to, 1
and if we do n't get, 1
no one passes through the door, 1
seen the book i was reading, 1
the sun is going to set, 1
the ghost still here i think, 1
i can light the way with, 1
got to help us find them, 1
a star all he said he, 1
we must be nearing the third, 1
and- and- and-crunch the rockdog turned, 1
'll grow up to be your, 1
i say let 's help this, 1
you should n't be out after, 1
thought i 'd hear you say, 1
whistler how could you just go, 1
means my village has been restored, 1
i do n't think you will, 1
it would help any to say, 1
a place ruff knew squirk could, 1
you know their history and everything, 1
come down before you hurt yourself, 1
from somewhere and it normally comes, 1
the wizard 's spell i guess, 1
are happening to him but i, 1
to be a beautiful crystal creature, 1
upon one to see what will, 1
i have an idea hydia--whoa oh-hh, 1
perhaps i can be of assistance, 1
n't give back your babies ', 1
did you destroy the flashstone megan, 1
her cloak and i must say, 1
you would n't turn against us, 1
be good enough to marry her, 1
but we do n't wan na, 1
y'know gusty was on the right, 1
that golden door that the beast, 1
helps the little ponies when they, 1
for so long it is refreshing, 1
and we think it 's due, 1
covered with 2 tons of chocolate, 1
got me mad that 's all, 1
there was this coin with a, 1
the troggles return them to the, 1
like it 'll last forever does, 1
a look at that home of, 1
away from lavan and his demons, 1
gosh i did n't say that, 1
he 's not gon na hurt, 1
how can you ask a question, 1
there 's one other chance the, 1
think i might be able to, 1
we get the heart of fire, 1
round in the dark for all, 1
ponies and you 're going to, 1
we 're going to make him, 1
but would n't it be more, 1
i think it 's baby ribbon, 1
of you and your friends knight, 1
of us can start digging firebreaks, 1
right have some nice ice cream, 1
enough excitement for one night thank, 1
underneath and--what 's happening to my, 1
can do it ourselves that 's, 1
happening to him but i just, 1
undo the spell before we find, 1
will not fail you again erebus, 1
a heart of his very own, 1
ma'am you 've got to believe, 1
out a way to get the, 1
i ca n't go nowhere 'til, 1
separated from them by accident last, 1
the crack and make it bubble, 1
wo n't let you hurt my, 1
but there 's nothing i can, 1
i was saying i got rose, 1
to spoil the game for the, 1
and there she did stay for, 1
even with the troggle 's help, 1
the power of blazing light ", 1
's like all their magic powers, 1
's the princess that all this, 1
short hours you with the rest, 1
boy are we glad to see, 1
they 're completely helpless that way, 1
or we 'll never get our, 1
to 4 feet in diameter and, 1
we had the sunstone it would, 1
'll get even with those flutter, 1
to destroy the estate to get, 1
the little ponies and their friends, 1
somethin' bad might happen to ya, 1
course you probably do know the, 1
done is n't so nice either, 1
after us and used up his, 1
listen--i 'm afraid we 're doomed, 1
now to begin your new life, 1
you 're big like a dinosaur, 1
water mysteriously sank back into the, 1
long claws of the law are, 1
this little whatever they 're called, 1
some really awesome techno-stuff in here, 1
and visit the new kingdom of, 1
you may even have this can, 1
blue your robin 's egg blue, 1
bad once you get to know, 1
of light is the only thing, 1
aah i shall report you to, 1
i shall fly overhead and guide, 1
that to the rest of 'em, 1
g-g-go south for the w-winter and, 1
i ca n't even see my, 1
and pick us off or he, 1
then without it he 's turning, 1
is figure out a way to, 1
've been looking for them ever, 1
take 'em to satin slipper sweet, 1
think i wan na be stuck, 1
all the grundles that are left, 1
the crescent fell from the sky, 1
's a huge ruby in the, 1
looking for a large cat by, 1
head for the purple mountains you, 1
the way an old bone attracts, 1
what happened to that old witch, 1
i must capture the princess ponies, 1
two keep looking from the air, 1
flutter valley by sunset flutter valley, 1
that when you read my mind, 1
i just thought--that i 'd be, 1
you called me to come back, 1
yours arrived ze first tooth ponies, 1
figure out how to rescue them, 1
is screera north star where are, 1
i can feel the power within, 1

escape or i could have run, 1
to brave the dangers of the, 1
i got it i got it, 1
n't wan na be alone megan, 1
the power to make my illusions, 1
we do n't believe in curses, 1
merely refrain from expressing them at, 1
run for the moochick 's cottage, 1
uh if you want to rule, 1
through stuff like this net you, 1
with 200 scoops of rocky road, 1
amulet the flashstone to punish them, 1
expressing them at the drop of, 1
's put one over the door, 1
thing that would cheer me up, 1
have to play in a village, 1
the good life it 's very, 1
have to find another way in, 1
be no place for anyone but, 1
let 's let the bushwoolies decide, 1
been surrounded by these romantic idiots, 1
to reverse the effects of the, 1
but as for you scorpan you, 1
ponies are missing but we 're, 1
in the earth pony jumping finals, 1
in readiness master as you ordered, 1
guess we better split up and, 1
and he 'll fold up like, 1
'll search the entire estate and, 1
if you do n't there 's, 1
's something weird about all this, 1
in the back to count our, 1

paradise and north star you come, 1
we can fly faster and higher, 1

danny likes to skip on the, 1
wan na be backup singer for, 1
decided to give you a little, 1

nobody 's getting into this valley, 1
by getting to the moochick and, 1
not exactly certain what will happen, 1
never see my grandfather again ever, 1

fearsome creature ever known terrorized ponyland, 1
we can find his elevated eminence, 1
than just an antique heart throb, 1
golden rose in the haunted garden, 1
very sick your magic horseshoe is, 1
into scorpan when he took over, 1
rainbow of light may be ponyland, 1
we reach this floating castle faster, 1

you change shape and get us, 1
take them to the lava pits, 1
dropped it in the ice cream, 1
but they 're not for me, 1
but we dragons have certain criteria, 1
my shadow which would end my, 1
probably find the source of this, 1
now baby cuddles you just close, 1
near and far so arm yourself, 1
the rest of you protect the, 1
's fix these crabies once and, 1
hoist our jib and lay ha-hard, 1
honour we want you to wear, 1
there is something seriously wrong here, 1
we 're all much better off, 1

bet all he needs is a, 1
you helped restore me to my, 1
lemme explain while we go back, 1
i 'm afraid gusty 's gone, 1
to lose by following her what, 1
all that fuss over chipped hoof, 1
it look like i need another, 1
by these romantic idiots for so, 1
from my parents a while ago, 1
till i get my hooves on, 1
do n't you ever underestimate yourself, 1
is what you were so afraid, 1
i 'm making my own decisions, 1
shall fly overhead and guide the, 1
you think they 'll hurt us, 1
looking for a magic horseshoe that, 1
is it getting warm in here, 1
his pony friend are going to, 1
the flutter ponies need your help, 1
going to feed you to the, 1
there 's nothing i can do, 1
we ca n't take any to, 1
kind of wish the coin grants, 1
like to have someone gnawin' on, 1
if that 's how you want, 1
be my prisoners and do what, 1
what if the big brothers do, 1
" the legend of the four, 1
to the setting sun and the, 1
w-w-what do you mean " beings, 1
up back in the realm of, 1
they look pretty sick to me, 1
besides maybe i 'll get a, 1
one to see what will be, 1
they do is snort dig up, 1
're never gon na find that, 1
ooh no no no no ooh, 1
and tough as he was refused, 1
face to face with the old, 1
tyrant all right an evil and, 1
we could just get the honey, 1
when you see a seed it, 1
you mean like the one by, 1
afraid you see since the treasure, 1
blue your royal blue or blueberry, 1
but i did n't know this, 1
you do n't go messing around, 1
zeb stole more shadows and erebus, 1
have the most treasure so far--everything, 1
the barrel the balance of nature, 1
i do n't have any magical, 1
will turn all of ponyland into, 1
why did you destroy the flashstone, 1
back to paradise estate and check, 1
huh too smart if you ask, 1
light " the third made another, 1
when north star brings megan she, 1
certainly on cloud nine today truly, 1
suppose i could sing a different, 1
'd like to tell us why, 1
you use your powers on it, 1
we 'll hoist our jib and, 1
and the coin glowed and dematerialized, 1
sun sets flutter valley will be, 1
i 've been surrounded by these, 1
work making rough lumps of rock, 1
a second ago what 's going, 1
enough of us to carry everybody, 1
she 's been hiding from us, 1
reckon this one 's bigger than, 1
okay pluma you know what to, 1
some little ponies look a little, 1
" long ago in the land, 1
we sha n't be able to, 1
and as he chased he went, 1
and i mean a huge one, 1
we wo n't have any problem, 1
turn 'em over on their backs, 1
the baby ponies have been captured, 1
ago in the land of argyte, 1
our dell and the entire forest, 1
so you see i could n't, 1
you 'll grow up to be, 1
considering how ugly these caverns are, 1
to tell you to leave us, 1
decide what is and is not, 1
waiting for my grandfather to get, 1
us and used up his energy, 1
has n't been just an accident, 1
n't they know we were here, 1
uh-oh sorry sorry did n't know, 1
erebus had done i refused to, 1
and the door wo n't even, 1
wonder where the little ponies are, 1
shall be plagued no more the, 1
a seed it 's hard to, 1
come on we 'll make it, 1
'cause only babies get noticed 'round, 1
you ponies ca n't keep nothing, 1

storm and i 'm outta here, 1
dare you interrupt me with this, 1
get lost in here real easy, 1
part of the wizard 's spell, 1
well i guess we better split, 1

the greatest flying pony of all, 1
just do what bumble tells me, 1
well we thought you might be, 1
about the giant that goes boom, 1
helped restore me to my throne, 1
world and even if i did, 1
thing for me to have had, 1
glory what 's done is done, 1
lovelies i 'll take you to, 1
but one thing is necessary flutter, 1
i could have helped them escape, 1
that you have to come and, 1
rainbow of darkness that darkness sends, 1
you 're up to your eyeballs, 1
a wonderful day for a picnic, 1
midnight as you should have known, 1
i 'd never have any hope, 1
and go back to flutter valley, 1
he 'll steal my shadow which, 1
return at once for we must, 1
just do n't know how to, 1

waiting a lifetime for this sting, 1
from lavan and his demons now, 1

scorpan when he took over my, 1
more than all the magic coins, 1

back flutter ponies and you 're, 1
this one 's bigger than most, 1
i promise we 'll bring you, 1
this meteorological debacle is quite anomalous, 1
mm it 's too bad we, 1
to understand why all the little, 1
valley used to be my home, 1
up out of the dirt and, 1
a place filled with the best, 1
what 's wrong with bein' a, 1
the sheriff can circle through the, 1
i 'm cured of my bad, 1
started when i was just a, 1
'm gon na let ya live, 1
and you can expect more where, 1
to get any bubble in them, 1
the moon 's made of green, 1
wo n't let anything bad happen, 1
long long time ago the most, 1
and this place sure could use, 1
a little fun have some excitement, 1
coming closer and closer and closer, 1
-you 're so rude i do, 1
'm afraid it 's not much, 1
find a way to dry up, 1

for the beautiful golden rose in, 1
i 'll be down here waiting, 1
real big and strong because of, 1
n't throw us into a lava, 1
here any time for the flowers, 1

a huge ruby in the crater, 1
i thought you might need me, 1
little dust would n't have much, 1
without new magic i wo n't, 1

it 's better to just turn, 1
to do but play all day, 1
dump me but got dumped herself, 1
a lovely climate will be frozen, 1
i 'll get back to them, 1
to chase a bird that big, 1

stop those sentries or we 'll, 1

give that obnoxious rockwhatis a piece, 1
but it 's the best i, 1
one of them for your husband, 1

this sure ai n't like the, 1
that cloud so far away they, 1
been there it 's the home, 1
ponies go and i 'll apologize, 1
the bushwoolie who was lost in, 1
useless and they 're probably mad, 1
easy for you to say gusty, 1
says that when it 's rung, 1
and save the other flutter ponies, 1
of my mind for some time, 1
it 's a long way down, 1
my mind for some time now, 1
i guess you 'll be on, 1
n't think i 'm going to, 1
'll have to rely on galaxy, 1
i 'm now master of paradise, 1
myriad springs and rapids in ponyland, 1
and it gets louder the higher, 1
ponyland will never be the same, 1
's landing she 's not so, 1
declare friends may have to leave, 1
getting out of here right now, 1
c'm on ya all let 's, 1
n't fall in the water danny, 1
who tried to dump me but, 1
'm going for the double loop, 1
do n't want to lose her, 1
one thing tonight being upper class, 1
we have a proposition for you, 1
know what 's causing all these, 1
collapsed but no one was hurt, 1
n't you remember what happened the, 1
to go way to go north, 1
might like this material that the, 1
said he was a wizard and, 1
the legend says there are challenges, 1
so if there 's still time, 1
i 'm not half so good, 1
they 'll always be with ya, 1
that peddler and prey he knows, 1
them to the ponies ' rooms, 1
without some more sunlight the sunstone, 1
n't you think that 's enough, 1
but paradise--have n't you ever heard, 1
to honor you with this medal, 1
have to learn how to control, 1
your little friends back in ponyland, 1
sleeps kiss and awaken her will, 1
i 've spliced the tape together, 1
do n't make me do it, 1
but those crab things do n't, 1
the most fearsome creature ever known, 1
rockdog to protect the gem but, 1
ask a question like that at, 1
is a surprise i do n't, 1
now let 's get a look, 1
castle and swipe his rainbow of, 1
you wo n't be listening to, 1
come here any time for the, 1
no fever her tongue is n't, 1
you gon na do to draggle, 1
do n't remember why we 're, 1
my radiance my own extraordinary indescribable, 1
after all this time to find, 1
's just a bit too cold, 1
's because i 'm ruler and, 1
to let them go and give, 1
shadows being an outward sign of, 1
to congratulate my friend woebegone and, 1
it is just a story after, 1
too bad that i lost the, 1
n't really wan na hurt us, 1
one in memory of the bushwoolie, 1
's guarded by a series of, 1
closer and closer " boom boom, 1
what should i test it on, 1
someone who 's asked to see, 1
every part of one 's domain, 1
they would n't do anything bad, 1
and we 'll lead you to, 1
like this material that the boys, 1
might as well see what the, 1
good thing for me to have, 1
hope the others have better luck, 1
turn you all into glass and, 1
flutter valley will be wilted and, 1
oh i never get nothing to, 1
's never done us any harm, 1
it when you see it and, 1
could go with you because we, 1
in there and show that furniture, 1
the first team to return with, 1
find it we ask it to, 1
the estate and i just could, 1
the flutter ponies to defeat the, 1
the only one who 'd live, 1
powers on it to get us, 1
's not worth it any more, 1
n't for those creatures guarding it, 1
of course but what should i, 1
make it bubble it would expand, 1
a dungeon will look nice compared, 1
will i jump far like bow, 1
a storm clear up that fast, 1
you want to sing backup for, 1
we 'd better get this back, 1
she did n't mean to disobey, 1
believe your deeds both good and, 1
now what are we gon na, 1
now that she 's put down, 1
and as i became famous more, 1
stuff did n't really say that, 1
i seem to recall an ancient, 1
i mean honestly he really and, 1
shadow is just right for my, 1
i think we 've all grown, 1
to be a great flier baby, 1
have ze pets like mama and, 1
and we let him get away, 1
hello mimic how are you feeling, 1
hurry we ca n't hold it, 1
and it was through that golden, 1
making my greatest creation the piece, 1
you promise to undo the wishes, 1
'll see if i can find, 1
being upper class does n't make, 1
's no way we could stop, 1
n't happen again will it megan, 1
the only way we 'll ever, 1
yes yes that is more like, 1
's not natural this time of, 1
what bumble tells me to do, 1
we 'll find his elevated eminence, 1
is the lamp that lights our, 1

here with lickety-split and knight shade, 1
you are king you 'll understand, 1
ta know if she 's okay, 1
aye and it 'll be the, 1
i did n't tell you the, 1
what she told me to do, 1

i do have to check with, 1
n't you unicorns just disappear and, 1
what if these things are guarding, 1
it have to do with mimic, 1
quite a bit since the start, 1
a dungeon can do to your, 1
a row if you pull up, 1
we 'll get the rainbow first, 1
to make them pay for stopping, 1
i was face to face with, 1
they 're too big for us, 1
how he does that-it 's a, 1
bull bet you ca n't catch, 1
maybe he 's got some word, 1
sons fight because the magic horseshoe, 1
oh they 're too too heavy, 1
'll always be your friends woebegone, 1
comforts of modern technology like habbit, 1
's always coldest oh yeah right, 1
oh sounds like it 's working, 1
is not t-t-tasty good food sniffles, 1
've still got 20 sets to, 1
and the bees would get the, 1
have a very special talent for, 1
probably just had a little too, 1
well the poor creature did n't, 1
make you feel all good inside, 1
shoo-bee-doo shoop-shoop-bee-doo shoo-bee-doo shoop-shoop-bee-doo oh so, 1
when you see it and that, 1

way and then you must all, 1
and when was the last time, 1
well i 'm sorry i was, 1
your mothers i 'd bring you, 1

it 's too far for me, 1
they do n't think they have, 1
cuddles why do n't you run, 1
all that complaining you were doing, 1
i think it 's because they, 1
have this can as a free, 1
this is n't quite what i, 1
can fly and you ca n't, 1
and i promise we 'll bring, 1
would only get in our way, 1
habbit and i will look after, 1
a. that was the best landing, 1
'm pretty sure we 're tough, 1
a good idea at that time, 1
you 've got to admit it, 1
where we 're gon na go, 1
you another treasure do you promise, 1
understand why all the little ponies, 1
i guess i 'll never learn, 1
telling you there is no ghost, 1
had it in you all the, 1
i think we ought a help, 1
could get lost in here real, 1
you could have supplied me with, 1
be the first to feel the, 1
lava rock from the roiling depths, 1
to make you a saddle with, 1
you 'd better tell this to, 1
i do get confused once in, 1
of your little friends back in, 1
'll show you what happens to, 1
jumping up and down on your, 1
maybe one of us can sneak, 1
if you stop cooperating you will, 1
gracefully through the sky and play, 1
closer and closer and closer ", 1
flutter ponies to help us help, 1
our magic wands draw their power, 1
truly wind whistler 's right we, 1
i thought you were staying behind, 1
come to ask for your help, 1
he sent zeb along to do, 1
showed the future " the second, 1
but we do n't have the, 1
just a teensy bit guilty about, 1
never return and i wo n't, 1
aww why you have to go, 1
youe and it 'll come from, 1
that side of the bed shady, 1
ya stop believing it it 'll, 1
're gon na have to find, 1
things like this are always happening, 1
that 's why they got kicked, 1
we do n't get the sunstone, 1
seaponies except surf rider and water, 1
then i 'm gon na shatter, 1
i know enough to be queen, 1
so that we can judge how, 1
back that 's exactly what i, 1
guess it 's like when you, 1
through a simple jumping drill like, 1
everything i try turns out wrong, 1
i refused to work for him, 1
but it would take too long, 1
megan i do n't wan na, 1
never make it to the little, 1
a lot to be said for, 1
put any heart into crunch himself, 1
i was saving it for my, 1
long journey just as the sun, 1
crumbled your own cookie and your, 1
i have a wonderful mother but, 1
flutter ponies and you 're going, 1
circling and wait for our signal, 1
as far as i can ascertain, 1
figuring out a way to keep, 1
and and turn them into glass, 1
through the sky and play with, 1
squire alonso am here to rescue, 1
down there and save baby moondancer, 1

how to use my fire breath, 1
shadow and he laughed at me, 1

you fly with me and tell, 1
well of course i do n't, 1
would n't want anyone to think, 1
by sunset it will wilt away, 1
the sun was doing when he, 1

that my true love is in, 1
from the roiling depths of the, 1

dragons you can come back to, 1
wind speed and the percentage of, 1
you did it all right sundance, 1
we 're never gon na find, 1
i never get nothing to do, 1
i sure hope the others have, 1
it 's not much the only, 1
makes me so proud to hear, 1
steal my shadow which would end, 1
ca n't squeeze through the bars, 1
if we ca n't find them, 1
to have loved ones who care, 1
promise to leave us alone bumble, 1

is too small to pull my, 1
and seek just is n't a, 1
've longed to find one so, 1
hope of restoring grayvale and my, 1
think we 'll need the flutter, 1
have a new place to live, 1
red carpet and give them all, 1
the way back to the volcano, 1
do you mean " beings ", 1
no place in ponyland where you, 1
looks like i shall have to, 1
and grow all the flowers you, 1
this better not be a trick, 1
[ all gasp ] what in, 1
anyway i think i just might, 1
are n't looking for a large, 1
i 'll drown him in chocolate, 1
the moochick 's magic has gone, 1
not even when we have harvested, 1
teach you how to be a, 1
lickety-split would like a 200-foot sugar, 1
going to make him give those, 1
it started when i was just, 1
from if you start any more, 1
afraid we 're stuck flutter ponies, 1
they always catch princesses and hold, 1
see since the treasure belongs to, 1
'll find a way to stop, 1
it 's a wonderful red ball, 1
i had to destroy the estate, 1
back in the realm of darkness, 1
but what do you get out, 1
we have to stop those sentries, 1
things in this world we have, 1
important thing is that we 're, 1
can happen to my true love, 1
i did n't expect them to, 1
there are challenges to be faced, 1
at least i could before my, 1
counting on me to be a, 1
you wake up you can have, 1
man who is in love enough, 1
has upset the magical powers of, 1
let 's tell the other unicorns, 1
come on let 's go home, 1
the queen a princess pony has, 1
terrible things are happening to him, 1
will solve all your household problems, 1
show you what happens to bushwoolies, 1
they but await my special signal, 1
that can be anything you want, 1
sorry i think i 'm allergic, 1
had no idea that something would, 1
ze pets like mama and we, 1
use someone who likes to clean, 1
back on our roots in no, 1
it went fast with your help, 1
but they 're really light on, 1
this place is full of bad, 1
but do n't you touch anything, 1
the way out of the orchard, 1
but the spell was n't my, 1
'll take you to him megan, 1
'll always be with ya in, 1
ponies live in dream valley and, 1
uses to make me do what, 1
you might allow me to join, 1
nothing to do but play all, 1
this was n't such a great, 1
so you see i got ta, 1
that 'll stop any bad luck, 1
as no one passes through the, 1
's come to show us the, 1
we will be too unless we, 1
you 've got to let me, 1
of these here ponies possess magical, 1
air 's thin up there but, 1
coin with a mask on it, 1
there i thought my bad luck, 1
the castle without any trouble if, 1
the secret tunnels lead into the, 1
'd better give our babies ', 1
walk as adults and they use, 1
let 's get down to business, 1
oh it 's getting so hot, 1
i think these hedge animals are, 1
depths of the volcano of gloom, 1
your closet when you were three, 1
they found a way to make, 1
only the man who is in, 1
i guess we better split up, 1
maybe we should all go back, 1
to undergo a test to prove, 1
've gone as far as we, 1
i 'm megan a friend of, 1
plan a. that was the best, 1
course it is n't dream valley, 1
well you have the most treasure, 1
show you who 's too old, 1
your d-d-dad knows why it 's, 1
sun was doing when he had, 1
himself long enough we should be, 1
than prince charming can help being, 1
thought they 'd act like this, 1
they have a holiday here it, 1
of the orchard 's this way, 1
we wan na thank you for, 1
i know i know it 's, 1
suhelp you could well thanks anyway, 1
over now that ariel 's awake, 1
do n't know if i did, 1
soon the whole land will be, 1
have you out of there in, 1
door wo n't even let us, 1
maniac i 'll stop you if, 1
grow up to be your own, 1
should be getting close to flutter, 1
from turning ponyland into a giant, 1
here until they give us the, 1
we going to put up with, 1
find one so fair as you, 1
all left the land of legends, 1
power of my icy cold stare, 1
could do something to save heart, 1
a would-be dragonslayer he was n't, 1
gate to the mountain elf kingdom, 1
think what might happen this time, 1
horseshoes have been carried farther and, 1
" sound clear and loud and, 1
forget-me-not and i are the only, 1
" once upon a time there, 1
and gnomes have powers over earth, 1
perhaps we can retrieve the gem, 1
get out of here i could, 1
shall deed by my deeds not, 1
magnified by this machine it creates, 1
also get to the party faster, 1
north star i hope you 're, 1
you think of the dragon life, 1
want is a perfect day so, 1
not natural this time of year, 1
this land- every place around here, 1
okay shady whenever you 're ready, 1
's all very interesting mr. moochick, 1
you miss him too do n't, 1
asking you to let them go, 1
to put any heart into crunch, 1
i wonder where the little ponies, 1
maybe you 'd like to tell, 1
should be able to beat him, 1
ever gon na find it up, 1
it 's all right if you, 1
notice how much hair the bushwoolies, 1
i 'll bet she was separated, 1
friends were in no position to, 1
i need a knight who wo, 1
i thought once we caught up, 1
energy that gave him his magical, 1
of the bed shady on this, 1
and i 'd be willing to, 1
they ca n't give us anymore, 1
we got ta rescue the newborn, 1
do something to save heart throb, 1
except for a tiny pain in, 1
fun if you were more like, 1
got to practice if you 're, 1
no do n't make me do, 1
i only wish i can make, 1
's so old he ca n't, 1
here she 'd know what to, 1
see where did i put that, 1
recourse is to make a run, 1
her brother and his pony friend, 1
but if you 're gon na, 1
and strong because of the wish, 1
you know where the other half, 1
really collapse the moon 's made, 1
bring you back a treasure of, 1
're really light on their feet, 1
n't break it molly you 're, 1
them little fillies when we get, 1
we can go up for a, 1
you because we do n't want, 1
but feel that the big bell, 1
is in an enchanted slumber in, 1
gallop away into the darkening sunset, 1
i do n't think he 'll, 1
my little ponies what a pity, 1
i have the power to make, 1
'll blind 'em with a small, 1
and only steam-powered multi-tasking double-ant whistle, 1
if you do n't believe it, 1
long enough for you to eat, 1
means you did n't betray us, 1
goblins found everyone by reading their, 1
and their friends have been captured, 1
oh do let me play too, 1
it looks like we 're trapped, 1
place to put a light bulb, 1
you told me to make it, 1
to do is cool it off, 1
i think we ought to do, 1
the sun is shining life is, 1
castle that i ca n't catch, 1
the game for the rest of, 1
flight before we return to the, 1
a show those newborn twins who, 1
he threw one half into the, 1
another treasure do you promise to, 1
some triple fudge nut caramel ice, 1
do you wish to continue being, 1
it we can recharge them with, 1
can one skinny old furbob do, 1
you got ta lot of nerve, 1
n't you play by yourselves today, 1
that there are no plants or, 1
but does it matter to you, 1
just like the good old days, 1
furbobia and get the rest of, 1
this can as a free sample, 1
be able to admire my rare, 1
maybe i did let it go, 1
500 years to build the old, 1
gon na be the most famous, 1
i guess you were right honeysuckle, 1
his elevated eminence or is it, 1
boys caused so much trouble my, 1
to turn yellow into blue uh, 1
the tricks in my family okay, 1
have gotten careless and dropped it, 1
can you ever forgive me for, 1
why have you intruded on the, 1
you have a change of mind, 1
cracky it 's up to us, 1
've got to reach the gates, 1
've lost the rainbow of light, 1
stuff what are we going to, 1
i know it 's not my, 1
good cause i 'm gon na, 1
'll get a new claw and, 1
special talent for understanding her subjects, 1
go with you because we do, 1
and there 's nothing you can, 1
when they come we can be, 1
himself into this huge cloud of, 1
and guide the rest of you, 1
it is obvious that the metaphysical, 1
what is causing all the problems, 1
the rockdog to protect the gem, 1
tell me which way to go, 1
have made you famous and you, 1
think we 'd better be moving, 1
of here i could help the, 1
the ice is too thick for, 1
may will serve you well for, 1
you are go away go away, 1
how to be a grown up, 1
've found that replacement i was, 1
to believe me when i say, 1
is if you 're a witch, 1
traverse that overpass when we encounter, 1
shadows i need i will not, 1
sister dear do you plan to, 1
you 'll always be in hers, 1
have to find some other slaves, 1
stone statues all the way home, 1
there only one thing to do, 1
a perfect day so what 's, 1
you suppose it 's the way, 1
's time to ring in some, 1
'm camembert the mayor of muensterville, 1
pain when it comes to keeping, 1
i could get out of here, 1
got to make that stuff in, 1
and i ca n't see either, 1
bray we will reach ponyland very, 1
got ta find buttons i got, 1
peach blossom carry the bucket up, 1
of it a little dust would, 1
now being here is the right, 1
got to go where he ca, 1
more sunlight the sunstone will fade, 1
i looked in the mirror this, 1
logic clearly dictates that we save, 1
not something to be rushed gusty, 1
said if we go to the, 1
but what would dare to chase, 1
are we going to tell hydia, 1
why ice orgs and lava demons, 1
others have better luck than we, 1
it 's light will you hurry, 1
after all the ice-cream cones i, 1
you gon na do with us, 1
i think so if there 's, 1
okay these are the lists of, 1
we 'll have a better place, 1
when the sun sets flutter valley, 1
with those flutter ponies if it, 1
that i 'm stuck on my, 1
place for all folks near and, 1
what are you throwin' at me, 1
to the party faster than you, 1
darling you need n't even ask, 1
different song but i 'm not, 1
we wan na thaw things out, 1
not have a fourth pony a, 1
so that 's what 's going, 1
we 're going around in circles, 1
a touchdown till you pass the, 1
ugh tomorrow we have to play, 1
of you the little ponies almost, 1
i only tried to get the, 1
if we can get bray 's, 1
at last we 'll be together, 1
drog and he led us into, 1
one may take anything from a, 1
my father wishes to have these, 1
grand-daddies used to live in these, 1
about a giant bell but i, 1
right you have to do it, 1
you 've brought all that bad, 1
spell is broken that means my, 1
can make it hot enough to, 1
of furniture ready to fight us, 1
i wonder if squirk 's found, 1
the flutter ponies too do n't, 1
it with the tear that melted, 1
one hot bath we wo n't, 1
we 're trapped down here forever, 1
started when we lost the magic, 1
we take 'em to satin slipper, 1
come on you can be with, 1
off our wings we could fly, 1
do is make a wish and, 1
what else would you expect from, 1
i did n't want to sleep, 1
when i make it light up, 1
if by midnight i do not, 1
n't there anything we can do, 1
'm gon na flood the land, 1
heartthrob did use any of those, 1
two and they only got one, 1
but how can we get word, 1
i wonder where they came from, 1
if you 're finished we could, 1
speaking of friends where is gusty, 1
that put her to sleep in, 1
or if i can or if, 1
if it happens again you shall, 1
we could still find a good, 1
wo n't be listening to his, 1
should all go back to paradise, 1
trapped down here forever unless megan, 1
buttons you move the soup from, 1
if we had the sunstone it, 1
tricked me you miserable little ponies, 1
we ought to do something about, 1
catch the castle without any trouble, 1
that 's left to do is, 1
me how to use my fire, 1
look all i want is a, 1
hours you with the rest of, 1
of the wizard 's spell i, 1
too much of a good thing, 1
you to knock the frazzits into, 1
mess we 've gotten ourselves into, 1

it too with edgar 's help, 1
huge ruby in the crater of, 1
the name of his majesty king, 1

unicorns while there 's still time, 1

life through for you my sweet, 1
it would have been too much, 1
did you bring him back for, 1
there 's only one person who, 1
we ca n't squeeze through the, 1
sunstone back to flutter valley before, 1
there 's no time to save, 1
well yes i have they were, 1

which way leads to dream valley, 1
an awful witch who takes the, 1
as we know where these gizmonks, 1

horseshoes were made of mystical starlight, 1
i miss the sunset you 'll, 1
if being a dragon means being, 1
and show that furniture who 's, 1
you could n't have saved us, 1
of the city of the ancients, 1
the comforts of modern technology like, 1
and the baby ponies have been, 1
better use to you than me, 1
anything but the spell was n't, 1
you 've gone too far this, 1
i 've lost ribbon or is, 1
you to my father the king, 1
'm a dragon not a demon, 1
friendship is a wish come true, 1
take you prisoner in the name, 1
for pretending to be a ghost, 1
getting her youth from the other, 1
you that is tell you actually, 1
to be a grown up dragon, 1
's got ta be in here, 1
it 's exactly what i requested, 1
her with the kaleidostone while tattle, 1
megan there 's no point in, 1
happens to bushwoolies who want to, 1
even more magnificent than i thought, 1
to paradise estate and organize search, 1
i do n't see no coins, 1
he give everyone their shadows back, 1
right the baby ponies are missing, 1
in a position to make demands, 1

to lure grogar outside the city, 1
if it is n't one thing, 1
scorpan if by midnight i do, 1
all they do is snort dig, 1
place this never would have happened, 1
for once i 've got a, 1
i 'm not hiding it under, 1
did n't mean to get in, 1
and without glass how will i, 1
remember what happened the last time, 1
how are we gon na stop, 1
floating in a pond of her, 1
rapids in ponyland strong enough to, 1
is but a bad influence on, 1
we help you when you stand, 1
's really not so bad once, 1
careless and dropped it in the, 1
knew i did n't want to, 1
we better not wait any longer, 1
that 's okay baby you tried, 1
you find your way back to, 1
whoever you are but do you, 1
be a way to release the, 1
she 'll get right back to, 1
not our friend made us sick, 1
long before the water reaches here, 1
we 're gon na help him, 1
minutes you wo n't be able, 1
throb do n't you recognize us, 1
just hope the baby seaponies are, 1
it grandfather but i just do, 1
a very special talent for understanding, 1
now can you make a breeze, 1
even remember where home base is, 1
perhaps our new friends would like, 1
split is a terrific jumper and, 1
then your precious ponyland will never, 1
something weird 's going on here, 1
a kaleidostone then hand-me-down spotted her, 1
riddle i do n't know and, 1
if we keep an eye on, 1
said she 's thinking it over, 1
like us you think we 're, 1
you three do n't have any, 1
the genie of the lamp and, 1
's all settle down and go, 1
then let 's look for it, 1
the poor creature did n't have, 1
through that golden door that the, 1
but i ca n't seem to, 1
sweatband at the entrance to the, 1
that door and they 'll all, 1
did learn one thing from the, 1
and you have to find your, 1
all folks near and far so, 1
of the gate to the mountain, 1
paradise estate went haywire and then, 1
we can bring the wands to, 1
heard the one about never look, 1
's more serious here than i, 1
especially if they give us cupcakes, 1
to do with us or paradise, 1
have n't seen any of the, 1
minute megan i 'm coming with, 1
the finish line so get it, 1
flutter and get the flutter ponies, 1
do n't you run along for, 1
na start by stopping those little, 1
another dose of what i gave, 1
midnight is not far off megan, 1
no right now we all have, 1
and get into the valley that, 1
all seen the light so to, 1
have to lay our wands in, 1
's something dangerous behind that door, 1
if it a ghost it wo, 1
the setting sun and the end, 1
wind whistler is acting so silly, 1
out of the city you will, 1
idea that something would happen to, 1
ghost it wo n't get wet, 1
well it could be more dangerous, 1
are hard to come by around, 1
i 'll destroy him with chopped, 1
sorry i was you know jumping, 1
help us find them and and, 1
do n't you worry lil' fella, 1
may be small but when magnified, 1
so when they come we can, 1
happy that the toot-sweet little ponies, 1
i just knew they 'd escape, 1
squirk and crank in 'em just, 1
live up to it too with, 1
charming or paul bunyan can keep, 1
purple mountains you ca n't miss, 1
and the other half into what, 1
wan na know it started when, 1
you have your cerulean blue your, 1
but maybe i could have helped, 1
i can make bubbles that are, 1
can get ourselves out of this, 1
they do n't want to leave, 1
know how he does that-it 's, 1
wo n't be much to look, 1
soup from the bucket into the, 1
give up grogar we 've got, 1
why do n't you talk to, 1
yourself only good things will happen, 1
huh we 've got to rescue, 1
we have to get to flutter, 1
i 've got better things to, 1
have to do is make a, 1
us to dream valley and you, 1
it means everything is all right, 1
changes slowly from the realm of, 1
and i 'll remember all of, 1
sure we 're doing the right, 1
'd kick me out of the, 1
we 'd better go see what, 1
'll find it do n't worry, 1
'm going to the costume ball, 1
gizmonks that i 'll get back, 1
where did you think you were, 1
nearly all the little ponies and, 1
first showed the future " the, 1
this is not t-t-tasty good food, 1
we wo n't have a home, 1
and ze guards are after zem, 1
now buttons you move the soup, 1
special will be coming over at, 1
find them and and turn them, 1
here soon we can kiss flutter, 1
'll figure out how to rescue, 1
ought a watch where you 're, 1
megan lives on the other side, 1
you have some rope in that, 1
well i guess you 'll be, 1
this time the rest of you, 1
legend says there are challenges to, 1
i think it 's more than, 1
and i 've no intention of, 1
then we 'll just go talk, 1
of paradise estate did n't really, 1
have n't begun to be sorry, 1
as i said everything is back, 1
well they all left the land, 1
these banners and bows and balloons, 1
see how you like it when, 1
your fire breathing powers get stronger, 1
'll never return and i wo, 1
of you to catch at once, 1
an outward sign of some loss, 1
do n't think i 'm going, 1
jump out and surprise us now, 1
all the shadows i need i, 1
could be more dangerous down there, 1
my mind how to be one, 1
n't take any to the baby, 1
which one is the real cloak, 1
is there a wall of briars, 1
've never seen a storm clear, 1
eminence or is it his royal, 1
sonny sonny are you in here, 1
you 'll be one of the, 1
can get me all the shadows, 1
i will keep this last one, 1
dumb guards stop us from savin', 1
will you fly with me and, 1
i do n't have the right, 1
you can have gingerbread cookies and, 1
become the most powerful creature in, 1
of flesh are alive just like, 1
do have to check with the, 1
not gon na get away with, 1
how 'd you get up there, 1
we at least get moving while, 1
'll know her when you see, 1
to get any bigger cupcake but, 1
are the lists of items to, 1
paradise estate and check the library, 1
and he might tell us things, 1
ball would be like to play, 1
by this machine it creates a, 1
the legend of the four golden, 1
go back to furbobia and get, 1
to do with my time than, 1
and then your precious ponyland will, 1
we better split up and try, 1
rockdog turned bushwoolies-turned bushwoolies- to stone, 1
one step closer and i 'll, 1
know that the sunstone is burning, 1
how much better you can do, 1
at we 'd never try to, 1
a teensy bit guilty about what, 1
mean that i 'd never have, 1
of you come with me to, 1
lickety-split and knight shade and try, 1
really sorry but i think you, 1
got a lot of nerve coming, 1
'll never get away with this, 1
grundle ran fast but the giant, 1
and what about the barometric pressure, 1
noise or the guard will come, 1
and i 'm all out of, 1
their precious sunstone and the bees, 1
n't think we should count on, 1
estate collapsed but no one was, 1
make me do what he wants, 1
my poor poor darlings and the, 1
i guess i never really realized, 1
me up is a nice big, 1
and i do not believe my, 1
back before sunset or flutter valley, 1
a floating castle that i ca, 1
to look in the book of, 1
do i. the bushwoolies have stopped, 1
present princess tiffany one of the, 1
can do without the other half, 1
i 've never seen anything like, 1
long way back to paradise estate, 1
come on get to work move, 1
this is how she treats innocent, 1
it 's too hot to handle, 1
will be wilted and ugly and, 1
since they used all our hair, 1
not that your looks are n't, 1
you probably do know the way, 1
place the little ponies told us, 1
the flutter ponies and the sunstone, 1
to make him indestructible i had, 1
're gon na be fixing things, 1
of ponyland in the dungeons by, 1
her forever to bake that cake, 1
to do magic is n't the, 1
to get them outta here now, 1
ever get out of here by, 1
are going to rescue megan and, 1
was singing erebus had zeb steal, 1
but we ca n't reach the, 1
the selection of their best food, 1
after that they 'll let us, 1
um actually well she thought it, 1
you do n't want to drown, 1
how we do the dance of, 1
wash our claws of this whole, 1

me and a couple pals were, 1
that 's beyond the jewel desert, 1

to use the wand 's magic, 1
kingdom of the lava demons and, 1
before they rip up all of, 1
hoo hoo hoo my name 's, 1
my friend so you can abuse, 1
and with great courage he took, 1
it 's the source from which, 1
on let 's go to paradise, 1
is sick and we think it, 1
north star where are the scree, 1
i wonder where the baby ponies, 1
have a perfect treasure for youe, 1
bring flutter valley back to life, 1
a spell that put her to, 1
just is n't a game for, 1
how i could predict north star, 1
get a chance to do something, 1
never thought they 'd act like, 1
we 've been walking and walking, 1
i ever glad to see you, 1
na get a ball to play, 1
a new claw and fix the, 1
winter coming soon and her being, 1
one of the legendary princess ponies, 1
care what you do with her, 1
i know it was here yesterday, 1
sunstone will fade forever it 's, 1
'till i get out of here, 1
not much time to find the, 1
against grogar and you 'll be, 1
should lead right to the palace, 1
own cookie and your future is, 1
can have unforeseen and hazardous side, 1
somnambula 's been getting her youth, 1
this point i fear our only, 1
valley the wind left her at, 1
here i could help the other, 1
only wink out through empty space, 1
are you gon na do baby, 1
it looked like something was chasing, 1
well you can try it if, 1
inventors of the one and only, 1
star and spike they seem to, 1
luck that may will serve you, 1
quacker why are you going to, 1
we 're going to find them, 1
wha-what are we going to tell, 1
i became famous more fans came, 1
'll have you outta there in, 1
i was trying to slay him, 1
i wo n't be able to, 1
spare me the wisdom of your, 1
he wants megan to look in, 1
're here to help you escape, 1
one has ever been this kind, 1
you must take it and stop, 1
thinking came through when we needed, 1
only one who 'd live around, 1
saved our dell and the entire, 1
these monsters are just plants right, 1
order a hole to be dug, 1
touches will be transformed into something, 1
being the monster anymore than prince, 1
high time we went back to, 1
beautiful trees are barren and covered, 1
better than a sense of accomplishment, 1
is our duty to protect the, 1
me not feel good 'bout hoping, 1
it was too hot for anyone, 1
guess it 's better than just, 1
know where the other half of, 1
paper with the recipe disappears and, 1
n't you be better off tryin', 1
coated and her throat is n't, 1
really need to know where he, 1
need more slaves with hands bray, 1
'll bet everybody thinks i 'm, 1
wan na rule the world and, 1
upset the magical powers of ponyland, 1
i 'd like to speak to, 1
of honour we want you to, 1
is right you 'll find the, 1
maybe we can blow down these, 1
does n't mean it 's safe, 1
i think that old troll would, 1
any heart into crunch himself accidentally, 1

time you 'll know that we, 1
's go to bumbleland and free, 1
will serve you well for you, 1

better things to do with my, 1
maybe if we can bring the, 1
see if i can find her, 1
it 'll reach dream valley soon, 1
we 'll get it fixed somehow, 1
on we take 'em to satin, 1
put out the salamander 's flame, 1
there 'll be nothing left but, 1
now if we can just get, 1
could anything dangerous be behind such, 1
have lost their shadows and we, 1
there 's no point in talking, 1
change of mind and believe your, 1
nag does n't know what to, 1
know a way to do that, 1
and now i must be going, 1
i 'm no good at anything, 1

others here in hopes that we, 1
cuddles will be as good as, 1
you put them out of it, 1
off to slay a dragon and, 1
do n't trust me trust megan, 1

flutter valley and grow all the, 1
when the feelings fairy was passing, 1
you are cordially invited to a, 1
would cheer me up is a, 1
'll probably find the source of, 1
n't have any musical talents yourselves, 1
we would have done something about, 1
back in ponyland will be happy, 1
if only i had n't been, 1
i made you what you are, 1

he must be one of the, 1
my old friend and set things, 1
i 'm spike and this is, 1
n't wink through the wall so--i, 1
enjoy the comforts of modern technology, 1
course if ya can forgive me, 1
you can do it morning glory, 1
one thing is necessary flutter ponies, 1

go to dream valley and tell, 1
back in there and show that, 1
and i ca n't fly much, 1
i 've been terribly worried ever, 1
and we will be too unless, 1
of the campgrounds before we move, 1
aha oh i 'm impressed with, 1
i wish we could go with, 1
if anyone can go that high, 1
belongs to niblick only he can, 1
we 'd better do something they, 1
the place where we saw him, 1
're gon na have our own, 1
guess what i 'm gon na, 1
think i 'd better keep an, 1
looks like pony hair once it, 1
helped them escape or i could, 1
i 'd just like to say, 1
it in a crack than eat, 1
everyone-come out and have a look, 1
what what happened to the red, 1
the other half into what came, 1
loss of their shadows being an, 1
he 'll fold up like an, 1
babies ' shadows were in the, 1
second had the power of blazing, 1
what does all this have to, 1
notice that whenever grogar used his, 1
to think that that that you, 1
think you should know that the, 1
in the dark for all eternity, 1
under ahhg and get into the, 1
maybe we 'd better look for, 1
so when i 'm too old, 1
we 've got to get to, 1
if you send it close enough, 1
a wonderful thought to be a, 1
all little ponies we know you, 1
and all the bees are gone, 1
go he did n't really wan, 1
never been very good at polo, 1
we ask it to go away, 1

valentine 's friend gallop away at, 1

do n't the stonebacks like you, 1
now you realize that you 've, 1

and i will get to work, 1
let 's work to beat those, 1

would n't you be better off, 1
to lay our wands in the, 1

do n't want to go with, 1
could jump out and surprise us, 1
on little one you can do, 1
oh there must be something we, 1
" and as he chased he, 1
and stay away from that door, 1
every room has a different surprise, 1
it 's not worth it any, 1
after us. to hunt us down, 1
to rescue megan and the rest, 1

as soon as i put on, 1
could n't know the water would, 1
yeah that 's it wind whistler, 1

we wo n't hear another word, 1
flick of my magic wand i, 1
reconnoiter and ascertain what 's transpiring, 1
babies ' back their shadows or, 1
you have n't begun to be, 1
where 's my ice cream cone, 1
with no feelings could remain calm, 1
see my magic is running low, 1
wink through walls and that door, 1
to do is find this eminence, 1
that was the best landing we, 1
made me take my act on, 1
the horseshoe but what can we, 1
these frazzits must go back into, 1
he turns into a permanent grump, 1
stand on that side of the, 1
right in ponyland again and lavan, 1
for polish made from glitter scent, 1
and finding a way to make, 1
me one i do n't know, 1
the world would be a fearful, 1
this is the place where we, 1
ice cream without toppings me old, 1
much to look at when we, 1
no ooh no- no that way, 1
got to set your mind to, 1
if i can make it back, 1
honey off our wings we could, 1
thinks i 'm useless and they, 1
your children could be happening to, 1
the castle 's starting to fall, 1
what 's so important that you, 1
think they 're dangerous do you, 1
'll never be ready for the, 1
've moved so many times in, 1
you see i needed a guard, 1
had put a piece of black, 1
of those multi-colored dingbags is smarter, 1
even make up my mind how, 1
tape we can use it to, 1
do n't know how he does, 1
for you and tried to help, 1
how 're we ever gon na, 1
guess this 'll teach ya who, 1
are ruining the ecology of this, 1
do a good deed with just, 1
comes to keeping things neat but, 1
i would n't be surprised if, 1
but i do n't know what, 1
ask you about some new legends, 1
know what any of these symbols, 1
to get hurt no matter where, 1
you do that to the rest, 1
and then grogar immobilized them all, 1
i was just mopped an hour, 1
and we 'll have a new, 1
how about a week off every, 1
you stay here in case they, 1
it 's landing she 's not, 1
you have to come and get, 1
magic cloak and exchange it for, 1
sonny where can i take you, 1
you believe it 'll happen and, 1
sound of ya all not playin', 1
find water to put them in, 1
you 're playing hide and seek, 1

it a ghost it wo n't, 1
creates a wind so cold that, 1
n't go nowhere 'til i change, 1
when we get home eh slugger, 1
attitude so now nothing bad will, 1
have to leave ya but they, 1
you know the way and then, 1
a simple explanation for this seemingly, 1
he 's completely blown our cover, 1
get confused once in a while, 1
keeping things neat but he well, 1
knows why it 's so c-c-cold, 1
on cherries jubilee you can do, 1
wink in and out instantly megan, 1
along with the rest of you, 1
and and that 's my pony, 1
little ponies and not the babies, 1
on get to work move it, 1
do is walk through that door, 1
does n't look like we 'll, 1
ever be able to rescue megan, 1
the clumsy that you seem to, 1
me have craving for nice salad, 1
used his magic the bell around, 1
remembered as the flutter pony who, 1
take my act on the road, 1
and bray if it happens again, 1
the only two flutter ponies that, 1
just wanted to tell you to, 1
we do it all the time, 1
how to drain the magic in, 1
to force your friends to bring, 1
would return in 500 years to, 1
when i was just a lad, 1
long it is refreshing to find, 1
it ooh- ooh no no no, 1
if she was a big ol', 1
and spike they seem to intuit, 1
how could anything dangerous be behind, 1
damage but you you went and, 1
can only wink out through empty, 1
i fear our only recourse is, 1
is getting rid of me a, 1
wake up you can have gingerbread, 1
bushwoolies remember now this is it, 1
if ya know what 's good, 1
hurry fizzy before squirk and crank, 1
on the road and he sent, 1
into the dell we uh we, 1
will you give it to us, 1
we found out he 's ticklish, 1
and i 'll get the idol, 1
knight shade there 's no way, 1
for you i might have given, 1
ask but what are you going, 1
i do n't know about that, 1
the work of replacing my magical, 1
a wonderful red ball that can, 1
'd never have any hope of, 1
a guard to protect the heartstone, 1
sent zeb along to do the, 1
you like to do things differently, 1
cream flavor double banana marshmallow colada, 1
enough perhaps we can retrieve the, 1
huguenot the bravest knight of all, 1
you guys have some really awesome, 1
you suppose these huge oak trees, 1
guarantee anything this paint touches will, 1
will be banished to the realm, 1
it any time i needed them, 1
must be nearing the third one, 1
there may be other beings who, 1
those two out of the water, 1
's the most beautiful place in, 1
baby ponies are safe with the, 1
of his majesty king charlatan the, 1
okay i 've spliced the tape, 1
the only thing that can help, 1
count to twenty and then come, 1
clean through the wash with them, 1
i 'd better reinforce the whole, 1
galaxy heart throb and i will, 1
made us even more exhausted ugh, 1
have a feeling that huge bell, 1
pony friend are going to be, 1
out of the estate by uninvited, 1
pay for what you did to, 1
's made of green cheese and, 1
you the little ponies almost escaped, 1
lives far away in the dangerous, 1
my whole life through for you, 1
two out of the water long, 1
the big brothers do n't make, 1
stay here with lickety-split and knight, 1
magic i wo n't be able, 1
the frazzits remain in the barrel, 1
we 'll never be ready for, 1
well that 's a definite problem, 1
niblick 's even crankier than most, 1
show us the way to grayvale, 1
do n't you remember what happened, 1
it 's more serious here than, 1
niblick 's house is not far, 1
're sure to get at least, 1
he 's such a nice guy, 1
perhaps it 's the horseshoes they, 1
do n't hear the tinkle of, 1
say you 're gon na be, 1
see it 's just so hard, 1
the dangers of the floating castle, 1
but what if there 's no, 1
that means you did n't betray, 1
i need some magical material to, 1
i think i 'll just see, 1
we 'll fight it as long, 1
you go and no more complaints, 1
it last appeared 500 years ago, 1
you can come back to paradise, 1
you promise to leave us alone, 1
a surprise i do n't like, 1
most powerful magic in the world, 1
you and the rest of the, 1
good for you but guess what, 1
ponies just so you can let, 1
that is of any use to, 1
'd better get this back to, 1
bad that i lost the rainbow, 1
by midnight my chariot does not, 1
i remember the little ponies telling, 1
still want to turn the other, 1
the sunstone we wo n't have, 1
may i present princess tiffany one, 1
form search parties and try to, 1
not until we get the sunstone, 1
we 'll probably never let you, 1
according to the ancient legend tambelon, 1
've done everything a mother could, 1
unless megan and the others manage, 1
will suffer along with the rest, 1
megan the flories were so pretty, 1
dream valley and you 'll be, 1
you 're now all expert winkers, 1
why should i crawl to him, 1
to fly gracefully through the sky, 1
no wonder all the magic in, 1
some kind of creature in there, 1
too close if you ask me, 1
friend gallop away into the darkening, 1
into the crack and make it, 1
something pointer do you see anything, 1
these here ponies possess magical properties, 1
my friends are just gon na, 1
dragon camp is all very well, 1
how much trouble can she be, 1
girls ought a watch where you, 1
we 're out of ice cream, 1
chowed down the way we did, 1
it 's the big brothers ya, 1
i bet you 're surprised to, 1
before i pull you under with, 1
the other ponies and her new, 1
's too bad you were n't, 1
i could sing a different song, 1
big ice-cream cone and i mean, 1
i ca n't even make up, 1
you about some new legends i, 1
be extra help for everyone in, 1
were staying behind with the others, 1
but wishing on them can get, 1
but these ponies here these living, 1
grundles looked all over i mean, 1
it all started when everything in, 1
we must prepare a plan for, 1
help my friends they need you, 1
grogar we 've got you surrounded, 1
do you suppose these huge oak, 1
the black mountains the black mountains, 1
i 'll wink up there and, 1
long i guess we do n't, 1
done right you have to do, 1
put it between these jaws to, 1
drank so much nectar i 'm, 1
a good deed to become a, 1
i heard my dad do it, 1
think we 're in big trouble, 1
mayor you must let us go, 1
gives crunch the power to turn, 1
but i discovered my mistake too, 1
is simply death to my complexion, 1

how we get out of here, 1
need it for mimic 's sake, 1
my son and his friends alone, 1
with you because we do n't, 1
restoring grayvale and my mother to, 1
brothers like they walking in sleep, 1
our grand-daddies used to live in, 1
build forts and have a snowball, 1
go way to go way to, 1
ponies to learn how to use, 1
if these things are guarding the, 1

wishes to have these creatures transferred, 1

that you seem to think you, 1
be concerned about how i looked, 1
wind whistler she looks so embarrassed, 1
thought we had to stop them, 1
right dinah 's a baby and, 1
is find the other half of, 1
should have to face the flories, 1
what 's the matter with him, 1
you pay for what you did, 1
it 's a matter of thinking, 1
maybe if you believe in yourself, 1
maybe you 'll even be you, 1
a third foot when they grow, 1
did n't push that old witch, 1
i just did what she told, 1
to knock the frazzits into the, 1
got ta find that peddler and, 1
ways flowers are hard to come, 1
you might be interested in a, 1
what might have happened to them, 1
blossom carry the bucket up to, 1
i hate to do this but, 1
have a feeling we 're gon, 1
too small to pull my chariot, 1
you know i forgot just how, 1
she hates me she hates me, 1
you 're not a lava demon, 1
's here you 'll find out, 1
the stuff in this pile megan, 1
're already late for the celebration, 1
but what good would it do, 1
i hope we do n't miss, 1
problem is getting through that door, 1
covert surveillance and report back posthaste, 1
you do n't like us you, 1
it all started when we lost, 1
now galaxy you come with us, 1
i think they 'll be back, 1
but you got ta give me, 1
get the sunstone and go back, 1
on them we 'd be the, 1
want to stumble round in the, 1
're not the bravest just because, 1
that was a close call rosedust, 1
duty to protect the magic wands, 1
pa most would be if you, 1
come from one of your own, 1
appreciate the beauty in things which, 1
that would cheer me up is, 1
to let you turn on me, 1
you had it in you all, 1
guard to protect the heartstone which, 1
mean it 's a matter of, 1
was saying i got rose fever, 1
did n't fall in the water, 1
now baby lickety-split it wo n't, 1
well you 've got it pointer, 1
anyone to say a word against, 1
we 've got ta get these, 1
do what bumble tells me to, 1
for certain that they 're in, 1
friends are--so what are you doin', 1
dwellers the forest might not have, 1
may be ponyland 's only hope, 1
stuck and the only guy who, 1
so long i guess we do, 1
that 's not it at all, 1
n't even make it through a, 1
not accomplishing anything waiting for it, 1
a ping-pong table made especially for, 1
gon na come looking for us, 1
're gon na play this when, 1
be there as soon as i, 1
n't fly fast enough or high, 1
crab nasties know how to handle, 1
we could really learn a lot, 1
'll even be you know a, 1
you get to know her better, 1
you 've caused enough trouble with, 1
the sunstone must be retrieved or, 1
able to rescue megan and the, 1
we hide and you go seek, 1
besides i 've always wanted an, 1
i 'm trying to help my, 1
of visions where is the horseshoe, 1
mind and believe your deeds both, 1
darkness that darkness sends now begin, 1
troggles that anyone not found celebrating, 1
n't listen they do n't think, 1
now there will be no more, 1
of course i also still think, 1
and used up his energy the, 1
to get them master honest i, 1
a 200-foot sugar cone filled with, 1
but i ca n't remember exactly, 1
wanted in return was a little, 1
's and the rest of grayvale, 1
the dangerous crimson canyon that 's, 1
we go under the ocean for, 1
magical amulet the flashstone to punish, 1
the sunstone back where it belongs, 1
i mean all bees can fly, 1
what if he does n't see, 1
do to stop this from happening, 1
frozen over all who are unworthy, 1
i 'd bring you right back, 1
to drop the nets on 'em, 1
n't have any magical powers like, 1
fun to fly gracefully through the, 1
see what this is all about, 1
laws no one may take anything, 1
n't be listening to his nonsense, 1
we 'll have to go ask, 1
the evil be gone the good, 1
i ca n't take it anymore, 1
it looks to me like the, 1
let 's fix these crabies once, 1
the realm of darkness a sort, 1
the metaphysical power of these coins, 1
my place to ask but what, 1
distinct feeling we 're being followed, 1
that 's where we 've got, 1
's also too bad that i, 1
well spike you 're getting to, 1
just like you 'll always be, 1
tracks all day without a sign, 1
you concentrate on flying wind whistler, 1
get newborn twins some place safe, 1
where have you been all my, 1
i do n't suhelp you could, 1
place in ponyland where you 'll, 1
bees to steal the sunstone from, 1
shoop-shoop-bee-doo shoo-bee-doo shoop-shoop-bee-doo i glad molly, 1
a good deed is a quitter, 1
we 've seen why you want, 1
the magic wands once we have, 1
to rescue the princess ponies from, 1
kind of huge bird i think, 1
best way to find out is, 1
there 's nothing to do but, 1
or it 's snip-snip for you, 1
the troggles that anyone not found, 1
escape and make their way back, 1
're not nearly as charming as, 1
one and it was for such, 1
i only do what i have, 1
but it will become so ugly, 1
to be held here until they, 1
yeah we do n't want to, 1
what 's happened to my friends, 1
maybe i can move it with, 1
you 're gon na be nice, 1
i think we 'd better rest, 1
all right an evil and nasty, 1
you 're not thinking of this, 1
police and they are escaped convicts, 1
'll have a new place to, 1
got to form search parties and, 1
when magnified by this machine it, 1
not enough of us to carry, 1
this is end of your quest, 1
of my plan to help you, 1
and we think they 're headed, 1
more where that came from if, 1
'd better take her with us, 1
to give up then erebus came, 1
this time get his friend who, 1
and after everything you 've done, 1
there you will find another horseshoe, 1
have a power of our own, 1
i 'm the only one that, 1
i want to check this place, 1
i wan na cross the water, 1
a way to release the magic, 1
's can be used for evil, 1
friends of yours arrived ze first, 1
had the sunstone it would attract, 1
as rosedust queen of the flutter, 1
n't swing my axe to save, 1
i know just how to handle, 1

here just a little while ago, 1
what about bumble and her bees, 1
catrina and whatever you do do, 1
lookin' forward to seein' them little, 1
a simple matter of potential energy, 1
me for pretending to be a, 1
place is full of bad luck, 1
now we all have to work, 1
he should n't have tried to, 1
's underneath and--what 's happening to, 1
is gon na be so proud, 1
well they could n't mean us, 1
ca n't take any to the, 1
she 'll help mimic get well, 1
pony needs horseshoe more than mave, 1

the moochick and the baby ponies, 1
we wan na talk to ya, 1
'll have to trust you drog, 1
're free there 's still a, 1
recall an ancient legend about that, 1

but i believe i can expedite, 1
where we 'll probably find the, 1
promise me we 'll be together, 1
she 's there waiting to be, 1
i do n't care what you, 1
okay do n't have a fit, 1
ca n't accompany you but i, 1
just until she creates a new, 1

rails at the finish line score, 1
what are ya gon na do, 1
and your names will be mentioned, 1
power to give it to you, 1
grogar this is your last chance, 1
fourth let its wearer float like, 1
we have captured two of the, 1
is walk through that door and, 1
's watching us in the viewing, 1
're looking for a magic horseshoe, 1
i thought that big aligatorwhatsit did, 1
brought you here if you were, 1
moochick and finding a way to, 1
be surprised if your fire breathing, 1
small but when magnified by this, 1
's right not only is he, 1
a test to prove you 're, 1
boys what are you doing here, 1
you just stay with us understand, 1
that 's the 306th time i, 1
of yours arrived ze first tooth, 1
keep your eye on the ball, 1
friend who thinks she 's been, 1
trapped where they ca n't give, 1
the thing we saw in the, 1
somebody 's got to sneak into, 1
and we have so much fun, 1
bravery quick thinking came through when, 1
it wo n't hurt will it, 1
so what 's so important that, 1
there 's fresh air coming through, 1
should warn you grogar plans to, 1
world would be a fearful place, 1
we 've got ta get to, 1
are you sure we 're doing, 1
their friends have been captured master, 1
away they 'll never find it, 1
a couple more clouds and we, 1
n't actually believe that bad luck, 1
impatient to run back here for, 1
but we inadvertently released them and, 1
how do we get the heart, 1
while i was singing erebus had, 1
anyway it 's just as well, 1
we sent it over the hill, 1
yeah i wanted to learn how, 1
wait a second i do n't, 1
do we get the heart of, 1
once in a while and only, 1
hooves up out of the dirt, 1
i could do something to save, 1
oh we simply must help him, 1
we 've been following the ponies, 1
did n't backfire on us this, 1
be said for a well-organized library, 1
enough for you to eat it, 1
that leg of yours will be, 1
' back their shadows or else, 1
up because you are my prisoners, 1
now while you hunt for the, 1
and baby ribbon they 'd be, 1
'll never see my grandfather again, 1
the man who is in love, 1
i just do n't know who, 1
na do let 's snap it, 1
how she treats innocent defenseless babies, 1
will perform a covert surveillance and, 1
if squirk 's found the flashstone, 1
we do n't want to know, 1
will happen when the heartstone is, 1
feared an all-out ice cream war, 1
we 'll have a new place, 1
bad things can turn out good, 1
sing better than baby heart throb, 1
anywhere in ponyland either and we, 1
in the mirror this morning darling, 1
this are always happening to me, 1
those newborn twins who 's boss, 1

it 's paradise and wind whistler, 1
of the flutter ponies and the, 1
back with somethin' i like and, 1
he just got me mad that, 1

and so using his powerful flashstone, 1
n't any of the secret tunnels, 1
on you can be with me, 1

but where are megan and north, 1
the only thing that can restore, 1
out of here i could help, 1

your magic horseshoe is needed to, 1
now and what i say is, 1

you ca n't fool me anymore, 1
keep an eye on them we, 1
tunnels in here that even lavan, 1

perfect day so what 's so, 1
legend of the princess ponies and, 1
there 's nothing to protect you, 1
is tell you actually that well, 1
very hard to give it up, 1
a sorcerer forged the golden door, 1

danny is feeling a little rambunctious, 1
we can go there if you, 1
n't around when the feelings fairy, 1
ice orgs and lava demons have, 1
huge bell we found in that, 1
i 'm gon na teach you, 1
that will banish the ponies from, 1
it is our duty to protect, 1
we 've tried everything and i, 1
be plagued no more the evil, 1
long before you ponies lived here, 1
've got ta get some more, 1

little friends back in ponyland will, 1
him a lesson he 'll nay, 1

are n't you going to change, 1
matters is that he 's hurt, 1

some word on the flutter ponies, 1
into the city and rescue everyone, 1

there was food stacked as high, 1
marshmallow maniac i 'll stop you, 1
back into the realm of darkness, 1

of sunlight and the sunstone will, 1
if we would have done something, 1

we 'll lead you to the, 1
suppose these huge oak trees come, 1

let 's go find the others, 1
grateful we are you can have, 1
the gruel into the crack and, 1
hate to do this but let'em, 1

get some grub i 'm starvin', 1
get word to the rest of, 1
thing we saw in the mirror, 1

us the legend of the princess, 1
get out of this dreadful place, 1
whole place is getting so pushy, 1
i did n't know then that, 1
to leave his one true love, 1
this could be the golden door, 1
i 'm on a witch watch, 1
nice big ice-cream cone and i, 1
beezen 's probably got every scrap, 1
needs us to take care of, 1
you are not all merry men, 1

make a bubble but what good, 1
no no power is needed day, 1
matter of seconds it will be, 1
go away you 're spoiling my, 1
some of us want to see, 1
we thought we heard a crash, 1
the moochick and finding a way, 1
on the right track after all, 1
mass and being converted into kinetic, 1
little friends but you ca n't, 1
i think i just made a, 1
we better get out of here, 1
whether we want to or not, 1
be the source of his magic, 1
i think you 'd better wake, 1

evil and mean give me something, 1
and follow their trail while it, 1
's more to them than there, 1

legend it 's the source from, 1
another fine mess we 've gotten, 1
has been put right in ponyland, 1
got flutter valley and we got, 1
question like that at a time, 1
well i guess everything will be, 1
roiling depths of the volcano of, 1
dig it up because you are, 1
i sent them home to their, 1
we ask the flutter ponies to, 1
're gon na throw things at, 1
one and only steam-powered multi-tasking double-ant, 1
they want to be friends but, 1
bit guilty about what happened to, 1
like 40 miles of bad road, 1
princess that all this belongs to, 1
my people are fed up with, 1
telling us the legend of the, 1
really did n't mean to get, 1
passed through his village and demolished, 1
for we must prepare a plan, 1
what if they have the sunstone, 1
and try to get them from, 1
's too bad we ca n't, 1
thing that bag of flubber porcina, 1
kitchen bake to your heart 's, 1
's been so long since we, 1
time to get the sunstone in, 1
to help us help the furbobs, 1
you be willing to undergo a, 1
our magic wands there they are, 1
packing to g-g-go south for the, 1
father 's throne room is right, 1
of us could just escape and, 1
i 'll pick all the coins, 1
lasted long enough for you to, 1
it 's around here somewhere i, 1
megan if you can still get, 1
oh sonny where can i take, 1
estate and i 'll show you, 1
the sunstone is starting to work, 1
that ought a hold this little, 1
being only a puppy i guess, 1
duchess can have your old job, 1
'll have to talk to the, 1
was too hot for anyone to, 1
we can try to run again, 1
are too many just to grab, 1
this is not a job for, 1
afraid of that they all have, 1
that the big bell we found, 1
but would your mirrored world not, 1
enchanted slumber in a floating castle, 1
stop lavan you need your magic, 1
should n't make fun of you, 1
maybe they found a way to, 1
better day for playing polo can, 1
when it strikes we shall all, 1
let go before i pull you, 1
he lives in the mushromp over, 1
only way we 'll ever get, 1
's spell is broken that means, 1
the symbol engraved on each coin, 1
really not so bad once you, 1
to flutter valley by sunset flutter, 1
and gizmos and hyper super-duper technical, 1
do n't think they have no, 1
the bubble is so big it, 1
magnifier and get him to reverse, 1
a couple pals were kickin' around, 1
i 'll stop you if it, 1
somethin' better than my magic coins, 1
surely your whole life has n't, 1
have to use one of the, 1
for one as fair as you, 1
tunnel under ahhg and get into, 1
the worst special signal i ever, 1
everyone can enjoy the comforts of, 1
for the hand of ariel that, 1
perhaps the bell is the repository, 1
start by stopping those little ponies, 1
wink through stuff like this net, 1
newborn twins get all the attention, 1
port and set sail for safe, 1
the day i 'm ready to, 1
those four-legged suckers the long claws, 1
only now me not feel good, 1
congratulate my friend woebegone and you, 1
good luck looking for your parents, 1
how do we get past ahhg, 1
only we had more help we, 1
n't be out after dark alone, 1
to protect you but you would, 1
other day i wanted some triple, 1
that they all have come to, 1
would get the sunstone and the, 1
n't want any more arguing you, 1
she 'll think you 're the, 1
and look who 's with her, 1
you can do that others ca, 1
twins get to go and we, 1
stop it or i 'll bite, 1
worry about a thing baby cuddles, 1
you tricked me you miserable little, 1
and then i 'm gon na, 1
'm not half so good as, 1
part of a carefully conceived plan, 1
it is you 're doing stop, 1
have you ever seen anything so, 1
should have lasted long enough for, 1
you are heroes and i 'm, 1
rocks look like they might give, 1
just like a couple of fish, 1
horseshoe to save your friend correct, 1
you crumbled your own cookie and, 1
do n't like danger n-n-no sir, 1
this place there 's nothing to, 1
rule the world and even if, 1
they 're the army that can, 1
so that 's where we 'll, 1
ordered me to mop you again, 1
they use a cane for a, 1
then their power will be restored, 1
and these are my eh huh, 1
we can start picking the cherries, 1
i do n't deserve your cheers, 1
're lookin' forward to seein' them, 1
get a new claw and fix, 1
just like that giant bear in, 1
with somethin' i like and we, 1
i just do n't have any, 1
protect you but you would n't, 1
her magic is all in her, 1
and bray do n't dawdle mmm, 1

you 're gon na miss more, 1
i thought you might like this, 1

stones danny likes to skip on, 1

yeah yeah but he tried to, 1
perfection is not something to be, 1
that crunch now has a heart, 1

thing powerful enough to defeat him, 1
was n't exactly what i had, 1
you should have stuck with me, 1
power of his magical amulet the, 1
would your mirrored world not take, 1
'em in my good luck collection, 1
your names will be mentioned prominently, 1
takes more than just knowledge to, 1
the perfect setting to raise a, 1
who 's asked to see you, 1
the home of the green mountain, 1

yeah 'cause they will be turned, 1
that is not what i was, 1
thing that might help defeat tirrac, 1
" what good would that do, 1
me about about your true love, 1
i have the perfect place for, 1
very special talent for understanding her, 1
it 's all right all right, 1
you now she kinda grows on, 1
think of all the things you, 1
but she--she has to live with, 1
ribbon means is that you 're, 1
practice if you 're going to, 1
bit since the start of this, 1
us food and keep it coming, 1
oh books are one thing but, 1
sheriff ricotta and i will go, 1
screes only bet on sure things, 1
megan may i present princess tiffany, 1
all my senses have been sharpened, 1
better since they used all our, 1
thing i ca n't do right, 1
spell that put her to sleep, 1
come on little one you can, 1
get past our nasty cousins the, 1
want to see him defeated as, 1
going to be held here until, 1
have to find water for the, 1
but nobody came to see me, 1
we should bring her a present, 1
'd all better take a nap, 1
's still honey on our wings, 1
others can make it it 's, 1
not my place to ask but, 1
's not gon na get away, 1
but we 've still got to, 1
and she threatened to turn ponyland, 1
can you change shape and get, 1
's because they left the land, 1
i just do n't know how, 1
why all the little ponies left, 1
we can get bray 's voice, 1
it was warm a second ago, 1
zeb steal everyone 's shadow including, 1
long to return to my workshop, 1
never learn how to be a, 1
monster anymore than prince charming can, 1
it even created that little black, 1
a lovely day for exploring eh, 1
us can sneak in where a, 1
and now you 're stinking mean, 1
her and was she ever mad, 1
stop squirk from turning ponyland into, 1
'm really sorry but i think, 1
would you be willing to undergo, 1
'm sure i have something about, 1
unicorns just disappear and re-appear outside, 1
my little cutie everywhere we look, 1
it 's certainly is nice to, 1
was for such a good cause, 1
inventors of gadgets and gizmos and, 1
you famous and you could have, 1
ever fly like firefly and medley, 1
will shrivel up and the sun, 1
rip up all of dream valley, 1
with this half the other half, 1
'd better wake up your bumbleness, 1
no point in talking to the, 1
there 's quite a few of, 1
looks after us and keeps us, 1
it be more fun to fly, 1
i will suffer along with the, 1
alonso i hope you 're not, 1
medal for being the greatest flying, 1
dump her in her own brew, 1
like a big gray storm cloud, 1
seen 'nuff ice cream for one, 1
you go sugar bon appetit as, 1
wait i 've come to talk, 1
little ponies and their friends have, 1
any moment the whole castle will, 1
things but this can of magic, 1
the balance of nature is preserved, 1
to the power of this horseshoe, 1
maybe one of your bubbles can, 1
why do n't you run along, 1
them if we go back to, 1
started when everything in paradise estate, 1
if we do not find water, 1
my heart has yearned for one, 1
even our tools are a mess, 1
of us want to see him, 1
now 's our chance to get, 1
is the right place to be, 1
the tinkle of utter flutter any, 1
a girl who had the rainbow, 1
books are one thing but what, 1
realm of darkness a sort of, 1
of their shadows being an outward, 1
make up your minds quickly we, 1
it on the bubble 's surface, 1
help us against grogar and you, 1
what is it with them today, 1
anything to reverse the effects of, 1
can do that others ca n't, 1
ask moffat here the wizard at, 1
i really like that sub-etheric discombobulator, 1
've chowed down the way we, 1
beauty in things which i have, 1
valentine watched her friend gallop away, 1
rescue megan and the rest of, 1
ago the most fearsome creature ever, 1
're running out of time little, 1
hard a port and set sail, 1
at the drop of a hat, 1
that darkness sends now begin the, 1
somehow caught the unicorns when they, 1
before we make any more trouble, 1
just do n't see why we, 1
ooh dear this cloak is practically, 1
looked like this would n't you, 1
almost saw us flying in here, 1
knight shade you know i 'm, 1
just whap it with your nose, 1
because we 're the only ones, 1
equal value to the one we, 1
i 'll just make another bubble, 1
bumble got the sunstone the witches, 1
henceforth you shall guard these crowns, 1
it is illogical to begin a, 1
illogical to begin a long journey, 1
could just get the honey off, 1
i 'm ready to start making, 1
i guess we 'd better get, 1
what if i slip off the, 1
gone back into the realm of, 1
is my faithful steed panza and, 1
we wo n't have anything to, 1
soon my little cutie everywhere we, 1
valley and grow all the flowers, 1
through when we needed them most, 1
but it did n't bother me, 1
heavy stone statues all the way, 1
i need four ponies for my, 1
could be put out to pasture, 1
get her hooves up out of, 1
's got ta to be some, 1
my unicorn magic and put it, 1
sense of accomplishment to make you, 1
sure wish i could wink through, 1
'll have to find some other, 1
but we 'll have to get, 1
and erebus are gon na come, 1
no such thing as bad luck, 1
are you going to stop believing, 1
hope megan and lofty are all, 1
tirrac the master of midnight castle, 1
got to sneak into his castle, 1
witches got flutter valley and we, 1
yourself all day or do you, 1
ca n't help but feel that, 1
seem to get to the book, 1
teach him a lesson he 'll, 1
you should talk to his elevated, 1
i 'm sure we 'll like, 1
we 'll be there in a, 1
when you like more now or, 1
better go fetch megan if you, 1
coin tells what kind of wish, 1
warm place filled with lots of, 1
there 's a lot to be, 1
i need to go find some, 1
his castle and swipe his rainbow, 1
dump and we wo n't be, 1
him but i just do n't, 1
find that peddler and prey he, 1
fetch megan if you can still, 1
sure could use someone who likes, 1
rainbow of light is the most, 1
all settle down and go back, 1
we should be able to beat, 1
might work if masquerade can fool, 1
n't think he 'll be back, 1
wanted to see of me is, 1
little thing i ca n't do, 1
of accomplishment to make you feel, 1
only thing that would cheer me, 1
the sound of ya all not, 1
we heard a scream what happened, 1
before squirk and crank get back, 1
have brought you here if you, 1
'm beautiful too do n't you, 1
it 'll come from one of, 1
i never really realized how nice, 1
do is find the other half, 1
this wo n't be the end, 1
's magic has gone funny too, 1
for them and so it was, 1
the best landing we 've had, 1
the sunstone and if we do, 1
may take anything from a child, 1
to give you a little test, 1
's not much time to find, 1
be absolutely squeaky clean through the, 1
'll blow that cloud so far, 1
clouds and we can start picking, 1
think they could have been kidnapped, 1
to find out is to ask, 1
he needs is a little heart, 1
was ready to give up then, 1
we can not part with it, 1
i really did n't mean to, 1
little plan that would turn bumbleland, 1
we think it 's due to, 1
get the sunstone back where it, 1
the lava demons and the ice, 1
sunstone and you right here in, 1
na give that obnoxious rockwhatis a, 1
the prince back in the dungeon, 1

if that looking-glass could use a, 1
if we only did things we, 1
know just how to handle ahhg, 1
this weather is simply death to, 1
was all i wanted to know, 1

want you all to meet fleetfoot, 1
so we 'll have to search, 1

you wan na help us here, 1
in diameter and the entire confection, 1
on his way to his trailer, 1
of finding them if we go, 1
with all the food they 'd, 1
to do is figure out a, 1
until you get out of grayvale, 1
ca n't reach the sunstone your, 1
it 's just that you 're, 1
has to live with the terrible, 1
is our belief that the hair, 1
rainbow first then the little ponies, 1
bees are so mean and tough, 1
right we can get out when, 1
could sell you all those things, 1
do n't we ask the flutter, 1
going to go after him right, 1
've never seen anything like them, 1
sweet stuff i saw mimic going, 1
magic seems to be working right, 1
uh come to think of it, 1
i wanted some triple fudge nut, 1
it 's okay i 've found, 1
allow me to join your band, 1
you would give us a new, 1
they were mean and tough before, 1
this is n't the way out, 1
to have these creatures transferred to, 1
satchel should be in one of, 1
have anything to fear from megan, 1
will save us somehow i just, 1
us into a lot of trouble, 1
wo n't be needing no porcina, 1
get his friend who thinks she, 1
have to go the rest of, 1
my bad attitude so now nothing, 1
but i 've never tried to, 1
lay our wands in the crowns, 1
creatures of flesh are alive just, 1
somewhere i just saw it now, 1
we 'll probably find the source, 1
have a big meal all ready, 1
i 'll also need to know, 1
so he 's a little clumsy, 1
to your hair porcina will turn, 1
the master said you 'd pay, 1
but remember you unicorns winking out, 1
really learn a lot from you, 1
it up because you are my, 1
megan is all the seaponies except, 1
better leave before the whole town, 1
he did n't really wan na, 1
stuck in this goop all day, 1
it 's just that i must, 1
nothing can happen to my true, 1
shady will compete in the earth, 1
'll come from one of your, 1
check with the other furbobs first, 1
and you did n't crash or, 1
sting and thank you for your, 1
no no no no you must, 1
hope you 'll forget what i, 1
who could imagine we 'd return, 1
rung grogar 's power will be, 1
can have our picnic after all, 1
never seen a storm clear up, 1
the duchess ascended to ze zrone--never, 1
it would attract the sun and, 1
here to ask you that is, 1
in your sandal and beat it, 1
giant creature was chasing you so, 1
mountains you ca n't miss it, 1
if you keep the sunstone we, 1
when you are king you may, 1
of you through these maze agreed, 1
then we 'll take care of, 1
of their best food stuffs and, 1
only way i can learn how, 1
the ice cream you want for, 1
better than my magic coins which, 1
i 'm sorry woebegone but you, 1
we can still get the sunstone, 1
why they got kicked out of, 1
glory said there 's nothing to, 1
my pretties not even when we, 1
n't just stand there with your, 1
is no time for a equivocation, 1
things neat but he well i, 1
'll have to ration what 's, 1
will belong to tirrac the master, 1
and if i miss the sunset, 1
you unicorns just disappear and re-appear, 1
's no threat to us now, 1
do with the legend of a, 1
realize that you 've got to, 1
you want to stay up for, 1
it 's just heating them up, 1
is all in her cloak and, 1
hope you 're not thinking of, 1
powerful enough to defeat him the, 1
n't mean to get in your, 1
that 's 'cause ahhgy 's doing, 1
now but believe me the morning, 1
of green cheese and i 'm, 1
only thing that might help defeat, 1
used the power of his magical, 1
we troggles were conquered by grogar, 1
know what 's good for you, 1
get you there in no time, 1
looking for a replacement for sir, 1
what we hoping would happen to, 1
look pretty dark right now but, 1
we 've got ta stop her, 1
maybe for now being here is, 1
the boys are modeling for you, 1
you just rest easy for a, 1
source from which our magic wands, 1
have no privileges you 're my, 1
us you think we 're ugly, 1

your good looks on hard work, 1
i 've longed to find one, 1
camp with all the food they, 1
that way we 're sure to, 1
youth from the other ponies and, 1
was the best landing we 've, 1
can have a day off every, 1
grown up quite a bit since, 1
a clue as to what we, 1
rude i do n't believe you, 1
i was saving this for a, 1
but i 'm a deserter besides, 1
gosh wind whistler how could you, 1
go the rest of the way, 1
my my i thought it was, 1
although zeb is the one who, 1
there are those who still hold, 1
why not stay with bushwoolies underground, 1
they 're all waiting for you, 1
before i turn you into toads, 1
to keeping things neat but he, 1
yeah i can move my wings, 1
're fat and greedy and selfish, 1
pals were kickin' around a kaleidostone, 1
i told you to take it, 1
and the pony surprise and will, 1
's throne room is right in, 1
helping a would-be knight to do, 1
how do we get past the, 1
's just that i must do, 1
n't make it to paradise estate, 1
mimic 's so weak it 's, 1
a search party and follow their, 1
toys and games in the whole, 1

ribbon say tambelon then i woke, 1
i do n't want to get, 1

these boys caused so much trouble, 1
slowly from the realm of darkness, 1

is worth the loss of my, 1
well with winter coming soon and, 1
floating castle that i ca n't, 1
's get a look at that, 1
back and everybody can take a, 1
have to go back to paradise, 1
of a nearby village for a, 1
it 's too fast for me, 1
the emerald idol 's in there, 1
them can get us into a, 1
more winking out until we know, 1
from our home on the other, 1
n't even make up my mind, 1
great gizmonks gock and gluda have, 1
i do n't think we should, 1
it he 's turning into a, 1
but believe me the morning is, 1
's wrong with a little rain, 1
you distract her with the kaleidostone, 1
state that the ball may not, 1
witch 's spell is broken that, 1
explain what happened to the unicorns, 1
court to find a replacement to, 1
bell is the repository of his, 1
but this can of magic paint, 1
it 's gon na get even, 1
you fool you 're out of, 1
'm the queen of the mountain, 1
will look nice compared to this, 1
it close enough perhaps we can, 1
there were some way to widen, 1
n't know then that the shadows, 1
to make him give those shadows, 1
you 've got to princess tiffany, 1
matter of fact you 're surrounded, 1
well we 're all set for, 1
sound clear and loud and the, 1
'll need the flutter ponies to, 1
do something before all those plants, 1
think it 's his elevated eminence, 1
the place has gone to seed, 1
nursery of paradise estate did n't, 1
fly with me and tell me, 1
and i might let you live, 1
those rocks look like they might, 1
only the crab nasties know how, 1
greatest ice cream flavor double banana, 1
'll do it i 'll do, 1
do n't want to go home, 1
who you are does n't matter, 1
could imagine we 'd return after, 1
the beast was pushed into the, 1
stacked as high as a tree, 1
legend mentioned something about a giant, 1
the dance of the seven waves, 1
longed to find one so fair, 1
well the magic has been put, 1
they 're probably mad at me, 1
that she 's put down some, 1
a funny looking creature who can, 1
and he has been for about, 1
have to get this to squirk, 1
orgs and lava demons can never, 1
the very last ice cream i, 1
lamp that aladdin fellow traded to, 1
an accident i 'm sure you, 1
party is for them baby tic-tac-toe, 1
anywhere now that she 's put, 1

as he was refused to be, 1
to think what might happen this, 1
touch shall be plagued no more, 1
me into scorpan when he took, 1
for us because we 're the, 1
i might as well see what, 1
the rainbow of light may be, 1
to come from somewhere and it, 1
grogar and you 'll be free, 1
seem to recall an ancient legend, 1
then come along my lovelies i, 1
a wall of briars around it, 1
way i can learn how to, 1
and i followed megan and the, 1
but but what about heart throb, 1
long time anyway which is when, 1
crunch the rockdog to protect the, 1
much for coming and waking me, 1
megan wind whistler i 'm so, 1
her being only a puppy i, 1
baby ribbon means is that you, 1

game for the rest of you, 1
dragons have certain criteria which must, 1
that 's exactly what i 'll, 1
've been walking and walking and, 1
friends knight shade turned against me, 1
estate did n't really collapse the, 1
all the ice cream toppings in, 1
this beast sat on my valentine, 1
be nice and maybe i 'll, 1
to come and judge the contest, 1
never had one get away from, 1
we 're really going to make, 1
oh what 'll i do without, 1
ruby in the crater of fire, 1
believe me the morning is gon, 1
to ponyland and help our friends, 1
all went back through door everything, 1
hope the others can make it, 1
you in a cage is it, 1
no no ooh no- no that, 1
yes but we need some nails, 1
place for anyone but us penguins, 1
of midnight as you should have, 1
sun is the lamp that lights, 1
that little jinx back i 'd, 1
father made them my protectors all, 1
think they 're headed this way, 1
morning glory honeysuckle please do n't, 1
but it was supposed to scare, 1
where they ca n't give us, 1
there a wall of briars around, 1
ice-cream cone should have lasted long, 1
like to honor you with this, 1
you 're standing on my dress, 1
rough lumps of rock into the, 1
nursery you go and no more, 1
to escape and make their way, 1
only babies get noticed 'round here, 1
me we can find a good, 1
'll give you discount on the, 1
why do n't you take a, 1
draw them off and catch up, 1
that means i 'm the only, 1
be able to but it would, 1
mothers i 'd bring you right, 1
they 're gone back into the, 1
fighting so long i guess we, 1
star you better go fetch megan, 1
maybe you 'd all better take, 1
pushed into the land of legends, 1
how good it really feels to, 1
could just find a way to, 1
so using his powerful flashstone squirk, 1
all that 's left to do, 1
think it 's a good idea, 1
my greatest ice cream flavor double, 1
some more sunlight the sunstone will, 1
count and--oh i just wished for, 1
here 's a chocolate cake rosedust, 1
's on the 50 the 40, 1
was trying to reach me telepathically, 1
the fireworks came from that way, 1
n't no place like--what can we, 1
to learn how to use the, 1
with the terrible shame of what, 1
our fields and flowers and spreads, 1
we have no master or money, 1
will if ya know what 's, 1
you can forgive me for pretending, 1
sun and the end of flutter, 1
much trouble you might allow me, 1
bumbleland 's on fire all right, 1
will be just the way we, 1
they will be turned into glass, 1
he-he-he turned the whole place back, 1
i think he is around here, 1
mean how did i do that, 1
heart throb and gusty and took, 1
the only thing that would cheer, 1
faster than you 've ever flown, 1
so we need your help to, 1
awaken her will be good enough, 1
so you can abuse me in, 1
wonderful red ball that can be, 1
this is no time for frivolity, 1
there 's nothing to be happy, 1
to teach her some magic tricks, 1
be the source of erebus ', 1
there 's something dangerous behind that, 1
're going to be in shape, 1
and we got our water back, 1
have powers over earth and stone, 1
heard my dad do it once, 1
we have a power of our, 1
'll get the rainbow first then, 1
as to what we 're looking, 1
can feel the power within me, 1
does sound like a good idea, 1
i 'm sorry all these terrible, 1

a gateway to the land of, 1
star before you do anything rash, 1
of us if we do n't, 1

if i did it would n't, 1
and get back to paradise estate, 1
love to visit the little ponies, 1
'd better not hurt baby moondancer, 1
and her new powers from the, 1
oh boy the pony olympics are, 1
the land to himself and so, 1
but the castle 's made out, 1
no feelings could remain calm at, 1
toot-sweet little ponies are here with, 1
all have different roles in the, 1
listen scorpan can i go with, 1
that i 'd never have any, 1
is n't a game for earth, 1
yes oh yes here it is, 1
oh they 're they 're ruined, 1
so there are probably all different, 1
going to make it i really, 1
where do we find water to, 1
potential energy meeting mass and being, 1
would attract the sun and the, 1
hate the flutter ponies too do, 1
those golden rays that will make, 1
one of those multi-colored dingbags is, 1
so a sorcerer forged the golden, 1
only-- all the pages in my, 1
have you outta there in a, 1
move it move it move it, 1
would give it to my true, 1
would risk anything for a friend, 1
is plenty of ze ice cream, 1
plan that would turn bumbleland into, 1
their trail while it 's still, 1
one get away from me before, 1
back to paradise estate and organize, 1
you sure this is the throne, 1
and that 's my pony tj, 1
duty to come and judge the, 1
outward sign of some loss of, 1
there now there 's nobody here, 1
this trouble 'cause only babies get, 1
dream valley the wind left her, 1
but does anybody even know that, 1
and for that we need help, 1
we just wanted to tell you, 1
like the flashstone 's can be, 1
baby cuddles why do n't you, 1
look what you 've done you, 1
of a carefully conceived plan to, 1
i have just had it yesterday, 1
'll fight it as long as, 1
do believe it 's a fire, 1
lose you become my servant forever, 1
it out and act your age, 1
i think we 'll need the, 1
light so that 's what we, 1
up to be your own special, 1
goons dancing around in funny clothes, 1
scree only bet on sure things, 1
the sunstone and the flutter ponies, 1
has to have--a knowledge of every, 1
may i speak to you a, 1
as i ask and no harm, 1
gizmonks are we 'll figure out, 1
am i glad to see you, 1
we 'd better go look for, 1
i wo n't let you hurt, 1
it 's supposed to scare us, 1
this when the big brothers cross, 1
it 's the most beautiful place, 1
maybe but we could n't have, 1
fix up the estate and i, 1
i want you to be my, 1
i am squire alonso and this, 1
and i 've been searching my, 1
i mean i could help rescue, 1
because our loved ones have lost, 1
door and they 'll all jump, 1
we get the sunstone and go, 1
's wanted to see of me, 1
this work without any glory or, 1
we 're looking for a magic, 1
seen the light so to speak, 1
that old tree uh must have, 1
dell dwellers who actually live below, 1
i think it 's simply marvelous, 1
admit it looks a little better, 1
your hair porcina will turn all, 1
ah well um actually well she, 1
we come back and see you, 1
to this the coins come from, 1
and emelita aileen 's fairy godmother, 1
place around here was underwater and, 1
rainbow is not such a safe, 1
longer until flutter valley rots hydia, 1
why do n't the stonebacks like, 1
window so you can see out, 1
you see crunch the ro--oh crunch, 1
ooh- get it ooh- ooh no, 1
a pond of her potion which, 1
time you considered going back where, 1
thought you locked suzette in her, 1
i know i am going to, 1
we 're okay we 're okay, 1
to decide who will be queen, 1
what have you two been up, 1
that overpass when we encounter it, 1
he 's here you 'll find, 1
too bad about that poor bushwoolie, 1
with the old witch floating in, 1
well uh it--it looks like we, 1
got some business ' to attend, 1
was looking for a replacement for, 1
and i will lead the way, 1
surely now you realize that you, 1
come on let 's go to, 1
anyway which is when all this, 1
have they were here just a, 1
i 'm not really good at, 1
were n't for those creatures guarding, 1
i 'm a furbob and i, 1
appeared 500 years ago and its, 1
you 'll know what it 's, 1
me a riddle i do n't, 1
'd better do something before they, 1
you do anything to reverse the, 1
have the troggles return them to, 1
everything a mother could do to, 1
slither really fast scorpan really fast, 1
and that 's how we do, 1
looks to me like the roof, 1
you might want to take notes, 1
's gon na be okay until, 1
perhaps i will let you go, 1
i just hope the baby seaponies, 1
ascertain forget-me-not and i are the, 1
more jaunt to the right and, 1
find a replacement to serve my, 1
i 'd bet five-to-one you 'd, 1
if galaxy had found ribbon and, 1
i believe i can expedite matters, 1
bubble is so big it 's, 1
told you you could do it, 1
it 's a beautiful day the, 1
you ever think that maybe the, 1
like any illness we 've ever, 1
beast was pushed into the land, 1
pretty and the crab nasties so, 1
you proved it with the tear, 1
estate will be anything but a, 1
some bad things in this world, 1
and a new broom and--oh i, 1
we can keep up with him, 1
put your friend on my back, 1
these wretched ponies a piece of, 1
cured of my bad attitude so, 1
it bubble it would expand and, 1
you that they have your brother, 1
you got ta give me your, 1
the kaleidostone while tattle and i, 1
all is in readiness master as, 1
more the evil be gone the, 1
she has a favor to ask, 1
sunstone will be back to normal, 1
she 'd kick me out of, 1
as he chased he went boom, 1
law are trapped where they ca, 1
spoil your good looks on hard, 1
i do hope they can rescue, 1
us could just escape and get, 1
only trying to teach her some, 1
we thought you might be interested, 1
my power to give it to, 1
n't help him he 'll steal, 1
set us free from the gizmonks, 1
okay whizzer you can carry messages, 1
looking for a musician called knight, 1
in a cage of stone till, 1
that 's what i wan na, 1
feeling we 're gon na find, 1
we 'd be-be-be-be back on our, 1
's one other chance the moochick, 1
the tear that melted the coldness, 1
the estate to get to the, 1
why that giant creature was chasing, 1
'm going to make you a, 1
's time for me to collect, 1
good life it 's very hard, 1
practically being crowded out of the, 1
'll never find it in all, 1

like any self respecting earth pony, 1
believe flowers could be capable of, 1
tambelon is the realm of darkness, 1
he 's made our lives miserable, 1
we 'd fix up the estate, 1
in the land of argyte four, 1
the hair of these here ponies, 1
say let 's help this guy, 1
and these creatures can afford to, 1
more fun to fly gracefully through, 1

roles in the land of legends, 1
you and your friends will pay, 1
of the keepers of the magic, 1

involved the moochick is the one, 1

his friend who thinks she 's, 1
it will consume paradise estate in, 1
space than we knows what to, 1

one who 'd live around here, 1
can bring the wands to it, 1
organisms are ruining the ecology of, 1
the sunstone flutter valley will be, 1
that 's a good one squirk, 1
mean it has not rained for, 1
be anything you want it to, 1
have a good time baby ribbon, 1
to but it would take too, 1
everything will be back to normal, 1
's nothing to do but play, 1
ought a show those newborn twins, 1
make that stuff in the crack, 1
i 've had enough exploring for, 1
i 'd make a bubble but, 1
the grundles that are left 'fraid, 1

the old witch floating in a, 1
pony will belong to tirrac the, 1
n't forget there are autumn chores, 1
arguing now let 's work to, 1
you come with me to the, 1
the problem is getting through that, 1
stay here any longer paradise estate, 1
but i 'm not exactly certain, 1
right an evil and nasty dictator, 1
he might tell us things if, 1
day so what 's so difficult, 1
just shoved that ol' witch right, 1
road and he sent zeb along, 1
you 've got to make that, 1
grogar used his magic the bell, 1
but megan the flories were so, 1
or he might go for the, 1
water would dry up this quickly, 1
do n't know exactly but they, 1
friends would like a tour of, 1
all right have some nice ice, 1
alonso and this is my faithful, 1
to be getting back to paradise, 1
thought flutter valley was ours mom, 1
anymore and i demanded that he, 1
have to do with mimic 's, 1
out of the volcano of gloom, 1
at paradise estate when the troggles, 1
the best toys and games in, 1
put right in ponyland again and, 1
magic coins which ai n't gon, 1
caught north star and spike they, 1
to have a little fun have, 1
note sing better than baby heart, 1
n't believe flowers could be capable, 1
that must be the real one, 1
ca n't fly much longer megan, 1
all it was probably my fault, 1
do n't know if i can, 1
're too big to fly on, 1
take them to the ponies ', 1
there 's no need for that, 1
have stayed to listen to what, 1
to beat those creepy plant things, 1
that the ball may not be, 1
whatever you do do n't spill, 1
i got ta be the monster, 1
we 'll find a place for, 1
any event paradise did n't say, 1

lickety-split danny and molly you get, 1
it looks like it 's gon, 1
ponies we know you 're here, 1

may learn something of consequence by, 1
promoted in bright valley was a, 1

city wall and grab his bell, 1
thought you might be interested in, 1
judge how good a dragon you, 1
why do n't you lead the, 1
then we can follow them secretly, 1
they 'll make good little slaves, 1
looks like some kind of squishy, 1
sweet stuff did n't really say, 1
next on the list is a, 1
going to rescue megan and the, 1
reason why ice orgs and lava, 1
like pony hair once it 's, 1
the rest of you follow after, 1
the whole land will be flooded, 1

if you were more like my, 1
to bumbleland and free the flutter, 1

a little plan that would turn, 1
all we got ta do is, 1
get noticed 'round here are newborn, 1

with the very one who stole, 1
to dump me but got dumped, 1
i say " be careful ", 1
they used all our hair to, 1
they were here just a little, 1
teensy bit guilty about what happened, 1
if by midnight my chariot does, 1

here was underwater and ruled by, 1
're the ruler you do something, 1
golden rays that will make bumbleland, 1

wonder if i can do that, 1
what 's all this here racket, 1

ta find buttons i got ta, 1
or if i even wan na, 1
think it 's grogar do you, 1
why are you hiding sweet stuff, 1
little ponies from getting to that, 1
the sunstone back before sunset or, 1
at the entrance to the cave, 1
dangerous crimson canyon that 's beyond, 1
little cutie everywhere we look we, 1
na let dumb guards stop us, 1
and forget-me-not were the only ones, 1
we could do it like this, 1
i 'd hear you say that, 1
what are you tryin' to do, 1
me when i have important things, 1
old troll would like to have, 1
i was not to be disturbed, 1
i 'll take care of that, 1

the fourth let its wearer float, 1
those frazzits are mixing up everyone, 1
na share our new home with, 1
i know i 'll go back, 1
and five yards to go steamer, 1
guess we 'd better get this, 1
wishing on them can get us, 1
the water reaches here i reckon, 1
you 've got to stop tirrac, 1
ponies so there are probably all, 1
was he taking them to erebus, 1
ugly and we 'll have a, 1
will i be able to admire, 1
it belongs to the child princess, 1
that 's exactly how we like, 1

magic is n't the end of, 1
help me turn this barrel over, 1
tirrac turned me into scorpan when, 1
galaxy get a load of this, 1
looking creature who can change into, 1
but i think you should know, 1
into his castle and swipe his, 1
are prisoners and resistance is useless, 1
've got a little piece of, 1
n't believe how happy he looks, 1
visions did not show why you, 1
this party is in their honor, 1
'll get right back to you, 1
been walking and walking and walking, 1
i feared an all-out ice cream, 1
what happens to bushwoolies who want, 1
on gang we 're gon na, 1
they have the ability to transform, 1
thanks for your help mr. moochick, 1
knight shade to thank for that, 1
be friends but it may take, 1
broom and--oh i could sell you, 1
n't wan na rule the world, 1
anybody got a clue as to, 1
but knight shade is not our, 1
has really had the power to, 1
where the baby ponies could be, 1
sunstone it would attract the sun, 1
suppose we 'll ever meet again, 1
got to be careful not to, 1
color to our fields and flowers, 1
're gon na start by stopping, 1
what we 've been looking for, 1
is feeling a little rambunctious today, 1
plenty of time to think of, 1
she creates a new kingdom for, 1
to the rest of the troggles, 1
the water would dry up this, 1
he looks like a big gray, 1
i was forced to come here, 1
why ca n't life be more, 1
the campgrounds before we move on, 1
n't want to know her better, 1
according to this the coins come, 1
n't want to go home alone, 1
i mean it has not rained, 1
be more like a storybook anyway, 1
we ca n't carry the sunstone, 1
you when you give them the, 1
got ta file our report on, 1
we ca n't stay here morning, 1
's one reason why ice orgs, 1
look at what he 's doing, 1
about a week off every summer, 1
get this to squirk right away, 1
the smooth stones danny likes to, 1
what a pity you ca n't, 1
to do something soon or grogar, 1
be the wrong coin for that, 1
my true love is named ariel, 1
friend i 'd just like to, 1
you heard have you heard about, 1
all this have to do with, 1
ice-cream cone and i mean a, 1
you can go as a princess, 1
i 've done to her and, 1
costume ball tonight you need your, 1
and he led us into a, 1
they manage to escape and make, 1
this is not like you gusty, 1
would dare to chase a bird, 1
in the satchel he was carrying, 1
said these monsters are just plants, 1
inside does n't mean it 's, 1
the realm of darkness with tambelon, 1
find the source of this cold, 1
let 's have a go at, 1
did they know we were coming, 1
ugh i 'm afraid we 're, 1
just wan na talk to you, 1
i think i 'm allergic to, 1
ever since the rainbow froze over, 1
has yearned for one as fair, 1
undine and the salamander uh a, 1
this way this way not far, 1
that could do with some improving, 1
's too far for me to, 1
i do n't hear the tinkle, 1
it 's the home of the, 1
mean we have to get help, 1
sorry i punched you in the, 1
have to go get 'em molly, 1
the back to count our treasures, 1
showing me pictures of goons dancing, 1
too mean to listen to reason, 1
a pain when it comes to, 1
was n't trying to hurt your, 1
them we 'd be the back-ups, 1
are here with their dear newborn, 1
's go watch flutter valley rot, 1
so a little visit is in, 1
chase us and we run away, 1
've been searching my whole life, 1
moochick said we have to find, 1
come on i never get to, 1
'm a furbob and i have, 1
had to leave his one true, 1
he was refused to be bullied, 1
how can we possibly save the, 1
make bubbles that are big and, 1
is on ze guard 's belt, 1
where the raptorians took the ponies, 1
tell us things if we ask, 1
it does n't look so dangerous, 1
you remember what happened the last, 1
they 'll all jump out yelling, 1
like to know what happened to, 1
're trying to thaw things out, 1
for sir huguenot and i decided, 1
something to do with the legend, 1
walls and that door is locked, 1
paint before you even met him, 1
do n't get it back to, 1
gon na make one last surveillance, 1
i 'll take good care of, 1
we 'll be back soon mimic, 1
to go the rest of the, 1
clouds have me worried buttons--'cause it, 1
am quite aware of just how, 1
threatened to steal my shadow and, 1
for a piece of hay in, 1
much effect on rocks would it, 1
dragons do n't swim very well, 1
ta file our report on this, 1
we 're going to flutter valley, 1
this tunnel should lead right to, 1
our chance to get the bell, 1
think i just might be able, 1
of your quest my little ponies, 1
you but you would n't listen, 1
the way we did back there, 1
go back and everybody can take, 1
each shoe gave her a magical, 1
is there somewhere else we can, 1
be listening to his nonsense anymore, 1
together we can overcome erebus and, 1
the flutter ponies and go down, 1
wonder what happens if a ghost, 1
these crabies once and for all, 1
what i feared an all-out ice, 1
there are no plants or trees, 1
ca n't stay there forever furbob, 1
oh i know it 's around, 1
sunstone it 's back to the, 1
make him give those shadows back, 1
gon na flood the land just, 1
she 'll get mad at me, 1
before you ponies lived here when, 1
could just escape and get some, 1
be needing no porcina no more, 1
knight shade can get me all, 1
thatta' way thatta' way yeah yeah, 1
of rock into the smooth stones, 1
end of it my pretties not, 1
welcome my little ponies what a, 1
a dozen raptorians abducted lickety split, 1
just the little ponies and not, 1
the magical gem that gives me, 1
my world will be filled with, 1
teach the tricks in my family, 1
job is just beginning and then, 1
would have been too much trouble, 1
then what are we waiting for, 1
'll try it grandfather but i, 1
we approach from different sides one, 1
what 'll i do without him, 1
have stuck with me my boy, 1
too far for me to wink, 1
i 'm in a hurry you, 1
but that took forever to build, 1
what if she 's gone on, 1
are hardly in a position to, 1
whistler means shady is just whap, 1
remember paradise telling us the legend, 1
shoop-shoop-bee-doo hi have you seen fizzy, 1
the most famous gizmonks in the, 1
let 's make a new rule, 1
can forgive me for pretending to, 1
big meal all ready for you, 1
did n't allow anyone to say, 1
you 're not going to take, 1
i do n't want to go, 1
up you can have gingerbread cookies, 1
it 's me that 's owed, 1
's voice on tape we can, 1
really did n't mean any harm, 1
watching us in the viewing pool, 1
we 've gotten away from lavan, 1
worry we 'll get you out, 1
's where we 're gon na, 1
somebody knocked us off the tracks, 1
we 've got to reach the, 1
consume paradise estate in a matter, 1
i 've already done the only, 1
it 's hard not to give, 1
i 'm sure that ribbon was, 1
say we just take the newborn, 1
face the other ponies if we, 1
have all the ice cream you, 1
be like if the stonebacks were, 1
simply just got to set your, 1
meantime we can all sit back, 1
it 's danny we 're waiting, 1
'll take you i 'll take, 1
beautiful golden rose in the haunted, 1
to g-g-go south for the w-winter, 1
rest of your kind will be, 1
gee sweet stuff i saw mimic, 1
close your eyes we 'll be, 1
not roll the head of your, 1
it seems as though everything is, 1
can fly over him megan but, 1
and you and you and you, 1
right anywhere in ponyland either and, 1
i think we 'd better be, 1
do n't have the right to, 1
all of our beautiful trees are, 1
this is no time for games, 1
could use someone who likes to, 1
me so proud to hear you, 1
'll forget what i did and, 1
fizzy so we can get out, 1
was a tyrant all right an, 1
you give them the rainbow of, 1
if she finds out we failed, 1
want to be friends but it, 1
paint touches will be transformed into, 1
we 're inside does n't mean, 1
what wind whistler means shady is, 1
will find another horseshoe stolen a, 1
such a safe place to live, 1
i think maybe where that thing, 1
does n't look good does it, 1
but what good would that do, 1
but the place has gone to, 1
guess i just do n't have, 1
no unicorns can only wink out, 1
dare to chase a bird that, 1
babies need a lot of attention, 1
off every time the mushrooms bloom, 1
you 're gon na be great, 1
free to stop this knight shade, 1
as bad off as the poor, 1
porcina turn 'em all into glass, 1
you do n't actually believe that, 1
pollen count and--oh i just wished, 1
can try it if you like, 1
you can wish the fire out, 1
she was separated from them by, 1
you seen the book i was, 1
me how to drain the magic, 1
four legs in the morning two, 1
to drive fudgy mcswain out of, 1
you 're one of us now, 1
's about the giant that goes, 1
better be moving on to furbobia, 1
bring you another treasure do you, 1
then say goodbye to baby moondancer, 1
not have defeated lavan without your, 1
pony hair once it 's cut, 1
you can have all the ice, 1
the party faster than you can, 1
you think has happened to our, 1
look up there on that high, 1
i believe the coins are responsible, 1
princess ponies and how they guard, 1
the locket with the rainbow of, 1
it 's just a silly sunstone, 1
well i suppose i could sing, 1
uh so sorry for the intrusion, 1
realized you 're too big to, 1
inadvertently released them and upset the, 1
you know what 's causing all, 1
we help you dig it up, 1
there 's nothing you can do, 1
you 'd pay and now it, 1
are probably all different kinds of, 1
's frozen solid inside the ice, 1
a better job ourselves do n't, 1
rocky must have gotten careless and, 1
be a fearful place for all, 1
so reign in that curiosity of, 1
i have to think of everything, 1
need clever and beautiful hair groomer, 1
shade and try to get them, 1
become so ugly without the sunstone, 1
was not suffering from a singular, 1
that can help her now is, 1
but guess what i 'm gon, 1
but i bet sweet stuff and, 1
especially the cupcakes 'cause if you, 1
sick and we think it 's, 1
just stop flooding the land squirk, 1
gusty and took them with them, 1
a partner and the first team, 1
the simplest little thing i ca, 1
where did i put that thing, 1
to you where we 're going, 1
let 's keep out of sight, 1
and your pa most would be, 1
in this place there 's nothing, 1
i was you know jumping up, 1
am the ghost of paradise estate, 1
you be better off tryin' it, 1
helped us furbobs so we 'll, 1
down here forever unless megan and, 1
of darkness to ponyland maybe one, 1
had the power to do anything, 1
it we ask it to go, 1
we can overcome erebus and zeb, 1
the land squirk and we 'll, 1
i 'm off to slay a, 1
am cara keeper of the gate, 1
is one hot bath we wo, 1
she sleeps kiss and awaken her, 1
come from somewhere and it normally, 1
this cloak is practically worthless now, 1
the recipe disappears and fudgy mcswain, 1
now help me replace all these, 1
glad you 've all seen the, 1
've probably just had a little, 1
my problem is that my true, 1
going to get it there rosedust, 1
that bad luck down on yourself, 1
back with help you 'll be, 1
do you mean " what good, 1
off and catch up at the, 1
it 's true you are not, 1
to the hypothesis that a strange, 1
we 'd read their minds if, 1
it and that 's all i, 1
doing when he had to leave, 1
now if only we can find, 1
squirt and tattered wretch run through, 1
can take you wherever you wish, 1
very well but remember you unicorns, 1
to get the baby ponies ', 1
one thing but what i need, 1
of you protect the little ponies, 1
's out there i 'm sure, 1
we got to do something soon, 1
then it 's goodbye sun goodbye, 1
're gon na be nice and, 1
just because we 're inside does, 1
now give it a real test, 1
pretties not even when we have, 1
we 're all aware that there, 1
would you rather be up there, 1
exactly certain what will happen when, 1
it 's megan and sky dancer, 1
feast of my godchild and her, 1
n't come to to fight they, 1
troggles enjoy living in ponyland drog, 1
i 'm gon na make one, 1
there is no need to keep, 1
where we 'll find his elevated, 1
got ta lot of nerve showin', 1
i think i 'd just better, 1
it-it seemed like a good idea, 1
do n't let them get us, 1
to this niblick and ask him, 1
and now that you 've graduated, 1
i tried to tell you paradise, 1
would-be knight to do a good, 1
we got the big cheesies hurr, 1
exchange it for the real one, 1
many times in the last year, 1
sorry about getting lost last night, 1
and grab them that 's how, 1
little ponies in ponyland i 'd, 1
lickety-split it wo n't be long, 1
this image of a bunch of, 1
rrowff rrowff rrowff rrowff rrowff ah, 1
any musical talents yourselves do you, 1
us but paradise estate is still, 1
something to do with grogar 's, 1
if we use the bushwoolie hair, 1
the way but well it could, 1
only is he quitting but we, 1
to dream valley and tell the, 1
we 're never going to break, 1
we 're the ones who need, 1
be as bad off as the, 1
to do is make a wish, 1
like the moochick 's magic has, 1
sky and play with your friends, 1
have been slow to respond to, 1
under the ocean for more fun, 1
well i still think i 'm, 1
made another 's thoughts " sound, 1
will be no more ponies in, 1
weather is simply death to my, 1
we need your help to get, 1
it to my true love but, 1
could n't he just lose a, 1
this is more like a barn, 1
's a big guy like you, 1
do n't tell anyone where you, 1
yeah we 're rich we 're, 1
and now it 's time for, 1
the crab nasties so horrible looking, 1
as well see what the inside, 1
to ask you about some new, 1
well i guess that does n't, 1
both of you is thinkin' worser, 1
the game is over little ponies, 1
no no tumbleweed you are mine, 1
so we can get on with, 1
pony surprise and will give them, 1
little pipsqueak like him would only, 1
it just might work if masquerade, 1
he might upset the magical foundation, 1
they said use it any time, 1
n't know and the horseshoe is, 1
uh i think bumbleland 's on, 1
greatest flying pony of all time, 1
and the longer erebus chased after, 1
rather your friend knight shade did, 1
all the green hills around here, 1
him exerting himself long enough we, 1
need a little sunshine in your, 1
and you proved it with the, 1
is not such a safe place, 1
guess i do get confused once, 1
to guide you back to ponyland, 1
i 'm beautiful too do n't, 1
the spell 's over now that, 1
tear that melted the coldness of, 1
i say what was all that, 1
just might be able to but, 1
only useless but i 'm a, 1
is end of your quest my, 1
we promised we 'd fix up, 1
my mother to the way they, 1
run run run run run run, 1
do n't you let us go, 1
please do n't do this to, 1
and tell the girl with the, 1
they 'll never get past him, 1
your friends in the white puffy, 1
babies they walk as adults and, 1
we 've been trying to stay, 1
garth can awaken ariel with a, 1
what would dare to chase a, 1
way to release the magic in, 1
na be backup singer for knight, 1
to furbobia and get the rest, 1
to stay up for the costume, 1
is a pond due south about, 1
much better you can do when, 1
mentioned something about a giant bell, 1
your philosophy sting and remove my, 1
thought that big aligatorwhatsit did it, 1
's just that you 're the, 1
you grogar plans to exile the, 1
not much the only thing that, 1
surprised if your fire breathing powers, 1
a pleasure to meet all of, 1

you have to go to dream, 1
place the sunstone to reflect the, 1
you heard her let 's do, 1

the crab nasties were right after, 1
to set your mind to it, 1
how you like it when you, 1
get even with those flutter ponies, 1
and the others here in hopes, 1
uh i think you 'd better, 1
do you think you 're hitting, 1

actually well she thought it would, 1
in the wands for my own, 1

i 'm never gon na fly, 1

n't you ever heard the one, 1
of this as giving up hey, 1
all aware that there are more, 1
but we got to do something, 1
too many of paradise 's stories, 1
if not for you i might, 1
got ta do better than that, 1
let me clean what 's underneath, 1
nut caramel ice cream and all, 1
upon a time there was a, 1
can we blow up balloons sundance, 1
're not gon na let you, 1
the right and you 're there, 1
i 'll get even with those, 1
to be known as dream valley, 1
we can blow down these walls, 1
remember slugger buttons is probably on, 1
and catch up at the mountains, 1
i would give it to my, 1
golden horseshoes have been carried farther, 1
so only the man who is, 1
the important thing is that we, 1
we 'd better be moving on, 1
the power of light so that, 1
a different song but i 'm, 1
in the night that never ends, 1
and i do hope you can, 1
master honest i mean honestly he, 1
come on they could n't have, 1
suppose we 've really nothing to, 1
's never this hard in fairytales, 1
well let 's see what we, 1
's the first day of fall, 1
the hooves of this special unicorn, 1
know it started when i was, 1
need it to save our friend, 1
's help them if we can, 1
rocky ripple just confused 'bout you, 1
megan thank goodness you 're here, 1
nice pet like what you got, 1
be rude or anything but the, 1
not all little ponies can fly, 1
collect keep and trade junk and, 1
like these started the heat wave, 1
hey you guys look it 's, 1
is just awful all this mud, 1
you do do n't spill it, 1
with your friends in the white, 1
certainly are letting this place get, 1
lure grogar outside the city wall, 1
be happy to do our bidding, 1
one last surveillance flight before we, 1
and we brought you some bush, 1
here these living breathing trembling creatures, 1
ask if " baby tiddly okay, 1
'll use your pocket tape recorder, 1
what 's ice cream without toppings, 1
he took the flashstone away from, 1
wait you come over and see, 1
need to go find some dragons, 1
here for lunch so she winked, 1
looked all over i mean all, 1
wait a minute these are my, 1
'll be as bad off as, 1
're the safest and soundest of, 1
just might be able to help, 1
that the shadows provided erebus with, 1
what a wonderful thought to be, 1
were here she 'd know what, 1
but i could n't find her, 1
on sniffles take food from baby, 1
you could break your own cold, 1
's too many of you to, 1
oh well of course i do, 1
estate in a matter of hours, 1
the others and we 'll lead, 1
have just got to sit down, 1
me and your pa most would, 1
you do n't think they 're, 1
she should n't make fun of, 1
and how much it looks like, 1
walk through that door and they, 1
say we go back in there, 1
so the giant chased after the, 1
deed with just a little help, 1
this hero aileen 's wed attracts, 1
've just passed the top-up-turtle test, 1
it it 's a long way, 1
you did n't push that old, 1
a covert surveillance and report back, 1
power which he uses to make, 1
we just take the newborn twins, 1
have to go to dream valley, 1
up here at one of the, 1
see what your fighting has done, 1
hmm i guess we should let, 1
you want the horseshoe to save, 1
the locket that her brother and, 1
thanks to your hair porcina will, 1
you have broken my spell which, 1
because of the heat that we, 1
know what 's wrong but we, 1
and i 'll also need to, 1
takes the ability to appreciate the, 1
make my merry men a bit, 1
oh i just ca n't wait, 1
that 's the dumbest thing i, 1
'll never rule this land again, 1
hiding from us in the bushes, 1
i guess it 's better than, 1
far for me to wink to, 1
baby cuddles do n't leave me, 1
bushwoolie who was lost in the, 1
hear the tinkle of utter flutter, 1
him if you would give us, 1
and the rest of grayvale 's, 1
you can see why we need, 1
i ca n't seem to get, 1
i want the sunstone and you, 1
there is plenty of ze ice, 1
north star you come with me, 1
and i demanded that he give, 1
i am going to regret it, 1
n't backfire on us this time, 1
me the wisdom of your philosophy, 1
you how to be a great, 1
never seen a storm come up, 1
i am especially interested in the, 1
i had n't been so overly, 1
they might cancel out the telepathic, 1
eighty years or so when i, 1
bray 's voice on tape we, 1
how will i be able to, 1
mad when he hears about this, 1
and she said we could go, 1
shadow including my own mother 's, 1
ca n't do this to a, 1
let 's see where did i, 1
could be happening to the baby, 1
i know we sent it over, 1
if you do n't trust me, 1
a second there i thought my, 1
so let 's all settle down, 1
only been a couple of seconds, 1
now let 's get out of, 1
was n't exactly a big success, 1
blazing light " the third made, 1
this place sure could use someone, 1
lavan tries to use the wands, 1
hunt for the horseshoes habbit and, 1
north star are you all right, 1
all this work without any glory, 1
you can expect more where that, 1
them than there appears to be, 1
what erebus had done i refused, 1
fillies when we get home eh, 1
'll think you 're the greatest, 1
nothing any of us can do, 1
got ta think of a way, 1
more green and and- and- and-, 1
guess you could stay with them, 1
to be your own special little, 1
the sun stone 's going to, 1
everyone in case they need it, 1
on the other side of the, 1
four-legged suckers the long claws of, 1
that 'll teach him a lesson, 1
and her bees are so mean, 1
me clean what 's underneath and--what, 1
you so you can thaw out, 1
sunstone and if we do n't, 1
please mr. mayor you must let, 1
material that the boys are modeling, 1
maybe her horn could help him, 1
her friends what she 's seen, 1
're inside does n't mean it, 1
and the sheriff can circle through, 1
'm not even sure zeb knows, 1
and the sunstone will be back, 1
grogar swore he would return in, 1
that is a a very smart, 1
world will be frozen over all, 1
earth ponies pegasi flutter ponies so, 1
one 's no threat to us, 1
i 'll speak to my old, 1
think we 've all grown up, 1
accidentally creating a cold ferocious beast, 1
one 's ever been here before, 1
we 'll start making some really, 1
of blazing light " the third, 1
a wonderful mother but she--she has, 1
it must belong to a princess, 1
leave ya but they 'll always, 1
it 's just what i feared, 1
time i tried to tell you, 1
coming soon and her being only, 1
i 've got ta do is, 1
'll get you there in no, 1
fix these crabies once and for, 1
you wan na join the tour, 1
well that cloak was probably never, 1
we 'll help you anyway we, 1
i suggest we traverse that overpass, 1
's go to dream valley so, 1
you mean dinah will leave now, 1
's fun but--well you are spoilin', 1
guy like you chasin' a little, 1
in an enchanted slumber in a, 1
i 've done everything a mother, 1
's been getting her youth from, 1
you 've just passed the top-up-turtle, 1
ah you 've been listening to, 1
's the horseshoe but what can, 1
from the other ponies and her, 1
maybe we better follow the trail, 1
was about to turn yellow into, 1
fear we sha n't be able, 1
going in the back to count, 1
then we get another one for, 1
like we 'll ever be able, 1
but sire what of the prince, 1
ca n't stand our touch anymore, 1
with my radiance my own extraordinary, 1
well i guess that cooled her, 1
got a clue as to what, 1
's it hit it water lily, 1
why ca n't you make horseshoes, 1
i think that 's what grandfather, 1
we ca n't let others just, 1
need your help to get the, 1
's built a lot of booby, 1
are letting this place get rundown, 1
dinah got a whole lot of, 1
time it right we can get, 1
're getting to be big dragon, 1
yellow into blue uh i think, 1
not long survive out of their, 1
it we 'll have to use, 1
goblins just caught north star and, 1
estate to get to the amulet, 1
ca n't you make horseshoes for, 1
were here just a little while, 1
's something fishy going on here, 1
and spreads beauty and love with, 1
fleetfoot i challenge you to a, 1
pets like mama and we have, 1
i 'm sorry i punched you, 1
this is just awful all this, 1
go way to go north star, 1
enough we 'll be able to, 1
your heart just like you 'll, 1
mr. moochick mimic is sick and, 1
behalf of all the little ponies, 1
until we get the sunstone and, 1
of our beautiful trees are barren, 1
're getting ready to move on, 1
beat those creepy plant things together, 1
you go do you think you, 1
time anyone saw a bird or, 1
that 'll show hydia she should, 1
and and- and- and- and- and-crunch, 1
they do magnificent work making rough, 1
your robin 's egg blue your, 1
on we 'll make it together, 1
we go to the purple mountains, 1
yeah it 's all right all, 1
this is one hot bath we, 1
before that shell gives out maybe, 1
've come after us. to hunt, 1
can get ya home in a, 1
let 's take it back to, 1
feel sick too sick to fly, 1
but fizzy took control and restored, 1
try to get a few drops, 1
we 've gone as far as, 1
have more fun if you were, 1
they gon na destroy each other, 1
wants us to go around the, 1
who let those horses in here, 1
that there are more important things, 1
appear to be making matters worse, 1
catrina that 's not exactly true, 1
now we 're all aware that, 1
metaphysical power of these coins can, 1
i had a feeling you might, 1
i must be even more magnificent, 1
's too bad about that poor, 1
've done to her and grayvale, 1
on that side of the bed, 1
little ponies we know you 're, 1
all he said he wanted in, 1
out a way to break into, 1
did notice that whenever grogar used, 1
what do you think niblick would, 1
you will complete the work of, 1
second thought maybe it 's that, 1
thought--that i 'd be concerned about, 1
rainbow of light is the only, 1
got ta know if she 's, 1
this is what is causing all, 1
ca n't even see my feet, 1
we 're trying to thaw things, 1
let him go he did n't, 1
salamander uh a water creature and, 1
and i 'll find it first, 1
in carton of your ice cream, 1
where we can find his elevated, 1
n't gon na share our new, 1
see you can actually do three, 1
n't you take him with you, 1
would be like if the stonebacks, 1
want to spoil the game for, 1
ca n't let anything stop us, 1
paradise and i will get to, 1
hard not to give up hope, 1
there 's nothing any of us, 1
me whoever you are but do, 1
looks like it 'll last forever, 1
i 'm worried about the snow, 1
an eye on them we 'd, 1
important things to do around here, 1
sake girl just quit belly-aching and, 1
flutter ponies and the sunstone too, 1
the horseshoes they might cancel out, 1
anything dangerous be behind such a, 1
i 'm the prince philippe de, 1
maybe if the honey melts enough, 1
i 'm glad we did this, 1
oh me maybe somebody else should, 1
i think now we 're all, 1
this is how we do it, 1
famous and you could have supplied, 1
sunlight and the sunstone will be, 1
've got ta catch knight shade, 1
would n't have much effect on, 1
be known as dream valley a, 1
trying to slay him to do, 1
are you going to get it, 1
you call my father good king, 1
or put out the salamander 's, 1
your heart you know the way, 1
its wearer float like a cloud, 1
make the sand soft garth like, 1
of course they 're alive heart, 1
we know they 're down there, 1
not here and they 're not, 1
you do n't trust me trust, 1
thought you were at the dungeon, 1
stayed to listen to what the, 1
do with us or paradise estate, 1
and i 've been looking for, 1
are a myriad springs and rapids, 1
in the first place that you, 1
wan na play rough do they, 1
then i 'll get the next, 1
'm gon na make one last, 1
i could predict north star 's, 1
i get you some more nectar, 1
the first to feel the glassy, 1
i 've got ta think of, 1
sunlight the sunstone will fade forever, 1
to know what happened to your, 1
did n't see it with the, 1
we 'll find out what 's, 1
the beauty in things which i, 1
so bad once you get to, 1
the way there was a strange, 1
i can or if i even, 1
tell her she 'll always be, 1
enough to drop the nets on, 1
them to hate me so much, 1
uh you do know how to, 1
a water creature and a fire, 1
i would risk anything for a, 1
get these banners and bows and, 1
all looking so bright and colorful, 1
are the only two flutter ponies, 1
cloud will shrivel up and the, 1
up in a cage of stone, 1
happened to your chest of magic, 1
can just get loose before that, 1
squirk and we 'll do whatever, 1
he said he wanted in return, 1
lives in the mushromp over there, 1
just do n't have what it, 1
the rainbow is not such a, 1
my good luck collection for safekeeping, 1
anyone else to play with you, 1
and keeping you in a cage, 1
indestructible i had put a piece, 1
hey watch where you 're goin', 1
me that 's owed the apology, 1
we 're inside the walls of, 1
" and so the giant chased, 1
this machine it creates a wind, 1
when you stand with the very, 1
have n't passed the worst of, 1
you turn on me knight shade, 1
creatures can afford to wait that, 1
what 's to become of me, 1
place that used to be called, 1
tries to use the wands he, 1
