for trying to protect, 1
wonderful it was wintry, 1
n't that be fun, 1
your crew to their, 1
real princess of the, 1
a strange and dark, 1
pinkie pie just got, 1

you miss the train, 1
incorporated into their routine, 1
you must be here, 1
celestia is almost overdue, 1
much authority to a, 1
