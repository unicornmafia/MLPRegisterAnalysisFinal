that everything is tasty enough, 2
all about you do the, 2

have you looked around this, 1
it is my great honor, 1
we could have been having, 1
any o' y'all right now, 1
in the name of celestia, 1

our final competitor of the, 1
sense to tell me what, 1
if y'all just be patient, 1

there and check it out, 1
have that for a cutie, 1
with the tart tanginess of, 1
you could get here in, 1

in one hour to satisfy, 1
they 've taken rarity down, 1
she 's calling to me, 1
bit of salt just a, 1
who 's the most athletic, 1
to strip you of your, 1

the thrill of discovering who, 1
i 'm saying is that, 1
about you but i ca, 1
now who wants s'mores then, 1
sequins just so or the, 1
creation when who should stop, 1

right afterwards there was amazing, 1
i get anypony more punch, 1

i ca n't at least, 1
bad pitch for a pony, 1
you do n't come back, 1
would invite pinkie pie so, 1
farewell party why does the, 1
'm not talking about my, 1
have another party soon and, 1
startled because while being surprised, 1
to you like caramel to, 1
and losing a friend 's, 1
ca n't wear this old, 1
short notice but we had, 1
try to force you as, 1
the punch has been spiked, 1
all the willies do n't, 1
him and got better in, 1
's hear for all our, 1
of the local reservoir and, 1
key then moved into the, 1
would introduce me to him, 1
the only thing they 'll, 1
me lend you a hoof, 1
wishing or begging will make, 1
it helped me to learn, 1
so afraid of being thought, 1
sorry everypony for bringing gilda, 1
jays and green jays pink, 1
last week you went into, 1
gon na get my mark, 1
do n't be afraid to, 1
i 'm all dragon see, 1
equestria are all you arguing, 1
na find our special talent, 1
when you were turning this, 1
themselves all worked up over, 1
style with adherence making sure, 1
we exemplify what good friends, 1
maybe rainbow dash will have, 1
fluttershy may be the one, 1
should forget the sonic rainboom, 1
is mare do well this, 1
you know that after she, 1
can carry on aimlessly wandering, 1
with this insulting celebration we, 1
i 'm far too busy, 1
i 'm only involved as, 1
as amazing as cadance to, 1
and i saw how miserable, 1
i guess the princess has, 1
did n't think i needed, 1
the biggest most important production, 1
rainbow dash is flying away, 1
sleep last night 'cause i, 1
because while being surprised can, 1
last year fillydelphia broke the, 1
than that do n't you, 1
to the mastery of the, 1
you keep yer creepy mumbo-jumbo, 1
just get one present from, 1
nightmare she is with scheduling, 1
month she comes into ponyville, 1
so what is the best, 1
time i make a mess, 1
it 's widdle rarity who, 1
have one more day to, 1
us why it was so, 1
's awful strong for such, 1
potions i had to mix, 1
's well it no okay, 1
you decided to throw me, 1
how can they be lucky, 1
for why we could n't, 1
can you believe featherweight got, 1
you are never gon na, 1
you did n't love me, 1
mascarpone meringue madness it 's, 1
few days it might as, 1
back so i guess everything, 1
looks good on ya rainbow, 1
so much to catch up, 1
to see me competing in, 1
later and i caught up, 1
not that grown up just, 1
the apertures on the nine-and-quarter, 1
mama duck you 're free, 1
'd you get all this, 1
shall change this dreadful celebration, 1
i do have that effect, 1
to think i do n't, 1
there 's just plain rude, 1
prince and princess were so, 1
featherweight to start working overtime, 1
in the clear which means, 1
you mare do we e, 1
if you are not one, 1
take some pictures of my, 1
decide i just ca n't, 1
would never associate with anyone, 1
and i 'd like to, 1
full of phoenix eggs nearby, 1
fussy pickin' up all those, 1
now if you could just, 1
you can mix up a, 1
make quite a letter to, 1
will stop me from keeping, 1
be mice again at midnight, 1
of you and giving me, 1
is n't this what you, 1
the everfree forest to zecora, 1
we 're sorry diamond tiara, 1
this proves perhaps conclusively that, 1
me to stay in one, 1
may the best sisters win, 1
i think we 're getting, 1
the whole thing you know, 1
then all the ancient evil, 1
be sure to save you, 1
weeds that were attempting to, 1
of the changelings it is, 1
will you please leave me, 1

i 'm banished too somewhere, 1
little birds or monkeys or, 1
charge from choosing the stories, 1

man was that a great, 1
but instead i 'm just, 1
does this mean that you, 1
yourself but you are sadly, 1
but those dragons mean business, 1
if they were just one, 1
celestia and before ponies discovered, 1
does she think she is, 1
of events to decide which, 1
'm so sorry i 'm, 1
all the she thinks i, 1
luck to say " good, 1

to let the sunshine in, 1
of his chores big mac, 1
poured myself into learning everything, 1

from all this icky muck, 1
applejack says these things take, 1

i could n't come home, 1
up for it and all, 1
to be ready for a, 1
this winter wrap up stuff, 1
for it is the best, 1
what in equestria is that, 1
like we finally agree on, 1

to see madame pinkie and, 1
about accepting each others ', 1
should just humor them for, 1
well i- i always put, 1

we brought our new pal, 1
run of the mill citizen, 1
royal highness princess celestia of, 1

and dustin' myself off but, 1
what 's the matter pinkie, 1
better see what she wants, 1
the dragon if things get, 1
so bad for this group, 1
that i was hiding a, 1
gather all this extra water, 1
in a new and wondrous, 1
last sign has come true, 1
who reassured me when i, 1
not taking it out on, 1

guilty but we just want, 1
him he ruled equestria in, 1

to distract us from what, 1
each other instead of shaking, 1
entrance to the central temple, 1
the meanest kind of mean, 1
you come to check out, 1
in these awkward situations because, 1
like twilight said there 's, 1
which way do we go, 1
dangerous creature from the everfree, 1
and i designed each outfit, 1

just like harvestin' the zap, 1
and turn elizabeak and my, 1
that she had sought tirelessly, 1
why you are my number, 1
a lout you 're better, 1
way to know what was, 1

ponies would schedule a dreadful, 1
use my winnings to fix, 1
i ca n't take this, 1
complete your jobs on time, 1
that the flower smells good, 1
" change of scenery ", 1

good care of our two, 1
my friends pinkie pie and, 1

mind to find your mother, 1

for her to ruin everything, 1
by and say thank you, 1
girl now pumpkin-wumpkin and stay, 1

how embarrassing it must be, 1

some sort of common fly, 1
for the offer i mean, 1
i have to go too, 1
the rocks from the south, 1
on a secluded private part, 1
mean nay children no wait, 1
what is important is that, 1
able to keep your ball, 1
've always always always wanted, 1
tribes had to share it, 1
all promised we 'd be, 1
maybe we should all settle, 1
so what are we gon, 1

the real princess mi amore, 1

what in equestria are all, 1
oh i ca n't wait, 1
the better of all of, 1
well sure can pull off, 1
wo n't look like a, 1
to pony up and confront, 1
case we do n't make, 1
were carrying so much tension, 1
are use that nervous energy, 1
in this world you just, 1
into that group for like, 1
'll just laugh some more, 1
n't know why we had, 1
done everything on the list, 1
got ta be extra friendly, 1
n't want to believe you, 1
for all the tea in, 1
romance but this has been, 1
thinking i 'm not taking, 1
elements of harmony she defeated, 1
to be crazy not to, 1
be overly critical of something, 1
return the fan to you, 1
safely landing on the other, 1
with the stuff you know, 1
maybe i 'm just a, 1
down-home apples are plenty good, 1
i heard voices over here, 1
there 's been an avalanche, 1
but i did n't let, 1
scream when she gobbles her, 1
it says so in the, 1
[ that 's not fair, 1
" being a good friend, 1
bring out the strangest ponies, 1
we need to get some, 1
if i ever saw one, 1
the pony for the job, 1
i 'm certain they 're, 1
celestia what do you think, 1
's impossible to control who, 1
but where 's the sixth, 1
i challenge spike to a, 1
now i think we deserve, 1
must say i was impressed, 1
never have too many friends, 1
maybe even before she 's, 1
counted and the winner will, 1
so many wonders casting its, 1
day the younger unicorn refused, 1
dash and fluttershy had to, 1
yard and give us all, 1
are you waiting for spike, 1
searching all over equestria for, 1
of shaking down leaves many, 1
's always great running into, 1
you something worthy of canterlot, 1
i wan na hear you, 1
the things they do when, 1
my head too you know, 1
near the everfree forest and, 1
visit from apple bloom some, 1
's what i was doing, 1
will bring about everlasting night, 1
unstoppable. to get to the, 1
maybe gilda is n't a, 1
rest of this snow here, 1
i 'll never get to, 1
lead does n't turn out, 1
else time to disaster-proof equestria, 1
i cut lines in the, 1
now now let 's settle, 1
is the most famous fashion, 1
uh do you know any, 1
far too powerful and dangerous, 1
is " yes it 's, 1
is a farewell party why, 1
am her student and i, 1
but i 'm afraid this, 1

some neigh-sayers in the audience, 1

beneath canterlot once home to, 1
call you is " loser, 1
model you could always quit, 1
what you 're thinkin' of, 1
to find our own special, 1
and before ponies discovered our, 1
's rainbow it 's applejack, 1
i was gon na tell, 1
need to know is that, 1
n't tell me you believe, 1
us some time to track, 1
clues especially an obvious clue, 1
if she 's got a, 1
do n't you know who, 1

quadruple to leave them in, 1
calmed a sorrowful serpent with, 1

i knew there was critters, 1
we ca n't sell the, 1
at hand has been my, 1
a slumber party is have, 1
best friends there with me, 1
i do n't like ponies, 1
he knows how powerful our, 1
needs to be about 20%, 1
all to pieces disastrous if, 1
thought the stomach ache would, 1
but spike told me it, 1
're our hero rainbow dash, 1
demonstrated discord so well that, 1
it 's the most wonderfulest, 1
days at the junior speedsters, 1
says twilight sparkle thinks ponyville, 1
until we get all these, 1
brash perhaps quite fetching hook, 1
flown through it a million, 1
's just what twilight said, 1
get a top speed over, 1
is the life is n't, 1
was good but i did, 1
could skip your catchphrase and, 1
these bright shiny apples sealed, 1
careful you 're gon na, 1
energy and eat less food, 1
am i not royal enough, 1
else she wanted to tell, 1
felt so lovely in all, 1
be patient we 'll have, 1
from meeting my true love, 1
where i 'd fit in, 1
what could make them happier, 1
a pony 's flank when, 1
" but that does n't, 1
i have just the thing, 1
on account of i just, 1
and that 's when it, 1
whenever zecora comes to town, 1
rarity told me i must, 1
and to believe in yourself, 1
guess i 'd better get, 1
zap apples had its special, 1
if we take out these, 1
kumquat pickle barrel kumquat chimicherrychanga, 1
to warm up but still, 1
'm sure i can learn, 1
'd like to tell y'all, 1
and welcome to the nightmare, 1
one first prize and i, 1
record our top tornado windspeed, 1
get that simply marvelous chapeau, 1
gala and it 's not, 1
'll prove to twilight that, 1
of harmony are the only, 1
sister but i 'm the, 1
went on the younger sister, 1
in the end the difference, 1
what they were getting into, 1
days as i did right, 1
attitude is so feisty it, 1
kind of welcome party would, 1
was an ursa minor then, 1
he 's supposed to be, 1
better of all of us, 1
i could n't answer your, 1
will rainbow dash make it, 1
were desperate for things to, 1
instead of beautiful it was, 1
why i would n't blame, 1
understand what a pet really, 1
that you would do something, 1
i mixed up a special, 1
what a real rodeo pony, 1
the crusading can wait until, 1

them to ensure there 's, 1
displaying is simply the result, 1
zis is not so for, 1
ask miss cheerilee to be, 1
away with my beautiful wings, 1
tough stain against one lame, 1
my best friends there with, 1
but it took me thome, 1
the hospital to finish the, 1
in all these neat events, 1
derby but that does n't, 1
thing to do and there, 1
doing here in the dark, 1
figured since we do this, 1
the mascarpone blended perfectly with, 1
fluttershy feels pretty stoked about, 1
when i say we could, 1
wake up every animal before, 1
n't you know better than, 1
being fake and totally insincere, 1
said i could handle this, 1
would be easy to nurse, 1
castle i simply must make, 1
choice you choose to pursue, 1
finish up the rest of, 1
when the five are present, 1
how could i possibly not, 1
entry of this year 's, 1
let you put on your, 1
nopony else has the guts, 1
whole gallery if you ca, 1

of the marzipan combined with, 1
going to do what i, 1
need to keep them apart, 1
granny is n't there a, 1

little more and you count, 1
a new unicorn in town, 1
i borrow this to show, 1
crowd of ponies who will, 1
watched that boring butterfly migration, 1
the cutie pox disappears as, 1
n't such a little tree, 1
we need to stick together, 1
symbolized my hope that i, 1
disaster is to stop time, 1
never said they were in, 1
" nice catch " in, 1
detail woulda save us from, 1
so i set out to, 1
but how did you escape, 1

i came to ponyville for, 1
now apple bloom do not, 1
like a tank i 'm, 1
we think you 're really, 1
all owe our cutie marks, 1
your wedding planning to notice, 1

all eyes would be on, 1
the powers of harmony upon, 1

indecision all we really like, 1
but if you 're so, 1
i have n't been replaced, 1
you girls would n't mind, 1
are being a jealous numskull, 1
trying to distract us from, 1
up on all those fancy-schmancy, 1
pox are clearing right up, 1
to help me stand guard, 1
i understand why you want, 1
fabulous to model for me, 1
you ca n't be such, 1

more and you count to, 1
then you 've got ta, 1
run out before you get, 1
rainbow dash just tripped me, 1
good little foals to take, 1
powdered donut 'cause that sounds, 1
i 'd have time to, 1
have to stop the wild, 1
of goods to gather before, 1
crop o' apples i ever, 1
new home and unpack my, 1
maybe she would n't have, 1
and we look divine into, 1
pinkie 's tail 's a-twitching, 1
it 's not a curse, 1
great and powerful trixie you, 1
not much we can do, 1
more like a performance and, 1
you just got ta move, 1
overnight and we were getting, 1
is a crime against fashion, 1
do something we like to, 1
of an apple or maybe, 1
be a zombie next year, 1
's just another sign that, 1
you sure you can handle, 1
touched my things without permission, 1
did you meet miss jubilee, 1
smiles represented the cheer i, 1
and i guess i should, 1
here and here and perfect, 1
your treats be given first, 1
great job fluttershy that was, 1
your " spring has sprung, 1
book for a little while, 1
dash will have a story, 1
in time for her birthday, 1
is mashed up cherries in, 1
but you do not i, 1
we need to find a, 1
the best teacher in the, 1
crews to retrieve the birds, 1
out the only reason they, 1
great time with my friends, 1
i give you the extra, 1
not " flip out ", 1
everypony grew the worse the, 1
have n't seen you in, 1
saw her compete at the, 1
you did n't need me, 1
drink down every little drop, 1
pretty much all you can, 1
what to do with that, 1
i know just who 's, 1
her awesome magic vanquished the, 1
hate the elements of harmony, 1
and look for a cure, 1
oh i 'm the one, 1
whoever produces the most barrels, 1
and what would i pack, 1
they 'll shower us with, 1
i know what they all, 1
me this will be the, 1
reckon we really do represent, 1
fortunetelling has nothing to do, 1
take it family appreciation day, 1
important conjurer of the pre-classical, 1
'm uh ah- no- sure, 1
will be makin' up some, 1
informing me that it is, 1
of nonsense-spoutin' nincompoops we may, 1
would mean even more to, 1
she just 'love-love-loved' your hors, 1
dawn the younger brought out, 1
who could have done that, 1
lesson to be learned here, 1
in equestria and it 's, 1
only reason they wanted to, 1
she must really think we, 1
the dragon has departed our, 1
guys have got ta get, 1
promise not to hurt you, 1
how happy i am to, 1
columns we 'll earn our, 1

thread by thread stitching it, 1
which as horrible as it, 1
n't twilight use her magic, 1
left to beat me to, 1
we decree that nightmare night, 1
okay if i hold you, 1
rainbow gets to have her, 1
i just thought that if, 1
've got ta at least, 1
be able to get him, 1
on the history of ponyville, 1
just eat it instead of, 1
across the finish line with, 1
no i 'm listening i, 1
yes i 'm pretty sure, 1
moon who makes you wary, 1
i think we deserve a, 1
when you decide not to, 1

now we wan na avoid, 1
save that falling baby bird, 1
it is true i have, 1
cutie mark crusaders will handle, 1

such a crime against fabulosity, 1
rabbit will disappear and something, 1
the stewards of the weather, 1

kicked out of any flight, 1
never run a race before, 1

you are my very best, 1
and oats why be at, 1
your number one assistant is, 1

if we ca n't buck, 1
was a little pony so, 1
sing for this crowd listen, 1
few other ponies had the, 1
apple acres out of business, 1
in canterlot i asked pinkie, 1

the disaster if we do, 1
i showed it off everyone, 1
that made you act super-duper, 1

do you know you are, 1
're all outstanding competitors but, 1
that bore this kind of, 1
okay rainbow dash you 've, 1
i think we can fix, 1
ca n't be that bad, 1
the cure but one must, 1
telescope apples bananas fruit punch, 1
that 's how you sell, 1
i was thrilled you were, 1
are doing a great job, 1
you make friends like the, 1
what that pony is wearing, 1
set a new record but, 1
might be over-watering my petunias, 1
would you wan na stop, 1
we 've been wishing for, 1
spike honestly you 're overreact, 1
papers and stacking them neatly, 1
go home empty-hooved after promising, 1
is so feisty it 's, 1
gon na spend the next, 1
that very special somepony for, 1
for a hog-sized surprise when, 1
" mayor not naturally gray, 1
i 've never been near, 1
you carrying a humongous boulder, 1
and the animals ' weird, 1
'm supposed to get the, 1
and no that 's not, 1
to ever pull it off, 1
cut a rug and when, 1
next item of fun we, 1
in a kumquat orchard just, 1
seem to have so little, 1
studies of pony magic have, 1
was destroyed by another baker, 1
to help you shine across, 1
take that mare do well, 1
applejack why do you have, 1
you ready to put your, 1
they 've got any more, 1
why do n't you tell, 1
apple bloom you 're **26;167;toolong, 1
just plain gettin' on my, 1
you and big mac would, 1
like to get a look, 1
too but rainbows do n't, 1
whatever anypony dares you to, 1
honorary family members allowed to, 1
way i 'm going to, 1
so you would n't have, 1
you could use some obedience, 1
carry on aimlessly wandering this, 1
writer i 've already penned, 1
's pinkie pie and rarity, 1
way i feel right now, 1
then i said " oatmeal, 1
i 'll come find ya, 1
one teensy thing to remember, 1
sure looks good on ya, 1
applejack to play dress up, 1
i thought you appreciated a, 1
our cider speaks for itself, 1
out bumping into fancy pants, 1
sounds to me like an, 1
if i had a mustache, 1
anything did n't work either, 1
of a doozy it was, 1
he is going to turn, 1
that ancient ruin could be, 1
bridesmaids because she found out, 1
bet big macintosh i could, 1
all so much for coming, 1
i 'll be back as, 1
to do was ask me, 1
the disaster could happen at, 1
i say how did you, 1
we planted our first orchards, 1
i really do have to, 1
and zombies which are as, 1
to lose friends and feel, 1
get us wingless ponies into, 1
fluttershy to be a doormat, 1
when twilight discovers it shredded, 1
you but i 'm afraid, 1
that spike 18 seconds 18, 1
's the dragon of the, 1
n't mind why ca n't, 1
we can return her to, 1
the one who 's lucky, 1

her extra ticket to the, 1
i just wanted to do, 1
a cutie mark in fancy, 1
what she was born with, 1
sure you know i 'll, 1
i wanted you to be, 1
maybe i could get my, 1
apples so i took the, 1
less silly way to get, 1
gabby gums made that up, 1
today i learned what the, 1
sapphire shores prepare yourself for, 1
gets to press on time, 1
everyone was turning on you, 1

's a skill you 're, 1

my flight crews to retrieve, 1
i guess you feared your, 1
bunch of gossip and rumors, 1

thought 'petty' was what you, 1
come fast out of the, 1

on the grass did you, 1
bring home the title of, 1
sorry but i 've made, 1

chance to earn our cutie, 1
but now that you have, 1
*was* starting to get just, 1
of ponies right here in, 1
know you could burn juice, 1
it 's because with me, 1
down here this instant young, 1

can get you a cutie, 1
all the pieces in the, 1
for the apple family all, 1
them one at a time, 1
spike is away in canterlot, 1

though she 's more concerned, 1
we would n't have had, 1
no wonder nopony wants my, 1
day of your new life, 1

fabrics for the shop but, 1
gives a flying feather about, 1
gums column is so funny, 1

the dragon will be like, 1
smoke and mirrors meant to, 1
where 'd you get all, 1
zap apples ' special harvesting, 1
take your loop-de-hoop into the, 1
she 's more concerned with, 1
the animals see these delicious, 1
to myself and would really, 1
apples like pink polka dots, 1
would very much appreciate it, 1
your hint but rarity is, 1
need to go when i, 1
that 's exactly what i, 1
dear twilight i am sure, 1
from the most delightful party, 1
it 's okay for y'all, 1

enter the next rodeo when, 1
now on i 'm gon, 1
the headdress need more feathers, 1
how i get roped into, 1
silky sweetness of the meringue, 1

greatest foalsitter in all the, 1
in the hay is that, 1
the labyrinth before we could, 1
season and i had this, 1
ignorant as to challenge the, 1
centered that 's critical and, 1
after being gone for a, 1
minute and lame the next, 1
a wish and blow out, 1
things did n't work not, 1
to our farm from far, 1
into the cool blue sky, 1
and of course pinkie and, 1

last forever 'cause you have, 1
because you dislike my style, 1
okay fluttershy you grab rainbow, 1
