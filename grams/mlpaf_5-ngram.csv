they seem to intuit their, 1
doubt they feel empty and, 1
if you have the right, 1
be tougher than i thought, 1
to search a little okay, 1
destroy him with chopped nuts, 1
cheer me up is a, 1
may decide what is and, 1
go and give them back, 1
too far for me to, 1

but i believe i can, 1
some more nectar your your, 1
you expect from them my, 1
you must let us out, 1

to sleep in a floating, 1
lofty go get checkers okay, 1
maybe if you believe in, 1
long to return to my, 1
way we 're sure to, 1
faster than you 've ever, 1
her being only a puppy, 1
i. the bushwoolies have stopped, 1
for your loveliness if woven, 1
look in the book of, 1
your pa most would be, 1
of fact you 're surrounded, 1
you and your friends ca, 1
fade forever it 's terrible, 1
but the only way i, 1
why should w-w-we have to, 1
though i seem to have, 1
is this the sort of, 1
to rely on galaxy 's, 1
maybe so but the only, 1
getting to the moochick and, 1
recipe for polish made from, 1
the magic coins in ponyland, 1
i was just a lad, 1
we 'll have a family, 1
any bigger cupcake but you, 1
lava demons have always been, 1
of course we scree only, 1
i 'll talk to bumble, 1
more puttin' up with this, 1
sunstone we wo n't have, 1
tirrac 's going to force, 1
we have all the horseshoes, 1
of the lava demons our, 1
my friends are just gon, 1
're witches that 's how, 1
it would take too long, 1
wonder if squirk 's found, 1
believe it 's a fire, 1
like we 've been running, 1
've got to find bray, 1
that 's what we look, 1
the crescent fell from the, 1
to tell you that they, 1
put a piece of black, 1
was forced to come here, 1
these boys caused so much, 1
we 've got you surrounded, 1
soon other creatures came to, 1
must have been filled with, 1
we could do it like, 1
it 's never over 'till, 1
the one who gave us, 1
i hope you 're satisfied, 1
the sunstone and you right, 1
prize roses but i 'm, 1
'cause they will be turned, 1
have to find a new, 1
i just said that you, 1
only a puppy i guess, 1
so i order a hole, 1
do n't want to drown, 1
simply just got to set, 1
do n't have many friends, 1
are the caretakers of the, 1
sorry i ca n't accompany, 1
we 're back in business, 1
ought a show those newborn, 1
was a tyrant all right, 1
you there in time it, 1
to wait a few minutes, 1
is the place where we, 1
ruff knew squirk could never, 1
megan 'll be here any, 1
creates a wind so cold, 1
shake hands and be friends, 1
baby ribbon means is that, 1
it 's the throne room, 1
poor darlings and the flories, 1
troggles that anyone not found, 1
the forest might not have, 1
we 're okay we 're, 1
we look we 'll see, 1
i can hardly do otherwise, 1
to appreciate the beauty in, 1
our wands in the crowns, 1
i can feel my powers, 1
it 's just a bit, 1
my back as i leave, 1
to that bell in time, 1
booby traps into this castle, 1
never been this close before, 1
on behalf of all the, 1
on her way we 'd, 1
anymore and i demanded that, 1
a spell that put her, 1
know a place filled with, 1
easy for you to say, 1
the power of his magical, 1
second there i thought my, 1
if they give us cupcakes, 1
ponies to help us help, 1
ability to appreciate the beauty, 1
we could n't have gotten, 1
can hardly do otherwise megan, 1
i 'm sure he will, 1
just shoved that ol' witch, 1
n't even see my feet, 1
are plenty of other witches, 1
is figure out a way, 1
going to be mad at, 1
which is the magical gem, 1
what a marvelous old antique, 1
maybe one part changed faster, 1
going to destroy us all, 1
i knew you would n't, 1
they chase us from every, 1
valley is going to wilt, 1
used up his energy the, 1
from the bucket into the, 1
come on garth cheer up, 1

give these wretched ponies a, 1
wink back in this minute, 1
where 's your grandfather now, 1

sun will shine on you, 1
in the satchel he was, 1
all we had was vanilla, 1
now nothing bad will happen, 1
confused 'bout you that 's, 1
a little visit is in, 1
mother could do to make, 1
like if the stonebacks were, 1
where else can we go, 1
the magic has been put, 1
pretend to be my friend, 1
of real magic little ponies, 1
i thought i had it, 1

the right track after all, 1

salt has a corrosive effect, 1
we left you in furbobia, 1
how much longer till flutter, 1

'll start making some really, 1
did this so only the, 1
rocky ripple you 're finished, 1
camp is all very well, 1
that we can judge how, 1
i could predict north star, 1
all this trouble 'cause only, 1
until flutter valley rots hydia, 1
you considered going back where, 1
'd be " it ", 1
bring forth those golden rays, 1
shadows were in the satchel, 1
expect more where that came, 1

of masquerade where is she, 1
not nearly as charming as, 1
is n't working right anywhere, 1
ca n't splash me you, 1

elevated eminence or is it, 1
which way leads to dream, 1
so he 's a little, 1
fourth let its wearer float, 1
but this can of magic, 1
it with the baby ponies, 1

the telepathic power of the, 1
that he needs us to, 1
stop believing it it 'll, 1
do declare friends may have, 1
n't you talk to her, 1
we 're the ones who, 1
the citizens of a nearby, 1

to get any bigger cupcake, 1
to my father the king, 1
ma'am they ruin the soil, 1
dumb guards stop us from, 1

and there is n't any, 1
one flick of my magic, 1
what red ball would be, 1

like it affects just the, 1
the rainbow is not such, 1

what you would do for, 1
she 'd kick me out, 1
power of light so that, 1
coulda' known that football is, 1
we never did decide who, 1
be sure they get good, 1
lava rock from the roiling, 1
habbit and i will look, 1
all into glass and then, 1
being crowded out of the, 1
only you could break your, 1
on it 's almost midnight, 1
shoop-shoop-bee-doo wan na play with, 1
north star i hope you, 1
dear me i know it, 1
it normally comes from north, 1
long before you ponies lived, 1
find that mean old ghost, 1
teach him a lesson he, 1
you can make hydia proud, 1
seems to be the source, 1
just use them against each, 1
do n't mess with me, 1
oh sonny where can i, 1
the coin glowed and dematerialized, 1
'm not only useless but, 1
n't do this to me, 1
do n't get stuck either, 1
to begin a long journey, 1
uh i think bumbleland 's, 1
bad luck down on yourself, 1
ca n't say i blame, 1
to get the bull back, 1
well if gluda and gock, 1
leave before you start hating, 1
do we do with the, 1
both of you is thinkin', 1
ponies are not our friends, 1
useless but i 'm a, 1
the symbol engraved on each, 1
it 's because of the, 1
were placed on the hooves, 1
frazzits remain in the barrel, 1
i just wished for a, 1
ponies and i will lead, 1
a lot of us ca, 1
on we can catch that, 1
for youe and it 'll, 1
i should have stayed to, 1
recourse is to make a, 1
i are going in the, 1
do n't go away mad, 1
's house is not far, 1
and lava demons can never, 1
like we could help her, 1
a new kingdom for us, 1
'll call you dinah then, 1
why not stay with bushwoolies, 1
to but it would take, 1
shoop-shoop-bee-doo hi have you seen, 1
because of you the little, 1
i wonder how mimic is, 1
already done the only thing, 1
thinks he 's figured out, 1
creating a cold ferocious beast, 1
pony shadow was n't enough, 1
moochick and the baby ponies, 1
's easy i 'll be, 1
sorry for you and tried, 1
and there was this coin, 1
work is truly magnificent oh, 1
c-c-cold where i live edgar, 1
it we ask it to, 1
will be coming over at, 1
think we ought a help, 1
truly all of ponyland is, 1
eaten anything in three days, 1
maybe i could have helped, 1
this floating castle faster if, 1
foretold that fleetfoot would win, 1
'll have the neatest gadget, 1
from flutter valley and grow, 1
i do n't know gusty, 1
our home 's okay now, 1
ruins of the city of, 1
but master there is n't, 1
the unicorns wink in and, 1
's wed attracts misadventure the, 1
to look in the book, 1
oh i forgot to tell, 1
ponies so there are probably, 1
would 've become a disaster, 1
put them out of it, 1
the dark for all eternity, 1
ruler grogar tried to conquer, 1
makes me feel a lot, 1
the frazzits into the barrel, 1
if we do n't know, 1
happened to the flutter ponies, 1
belongs to niblick only he, 1
are we 'll figure out, 1
longer until flutter valley rots, 1
we may need some help, 1
true your small black cloud, 1
escape and get some help, 1
much trouble my father made, 1
and i 'm not hiding, 1
are you interrupting me when, 1
furbobs never agree on anything, 1
's get the other ponies, 1
hair must be absolutely squeaky, 1
maybe we can blow down, 1
but i 'm sure they, 1
even big brothers like they, 1
yeah that 's it wind, 1
that 's fine with me, 1
the wind left her at, 1
'sposed to make people happy, 1
is not t-t-tasty good food, 1
paradise estate would 've become, 1
n't make it to paradise, 1
now it 's all ours, 1
his feelings from the heartstone, 1
ta be water some place, 1
of course not master right, 1

and i are the only, 1
wind so cold that soon, 1
you move the soup from, 1
a seed it 's hard, 1

you 're trying to say, 1
the princess ponies and their, 1
i should be in charge, 1
if it a ghost it, 1
gone on a trip or, 1
ca n't help but feel, 1
order a hole to be, 1
saving this for a special, 1
she was separated from them, 1
well there 's still time, 1

with help you 'll be, 1
back to flutter valley by, 1
they 're stealing our sunstone, 1
's what i call teamwork, 1

" long ago in the, 1
the bravest knight of all, 1
worst thing i ever heard, 1
got a surprise for you, 1
erebus had done i refused, 1
now lower it i say, 1
play in a village called, 1
for anyone to come visiting, 1
away from these mountains again, 1
that 's the worst special, 1
ca n't remember exactly what, 1
went back to paradise estate, 1
's no water there either, 1
who cleaned up a whole, 1
the toot-sweet little ponies are, 1
in the name of his, 1
it 's me your bumbleness, 1
they are very orderly and, 1
they manage to escape and, 1
there i 'm sure of, 1
then your job is just, 1
n't my imagination or a, 1
glory and keeping you in, 1
tell you the witches have, 1
wind left her at dawn, 1
i just do n't see, 1
are prisoners and resistance is, 1
back before sunset or flutter, 1
troggles do n't like tumbleweeds, 1
where will we keep her, 1
pleasure to meet all of, 1
beauty and love with its, 1
get megan and the rainbow, 1
you will if ya know, 1
exactly what i 'll do, 1
i 'm playing a game, 1
some woolie pies for you, 1
and his pony friend are, 1
only gets in the way, 1
can restore it with this, 1
let them go and give, 1
mind for some time now, 1
my imagination or a dream, 1
ahh somebody 's got to, 1
just wink over there and, 1
unless the child surrenders it, 1
i want to be alone, 1
la de da de dae, 1
is too small to pull, 1
she did n't mean to, 1
pony hair once it 's, 1
little dust would n't have, 1
back flutter ponies and you, 1
have to leave ya but, 1
valley will be just the, 1
still get the sunstone back, 1
you think they could have, 1
one more jaunt to the, 1
and now i 'm sure, 1
us out of here right, 1
his way to his trailer, 1
if she was a big, 1
that you have to come, 1
too bad you were n't, 1
come from grayvale a place, 1
and the crab nasties so, 1
we talk for a minute, 1
when they were winking in, 1
better not hurt baby moondancer, 1
he does n't look very, 1
just lend us these two, 1
a lifetime for this sting, 1
just a teensy bit guilty, 1
different roles in the land, 1
me turn this barrel over, 1
too hot for anyone to, 1
then there only one thing, 1
you out of there in, 1
it 's a huge ruby, 1
can also get to the, 1
did n't capture all those, 1
just happy that the toot-sweet, 1
the grundles that are left, 1
shadow which would end my, 1
away from lavan and his, 1
longed to find one so, 1
it will not be difficult, 1
can be used for evil, 1
you were at the dungeon, 1
to undo the wishes of, 1
'll find it yes yes, 1
with the magic wands once, 1
person who can help us, 1
hydia do n't you remember, 1
're speaking of the big, 1
into the land of legends, 1
do you promise to undo, 1
sorry the accommodations are unpleasant, 1
home and tell the great, 1
if we approach from different, 1
has n't eaten anything in, 1
n't any of you noticed, 1
and and that 's my, 1
we ought a help knight, 1
just confused 'bout you that, 1
go away do n't bother, 1
sure wish i could wink, 1
lunch so she winked out, 1
would be better to separate, 1

moochick mimic is sick and, 1
still think i should be, 1
you 're standing on my, 1
oh you poor tragic thing, 1

oh i get it now, 1
cloak so my world will, 1
we 'll have the neatest, 1
had done i refused to, 1
to grant you three wishes, 1
we 're your friends and, 1
kept going when things were, 1
darlings and the flories gone, 1
lava demons and the ice, 1
the scree gaze upon one, 1
well uh it--it looks like, 1
that used to be our, 1
all this water makes me, 1
puppy i guess we ca, 1
to ask you that is, 1
the magic wands once we, 1
oh me maybe somebody else, 1
wings are heavy from the, 1
wo n't be tickled again, 1
live up to it too, 1
creatures came to live here, 1
you rather be up there, 1
's magnifier and get him, 1

i 'll hide in the, 1
'll find a way in, 1
who could imagine we 'd, 1
i 'll see you at, 1
the baby ponies ' shadows, 1
's where we 've got, 1
of the coins starting with, 1
what 're we gon na, 1

wan na leave my buggy, 1
his energy the smaller he, 1
this had better work reeka, 1
wherein she sleeps kiss and, 1
is causing all the problems, 1
some bad things in this, 1
into a crystal beam of, 1
it sounds louder over here, 1
this is the right way, 1
know the prevailing wind speed, 1
if we ca n't find, 1
'd only get thrown out, 1
i just ca n't wait, 1
we ca n't thank you, 1
this is megan she has, 1
or put out the salamander, 1
complete the work of replacing, 1
just whap it with your, 1
i guess it 's like, 1
all safe posey but awfully, 1
the troggles enjoy living in, 1
those puny little ponies purple, 1
seem to recall an ancient, 1
in ponyland either and we, 1
so that 's what we, 1
take any to the baby, 1
think he is around here, 1
clouds have me worried buttons--'cause, 1
up a long time ago, 1
the rest of you wait, 1

was thinking that when you, 1
immobilized them all with his, 1
causing all these strange happenings, 1
or disappear like you can, 1
do n't suppose everyone can, 1
he must have known of, 1
do the dance of the, 1
very happy to see us, 1

to find your way through, 1
and he 'll fold up, 1
all of you do everything, 1
it 's actually pretty simple, 1
could go with you because, 1
then we 'll just go, 1
behalf of all the little, 1

anything with the stone in, 1

for you to swim under, 1

for pretending to be a, 1
of their shadows being an, 1

to stop believing such crazy, 1

i think truly and the, 1
the problem is getting through, 1
we fell into the dell, 1
'd read their minds if, 1
my parents a while ago, 1
in the crowns and then, 1
these ponies here these living, 1

we 're off the crimson, 1
'd better be moving on, 1
just like you 'll always, 1
the last year we do, 1
for the double inside-out loop, 1
it would be all right, 1
that those pathetic creatures caused, 1
hope they can rescue the, 1
heartstone which is the magical, 1
he 's made our lives, 1
i guess that cooled her, 1
do n't let me down, 1
i 'm spike a baby, 1

furbob and i have to, 1
from megan and the flutter, 1

what if we ca n't, 1
to your children could be, 1
'd just better go home, 1
try and save the other, 1
love 'em any more than, 1
decide what is and is, 1
we 're still being followed, 1
up grogar we 've got, 1
do n't need much water, 1
and hyper super-duper technical things, 1
na thaw things out we, 1
flutter valley and grow all, 1

so you seek the rainbow, 1
there you can go as, 1
with energy that gave him, 1
n't tell her friends what, 1
why do n't you talk, 1
do n't have a fit, 1
it matter to you where, 1
you 're breaking my heart, 1
need not be dreary if, 1
on our roots in no, 1
bull bet you ca n't, 1
want to spoil the game, 1
thinking it over and she, 1

which ai n't gon na, 1
's the signal shell that, 1
no place to put a, 1
come on snookums baby lickety-split, 1
poor wind whistler she looks, 1
in the meantime we can, 1
filled with colorful flowers and, 1
such a good flier already, 1
heroes and i 'm always, 1
stone statues all the way, 1
i think they want more, 1
out of their natural habitat, 1

i 'll check it out, 1
baby lickety-split we 're out, 1
'em to satin slipper sweet, 1
and make it bubble it, 1
here is the right place, 1

an all-out ice cream war, 1
inhabitant of ponyland in the, 1
no i 'll just hold, 1

' shadows were in the, 1
'll always be remembered as, 1
of darkness a sort of, 1
two more minds right over, 1
princess ponies do n't know, 1
the roiling depths of the, 1
south for the w-winter and, 1
just forget where it is, 1
i think it 's because, 1
all the way back in, 1
ca n't talk like us, 1
now you stop that right, 1
ponyland needs rain before it, 1
keep her out of trouble, 1

a singular lack of inspiration, 1
there 's nothing better than, 1

maybe it 's time you, 1
where he ca n't see, 1
the princess ponies to learn, 1
this is where we met, 1
he 's trying to change, 1
say we break it down, 1

right in ponyland again and, 1
mr. mayor you must let, 1
ask but what are you, 1

your mirrored world not take, 1
the sunstone must be retrieved, 1
live below the forest floor, 1

and has long hair only, 1
he promoted in bright valley, 1
blue your royal blue or, 1

to flutter valley before sunset, 1
watcher of the crescent of, 1
since the rainbow froze over, 1
n't stay here morning glory, 1

longer paradise estate would 've, 1
cuddles will be as good, 1
our children 's shadows too, 1

to spoil the game for, 1
going in the back to, 1

i 'll reconnoiter and ascertain, 1
in worse shape than before, 1
can feel the power within, 1
all is not good enough, 1
she hates me she hates, 1
maybe she winked back somewhere, 1
not half so good as, 1
