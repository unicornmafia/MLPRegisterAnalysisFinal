La, la la, la la, la la, la la. Thank you little squirrel, but remember: these flowers are for Princess Celestia. Only the prettiest ones will do. La, la la, la la, la la, la la.
Gah!
Hello, little guy. I've never seen anything like you before.
Oh, are you hungry? Here you go.  I guess you were hungry.
You're the cutest thing ever! I can't wait to show you to my friends.
Oh! Hurry up, Spike! This place isn't gonna clean itself.
It also didn't mess itself up.
Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!
I thought this was just an unofficial casual visit.
There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty. I want this place to be spotless, and you've barely made a dent in the clutter.
Maybe you should, ugh, start reading them one at a time-- whoa ho! Aw.
Everything's got to be perfect. No time for fooling around.
You know, this would be an awful lot easier if there weren't two of us here getting under each other's feet.
Great idea. You clean, I'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming.
Or maybe I should... 
What happened to the rest of her name?
We couldn't fit it all in.
You can't hang a banner that says "Welcome Princess Celest". Take it down and try again.
That looks perfect. Keep up the good work.
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. How's the banquet coming?
Uh...it would be coming a little better if...
Mmm... 
Pinkie! What are you doing? Those sweets are supposed to be for the princess.
I know. That's why I'm tasting them. Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue, and I, Pinkie Pie, declare that these treats are fit for a king, or a queen, or a princess.
Twilight, Pinkie, you won't believe... oh, I'm sorry. Uh, am I interrupting?
No, not at all. Come on in and make yourself at home.  What's going on, Fluttershy?
You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest. Come on out, little guy. It's okay.
 Three?
They're amazing. What are they?
I'm not sure. I'm also not sure where these other two came from.
I'll take one off your hooves. I've never seen anything so... adorable. Besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for Spike so he won't bother me so much while I'm studying.
Pinkie, do you want the other one?
Ugh! A parasprite? Are you kidding?
Ugh?
A para-what?
How could you not like...
Ugh. Now I gotta go find a trombone.
A what?
A trombone, you know: 
Ahhh, typical Pinkie.
Stand still, Rainbow Dash.
Ugh, I caaan't, I need to flyyy! This is waaay too boring for me.
Do you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not?
Wow. Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous.
Mmhmm. Thank you, Twilight. Nice to know someone appreciates my talents.
Ugh, sooo boooring.
Huh?
What's that sound, Twilight?
Wow, what are they?
The better question is, where did they come from? I only had one a minute ago.
Uh, I'll take one.
Me too, oh, they're perfect.
Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?
Girls! Hello! This is important. Durgh! Thanks a lot.
 The decorations, the banquet, I really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow.
Oh,  what's there to worry about?
Spike! Wake up! What happened?
Huh? Whaaa! What's going on?
Where did they come from?
I don't know. The little guy got hungry in the night, so I gave him a snack, but... I have no idea where these others came from. Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work!
The princess will be here in a few hours.
Ugh.
Spike, help me round up these little guys.
Ugh, what does it look like I'm doin'? Ooow, waaah! D'oh. I know, I know, "stop fooling around".
Huh? Huh?!  Waaa!
Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful.
Oh! Are you okay? Aaah!  Eewww. Aaah! Gross gross gross! No creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique!
Look Rarity, Applejack loaned me a harmonica.  Isn't that great?
 And not a moment too soon.
Ugh, Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now.
And I'm not? You know how many more instruments I've gotta find? A lot, that's how many. Now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time.
Please, Pinkie, I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt. I've got a real problem.
You've got a real problem, all right. And a banjo is the only answer!
 I see we're having the same problem.
Ditto!
Fluttershy knows everything about animals, I'm sure she can tell us how to stop them from multiplying.
...or not.
Ugh, do something Fluttershy, can't you control them?
I've tried everything I know: I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely and...
Guh.
If we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster.
Ew! If you ask me, it's already a total disaster.
Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy, but I still can't figure why y'need so many. Hey!
What do we do?
 I got it! Nopony can herd like Applejack.
Yeah! We can drive 'em back into the forest.
 I'll rastle 'em up, but I need everypony's help to do it. Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there. I'll herd the little critters straight at ya like a funnel. Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy stay on top of 'em, don't let 'em fly away.
Aye aye.
Yeeeeeee-haw!
Alright y'all, here goes nothin'. Look out Rarity, that one's fixin' to get away. Keep a lead on 'em, Rainbow Dash! Hold on girls, we're almost there.
Pinkie!
Twilight, we don't have much time.
You're telling me. The princess could arrive at any moment.
Exactly. That's why I need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some maracas.
Maracas? Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas.
 You're right! Getting a tuba has to be our number one goal. Follow me. I said, follow me!
Pinkie Pie, you are so random.
And you are all so stubborn!
Forget her ladies. Focus. Head 'em up and move 'em out.
All right! 
Ouch.
We did it. Nice work, Applejack.
Couldn't a'done it without y'all.
Now let's get back and clean up the mess they made before the princess arrives.
Okay, everyone knows what to do, right? We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time.
Where did they come from?
Well, I may have kept just one. Heh. I couldn't help myself. They're just so cute.
We don't have time to keep rounding up these things. What do we do now?
We call in the weather patrol. 
Time to take out the adorable trash. YAAAAAA!
 Way to go, Rainbow Dash!
Looks like our problems are solved.
They will be with these cymbals.  Hey! Give me those back!
Whoa. Yaa! Yow! Whoa! Wow! I can't hold it! She's breaking up.
Pinkie Pie, what have you done?
I've lost a brand new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done.
Will you forget about your silly instruments for one second? You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville.
Me? Ruin? I'm not the ruiner, I'm the ruin-ee! Or is it ruiness? Ruinette?
Come on girls, there's no reasoning with that one. She's a few apples short of a bushel.
Hey! I'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof. If you'd just slow down and listen to me!
Aah!
What do we do? They're eating all the food in town.
 My apples!
We've gotta do something.  I got it! I'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food.
Look, tambourines! If you could all just... 
Heh. Hey, it worked. They're not eating the food anymore.
Oh no... if they get inside my store... Everypony for herself!
My outfits! Go on, shoo! Get out of here, you naughty! Naughty! 
I'll save you!
No woodland creature's gonna eat the Apple Family's crop.
Brace yourself, y'all, here they come.  Didn't see that one comin'.
Help!
Help...
Ugh. Have you gone mad?
Zecora, these little guys are devouring Ponyville, and the princess is on her way. Can you help us, please?
Oh, monster of so little size. Is that a parasprite before my eyes?
I don't know! Is it?
Tales of crops and harvests consumed. If these creatures are in Ponyville, you're doomed.
 Oh no, here she comes.
Aaaah, aaaaaaah!
Okay, here's the plan. Rainbow Dash, you distract them.
YAAAA!
Good. Everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of Ponyville right over there. We've got less than a minute. Zecora was right, we're doomed. Oh no, the princess's procession is here. It's all over!
Pinkie? We're in the middle of a crisis here. This is no time for your... nonsense?
Look.
Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil.
Hello, princess.
So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends.
So... how was the trip? Hit much traffic?
Ah, what is this? Oh ho ho, these creatures are adorable.
They're not that adorable.
I'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of Ponyville have organized a parade in honor of my visit.
Parade? Oh. Yes, the parade.
Unfortunately, that visit is going to have to wait for another time. I'm afraid an emergency has come up in Fillydelphia. Apparently there's been some sort of infestation.
An... infestation?
Yes, a swarm of incredibly bothersome creatures has invaded the poor town. I'm sorry Twilight, to have to put you all through so much trouble.
Trouble? What trouble?
Before I have to go, would you care to give me your latest report on the magic of friendship in person?
My... report?
Haven't you learned anything about friendship?
Actually, I have. I've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it. It's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives...
Even when they don't always seem to make sense.
I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle, and I'm very impressed with your friends as well. It sounds like you're all learning so much from each other.
Thank you, princess.
Hey, what happened to the princess?
Emergency in Fillydelphia.
Some sort of infestation.
Oh no! Have they got parasprites too? Well, have tuba, will travel.
I think the princess can handle it.
So you knew what those critters were all along, huh Pinkie Pie?
Well, duh! Why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments? I tried to tell you.
We know, Pinkie Pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen.
You're a great friend, even if we don't always understand you.
Thanks guys, you're all great friends too, even when I don't understand me.
You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia, and more importantly, you saved Ponyville.
...Or not.
Boy howdy! I got my work cut out for me. That there is the biggest bumper crop o' apples I ever laid eyes on.
Eeyup. Too big for you to handle on your own.
Come on, big brother! You need to rest up and get yourself better. I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't handle. Oops, sorry. I'll take a bite out of this job by day's end.
Biting off more than you can chew is just what I'm afraid of.
Are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep?
Eeyup.
Why of all the... This is your sister Applejack, remember? The loyalest of friends and the most dependable of ponies?
But still only one pony, and one pony plus hundreds o' apple trees just doesn't add up to...
Don't you use your fancy mathematics to muddy the issue! I said I could handle this harvest and I'm gonna prove it to you. I'm gonna get every last apple out of those trees this applebuck season all by myself. 
Well I better get kickin'. These apples aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees. Hey! Oh no.
STAMPEDE!
Stampede!
 This makes my voice sound silly!
Pinkie Pie, are you crazy?! Run!
Everypony calm down. There is no need to panic.
But Mayor, whatever shall we do?
Look there!
YEEHAW!
Move aside, Winona. Put 'em up, girl!
This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen. 
Come on, little dogies! Turn! 
Attagirl.  Yee haw!
Whoaaa. Hooie. Now what was that all about?
 Oh my! Begging your pardon, Applejack, but Mooriella here saw one of those nasty snakes.
And it just gave us all the willies, don'tcha know.
I completely understand. Just next time, try and steer clear of Ponyville.
We certainly will, Applejack. So long, Winona!
Yee haw!
Yee haw! Ride 'em, cowpony!
Applejack was just... just...
Appletastic!
Exactly. We must do something to thank Applejack for single-hoofedly saving the town.
I know.
A party!
We all ready?
Just one last thing. Now we're ready.
Is Applejack all set?
Actually, I haven't seen her all week.
Not since the stampede.
But she'll be here for sure. Applejack is never late.
Welcome, everypony! Today we are here to honor a pony we can always count on to help in matters great and small. A pony whose contributions to--
Did you see Applejack's slick moves out there? What an athlete. This week she's gonna help me with my new flying trick, and I know it's gonna be so awesome.
Exactly. And...
This week, I get to run Sugarcube Corner for the first time.
What does that have to do with Applejack?
Oh. Applejack, one of the best bakers ever, is gonna help me. Applejack makes everything great, so free samples for everypony!
Oh-kay, that's great. Now if I could just make a point without being inter--
Twilight?
--rupted.
Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also helping me this week with the official bunny census, where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season. She's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills.
Anyone else? Anyone? No? Well then, as I was trying to say... Urgh! Never mind.
Ah-ahem. And so, with no further ado, it is my privilege to give the prize, Pony of Ponyville Award, to our beloved guest of honor, a pony of the utmost trustworthiness, reliability, and integrity. Ponyville's most capable and dependable friend: Applejack!
Cool! Way to go Applejack, that was awesome! I mean-- heh.
Ah-ahem.
Awkward.
I'm here. I'm here.  It's so bright and shiny and, heh, heh heh, I sure do look funny heh. Ooo-ooo.
Woo-ooo.
Ooo-ooo.
Okay. Well, thank you Applejack for saving us from that scary stampede, and always being there for everypony.
 Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, Thanks.
Was it just me, or did Applejack seem a little--
Tired?
Dizzy?
Messy? Well, did you see her mane?
She seemed fine to me. Woo! Woo!
Hmm.
 O-oah.
What on Earth is that pony doing?
Whoops.
Hey Applejack!
Applejack.
Applejack. AppleJACK!
Oh, howdy, Twilight.
What is all this?
It's Applebuck season. Whoa.
Applewhat season?
Neh, It's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time. We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em.
But why are you doing it all alone?
'cause Big McIntosh hurt himself.
What about all those relatives I've met when I first came to Ponyville? Can't they help?
 They were just here for the Apple family reunion. They actually live all over Equestria and are busy harvestin' their own orchards. So, uh, I'm on my own. Which means, I should really get back to work. Ahem... hint hint? Get back to work?
Fine.
Could you step aside, Twilight?
I just did. Applejack, you don't look so good.
Eh, don't any of you three worry none, I'm just fine and dandy. Whoa.
Do you... want some help?
Help? No way, no how.
But there's no way you can do it all on your own.
Is that a challenge?
Uhm... no?
Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it! Now if you'll excuse me, I've got apples to buck.
There you are.
 I'm a mite sorry, Rainbow. I was busy applebuckin' and I guess ah, I closed my eyes for a second and, when I woke up, I was late. Now, what's this new trick a' yours?
See this contraption?
Uh... Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then you're gonna jump down from that platform, launching me into the air faster than I can take off on my own. Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do some amazing flips and spins that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts.
Isn't that a mite dangerous?
Pfft, Heh, not for a pony who can fly.
Well, all right-y then. Oh my.
Ready? One... two... THREE!
Umm... maybe I wasn't clear. You're supposed to land on the other end.
Got it. 
Applejack, what the hay is going on? I mean, I thought I was working with Ponyville's best athlete!
You are. I'm okay. Really. I-I have an idea. Watch this.  Ta da! Oh... Maybe not. Okay, one more try. I'm sure to get it this time.
Ugh!
Heh heh... Here I go!
Wait, Applejaaaaack!
You're welcome!
Can I help you?
I think somepony else needs your help.
Applejack?
Yep.
Ow!
Applejack, can we talk? Applejack, can we talk?
Can bees squawk?! I don't think so.
No. Can we talk?
Twenty stalks? Bean or celery?
No! I need to talk to you.
You need to walk to the zoo? Well, who's stoppin' you?
I need to talk to you!
Oh! Well why didn't you say so? What you wanna talk about?
Rainbow Dash dropped in to see me today.
That's quite neighborly of her.
Yes, except that she crashed onto my balcony after you launched her into the air.
Oh, yeah. I wasn't feeling quite myself this morning.
Because you're working too hard and you need help.
What? Kelp? I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed.
HELP! You need HELP!
Nothin' doin', Twilight. I'm gonna prove to you, t'everypony, that I can do this on my own. Ow! Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie.
Ugh.
Now Pinkie Pie, are you sure you're up for baking the muffins and running the store this afternoon?
Yes siree bob, Mrs. Cake. Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out. Why, she's the best baker ever. Right, Applejack?
No? You're not the best baker ever?
WHAT? Oh no! I mean, don't you fret. I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye.
 All right. Well, see you later, girls!
Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'.
All right-y! I'll get the sugar and the eggs. Can you get me some chocolate chips?
Eh, uh, whu, what was that?
Chocolate chips.
Chips... got it. Tater chips, a little salty and dry, okie-dokie. What next?
Baking soda.
Soda. Perfect. That'll get the tater chips nice and wet. Now what?
A cup of flour.
A cup o' sour? Well, lemons are sure sour. One cup o' sour, comin' up. Anything else, Pinkie?
One last thing. Wheat germ.
Wheat worms? Oh, that must be fancy talk for earthworms.
Now that's gonna be delicious.
If you say so.
Free muffin sample spectacular!
Yeah! Muffin spectacles! Get 'em while they're hot.
We came as soon as we heard.
Oh thank you, Twilight. We need all the help we can get.
Oh no! What happened?
It was a mishap with some of the baked goods.
No, not baked goods, baked bads. 
Applejack.
 Want one?
Applejack, we need to talk.
Wha, huh? Oh, it's you, Twilight.  I know what you're gonna say, but the answer is still no.
Not to upset your applecart, but you need help.
Hardy har.  And no I don't.
Here, let me help.
Help? No thanks. .
AJ, think you're beating a dead... tree.
I knew that.
Actually, Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about. I just came back from Ponyville Urgent Care and--
You know, I'm a little busy to get lectured right now, Twilight.
But if you'd just let me help--
Ugh. No, no, NO! How many times do I gotta say it? I don't need no help from nopony!
Ugh. That pony is stubborn as a mule.
No offense.
None taken.
Oh Applejack! Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit roundup.
Ugh. Why are we doin' this?
Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born, so it's my job to get a count of all the new families.
Fine. Can we just get on with it?
Certainly, but remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows. They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently.
I do NOT need any direction on corrallin' critters. Right, Winona?
Okay, little bunnies! I need you to all gather here in the middle.
That's right! Let's go, bunnies. In the center. Hop to it. Swell. Just swell. Put 'em up, Winona!
Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them.
We know what we're doin'. Get along, little bunnies.
Oh no.
STAMPEDE!
 Stampede!
The horror, the horror.
It was awful.
A disaster. A horrible, horrible disaster.
I don't get it.
Our gardens, destroyed.
Every last flower, devoured.
By... by... THEM!
Oh my. Oh... Please stop, little bunnies. Oh no! Please, let's go home. Oh my goodness.
All right. Enough is enough.
Must  more. Must finish harvestin'.
All right, Applejack. Your applebucking hasn't just caused you problems, it's over-propelled Pegasus', practically poisoned plenty of ponies, and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies. I don't care what you say, you. Need. Help.
 Ha! No, I don't. Look, I did it. I harvested the entire Sweet Apple Acres without your help. How d'ya like them apples?
Um, how do you like them apples?
Applejack. Applejack.
Huh?
Oh, good, you're okay. Now Applejack, I completely respect the Apple family ways. You're always there to help anypony in need, so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside and allow your friends to help you.
Okay, Twilight.
I am not taking "no" for an answer--what?
Yes, Twilight. Yes, please. I could really use your help.
Dear Princess Celestia,
How about y'all take a little break? I got some fine apple juice waitin' for ya!  Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help. I was acting a bit stubborn.
A bit?
Okay. A mite stubborn, and I'm awful sorry. Now, I know the town gave me the Prized Pony award, but the real award is having you five as my friends.
Phew! That applebucking sure made me hungry.
And I've got the perfect treat.
Eeew... Spike, I threw those all away. Where'd you get them?
From the trash.
 EW!
Just a little nibble? Come on.
Ew! Gross!
No distractions. Today is too important. Re-shelving day! Understanding Medieval Equestria goes in Pony History. Modern Spellcasting. That's Classics. The Art of the To-Do List... Actually, I kinda wanna read that again.
Spike! What are you laughing at?
This little beauty is my birthday present to myself! It's a fire ruby! I've been aging it for months, and it's almost ripe!
 Hey, you took my advice! Just use the whole floor as one big shelf.
 Is that a fire ruby?! Huh, that must be at least twenty carats! No inclusions, pristine facets...
And totally delicious.
Uhh... if you guys don't mind?
Oh, uh, of course. I just came by to see if you had any books on historical fashion...  Did you say... delicious?
Sure did! Next week's my birthday, and this is my birthday dinner.
Start with this one.
Thanks, Twilight. I've got a feeling ruffled taffeta capes are going to make a huge comeback this season, and I want to be ahead of the game...  I hope it's as tasty as it is beautiful, Spike. I've never seen anything quite so stunning before.
Gosh... You really like it, huh?
Like it? It's magnificent.
 Then you should have it. This beautiful gem was meant to be with you.
I don't know what to say... This is so thoughtful. Oh, my little Spikey-wikey!  Thank you so much!
Wow, Spike, that's one of the kindest, most generous things you've ever done. I've never seen Rarity so happy!
I will never wash this cheek again. 
Just about finished, Spike? Everypony will be here soon.
There. Perfect! Everything looks perfect!
Not quite everything.
A washcloth? I don't get it. Ah, no way, Twilight! I said I wasn't gonna wash the cheek that Rarity kissed, and I meant it!
It's over, Spike! I'm cleaning that cheek!
 It's mine! Stop it!
Never!
Twilight...!
 Happy birthday!
Party time, woo-hoo!
Are those... for me?
You bet they are, birthday boy.
Happy birthday, Spike.
Don't you know you get presents on your birthday?
Well, actually, this is my first birthday in Ponyville... I usually just get one present... from Twilight. A book.
Speaking of presents, this is from my new line of taffeta capes. I'm going to make one for each of you!
I've been inspired by the generosity of my little Spikey-wikey, who gave me this beautiful fire ruby, one of the kindest acts I've ever experienced. Mmm.
Applejack, I can't thank you enough for this great blanket. I really needed a new one.
C'mon, Spike, you already thanked me fifteen times. I'm startin' to get a little embarrassed.
I know I keep thanking you guys, but I'm just so grateful. I wish this party could last forever.
Duh! The party can't last forever 'cause you have to go to Sugarcube Corner, 'cause the Cakes said they have a special surprise for you, 'cause it's your birthday!
No way!
I said the party couldn't last forever, but it doesn't need to end right now!
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Cake!
There's the dragon of the hour! Happy birthday, Spike!
Thanks!
When we found out it was your birthday, we couldn't resist trying out a new recipe: sapphire!
Wow!
Thank you so much! Man, first I get a bunch of great presents from my best friends, and now an amazing sapphire cupcake! Hohoh, what a day! Whoa! Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry, Cheerilee!
That's okay. What's got you so excited?
 Pinkie Pie told me I should come see the Cakes, so they could give me a cake 'cause it's my birthday today.
Well, happy birthday, Spike! I wish I had something to give you! Uh... Oh! Here you go!
Wow, really?
Sure! Everypony should get fun gifts on their birthday! Have a great birthday, Spike.
I wish every day was my birthday...
Pinkie Pie mentions my birthday to the Cakes, and I get a cupcake. I mention it to Cheerilee, and I get this great hat.
Hmmm, I wonder... Hey there, Lickety Split! That's a pretty cool ball you got there! Did you know it's my birthday?
 Hey, Junebug! It's my birthday!
Happy birthday, Spike.
Aren't you gonna give me something? You know, like a birthday present?
Um, I... I don't have anything.
Well, how about those flowers? I'll take those–
Spike! Uh, sorry, Junebug, I think Spike might've gotten a little carried away.
Uh, no problem... H-Happy birthday, Spike!
What are you doing? You're out here demanding gifts now?
Wow, you're right, Twilight. I don't know what got into me. Thanks for snapping me out of it. I'd better go give Cheerilee her hat back.
No problem. See you at home later?
Sounds good! Bye! 
Wow, what a rough night's sleep, Spike. I had the weirdest drea–
I can't believe you! Where'd you get all this– 
 What happened?
What's happening to me, Twilight?!
I don't know! Think back to last night. Did something happen? Spike? What did you do after I saw you?
I went to talk... to...
Spike!
Huh?
You went to talk to who?
Oh, um... I don't remember. Hey, can I have that globe? You're not using it, right?
Huh?
What about this book?
Spike, I'm worried about you. You're usually not so... grabby!
My arms aren't usually  this long either. What's happening to me?
Well now, what seems to be the problem?
This is Spike.  his!
All right then, let's just have a look see, shall we? Widdle guy not feewing too good? Who's a brave widdle boy, huh? Who's a brave one?
So? What do you think, Doctor?
Well, I think I know what the problem is. He's a dragon!
That's not the problem. He's always been a dragon.
Oh. Well, that would explain it. Listen, I don't know anything about dragons, I know about baby ponies. Maybe you should try a vet.
 Okay. Thank you, doctor.
Hm, well, I'm flummoxed. Y'bring me a dog, I've got it diagnosed in seconds. Snake even faster, but... to be honest, I've never seen a real live dragon before.
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Sit.
Thanks anyway. C'mon, Spike.
Ooh, he is starting to mature. Of this fact I am quite sure.
Mature? So he's just... growing up? But that doesn't explain why he keeps grabbing things.
A dragon's heart is prone to greed, a steady diet to make growth speed. Then, the resulting bigger size only makes their hunger rise. If this trait should go unchecked, if Spike continues to collect, more growth will certainly occur – he is going to turn into a monster.
 You mean the more things a dragon collects, the bigger and greedier he gets? But how do we stop him before he's completely out of control?
If his monstrous ways you wish to impede, you must prevent him from practicing greed.
Get away from her, you brute!
Spike want!
You're not getting my scooter!
Spike want!
Hey, Spike! Check out this amazing broom!
Spike want! 
 C'mon, big boy! Look at this incredible broom!
Spike want!
Fight all you want, I'm not letting you out! Oh, Spike, I just re-shelved this room!
 What now?
Now who in Ponyville would steal my apples? For that matter, who would steal my leaves?
Applejack, help! Spike's running wild and I need you to lasso him!
 Oh, that's a good one, Twilight. Sweet little Spike, running wild. Ha, what a laugh.
Twilight, get my rope.
Help!
Huh?  Don't tell me! You-you tied yourselves up?
Get us out of here right now!
 What was that?
Sounded like Fluttershy to me!
Fluttershy? Fluttershy!?
I'm up here!
What happened?
I was helping my squirrel friends with a dance step, and all of a sudden, a giant, r-rampaging d-d-d-dragon stormed through!
That was Spike!
Spike? But why would Spike steal my chicken coop? He just pulled it out of the ground and filled it with a bunch of apples and stuff!
That sounded like Pinkie Pie!
C'mon, girls!
Back! Get back!
Pinkie Pie! Stop giving him cake!
I'm not giving him cake, I'm assaulting him with cake!
How dare you take the cake!
He's completely out of control! Who knows where he'll go next!
Put me down, you brute!
How rude.
Don't worry Rarity, we'll save you!
Put her down, right now!
I-If you wouldn't mind, that is...
I mean it, dragon boy!
We'll be ever so grateful if you'd be so kind as to possibly consider...
Drop her, scaly!
Hey! I'm– not some– sort of common– fly swatter!
Girls! My cape!
Look! The Wonderbolts!
Oh, be quiet. You've got nothing to be proud of. You steal everypony's things, terrorize the town, and use me as a weapon against my own friends! Which, as horrible as it is, I can almost understand because you're a dragon and all. But this!  This is a crime against fashion! Oh no. You are not getting this gemstone! This was given to me by my dear friend Spikey-wikey, the kindest, sweetest, most generous dragon ever. And it is too precious to me to give to a greedy old beast like you!
(flashback): Here, Rarity, you take it. It would mean even more to see you happy than to eat it myself.
(flashback): I... I don't know what to say. This is just so generous. 
Oh, what now? I suppose you'll be eating me or something? Spike?! You're the rampaging dragon?!
Somepony do something!
On it!
Rarity? I need to tell you something! Just in case we don't make it! I've always sort of had a crush–
 We did it! I can't believe we did it!
All in a day's work.
Spike, I just have to tell you how absolutely proud I am of you.
Proud of me?
Yes. It was you who stopped... w-well, you, from destroying Ponyville. You are my hero, Spikey-wikey! 
Dear Princess Celestia,
We're getting closer!
I can hardly wait!
I'm so excited, I-I feel like shouting!  Woo-hoo!
Hooo-wee! Canterlot, here we come!
Oh, I do hope I look festive enough!
There it is! Canterlot!
Oooh...
Oh, isn't Canterlot wonderful this time of year?
Yeah, I wish it was Hearth's Warming Eve every day.
There's so much to look at! I feel like my durned eyes are gonna pop right out of my head!
I have an idea, let's play 'I spy with my little eye' as we walk! I'll go first. I spy... an eight-foot candy cane.
I spy a snowpony!
I spy somepony eating a gingerbread house...
 ...and it's me!
I can't believe that Princess Celestia chose us to put on the most important play of the season! Do you guys know what an honor this is? For all of us?
Oh, I wish she hadn't honored me quite so much... I can't go onstage! I don't want everypony looking at me!
Fluttershy, darling, there's nothing to feel nervous about.
No?
Of course not. All across Equestria, ponies are preparing their own pageants for Hearth's Warming Eve in their own towns. It's tradition.
So you're saying they'll be too busy to come to our play?
Well, no. We're in the Canterlot pageant, the biggest, most important production in all of Equestria. A lot of ponies will come to watch us.
A lot?
Hundreds.
Hundreds?
 Maybe even thousands!
Oh, my hair! Applejack? Be a dear and shut those windows, will you?
Aaah! Rain-bow-Dash! Rain-bow-Dash! Aaaah! Thank you, thank you!
It's a reenactment of the founding of Equestria. It's not the 'Rainbow Dash Show'.
Well it should be the 'Rainbow Dash Show'! I'm the star!
Fluttershy, you've got to come out of there!
Curtain in two minutes!
Twilight, let me handle this.
My hair!
PINKIE!
The Hearth's Warming Eve pageant is about harmony and friendship.
Shut the window!
 Once upon a time, long before the peaceful rule of Celestia, and before ponies discovered our beautiful land of Equestria, ponies did not know harmony. It was a strange and dark time. A time when ponies were torn apart... by hatred!
 During this frightful age, each of the three tribes – the Pegasi, the unicorns, and the Earth ponies – cared not for what befell the other tribes, but only for their own welfare. In those troubled times, as now, the Pegasi were the stewards of the weather. But they demanded something in return. Food that could only be grown by the Earth ponies.
The unicorns demanded the same, in return for magically bringing forth day and night. And so, mistrust between the tribes festered, until one fateful day, it came to a boil. And what prompted the ponies to clash? 'Twas a mysterious blizzard that overtook the land, and toppled the tribes' precarious peace.
The normally industrious Earth ponies were unable to farm their land.
The Earth ponies were freezing. The home of the Pegasi fared no better. The Pegasi were hungry. And the unicorns were freezing and hungry. Even the unicorns' magic was powerless against the storm. Each tribe blamed the others for their suffering, and the angrier everypony grew, the worse the blizzard became. And so it was decided that a grand summit would be held to figure out a way to cope with the blizzard.
Each tribe sent their leaders.
Daughter of the unicorn king, Princess Platinum.
Ruler of the Pegasi, Commander Hurricane. And lastly...
...leader of the Earth ponies, Chancellor Puddinghead. Perhaps the three tribes could finally settle their differences, and agree on a way to get through this disaster.
Hmph!
And the blizzard raged on.
So the summit of the tribes did not turn out as well as hoped, and the three leaders returned home to lick their wounds, and basically complain.
 And so, each leader encountered obstacles along the way, but eventually, they all arrived in a new and wondrous land. Nopony had ever seen paradise before.
 And so the paradise that the ponies had found was soon lost, buried beneath a thick blanket of snow and hard feelings. Instead of beautiful, it was blizzardy. Instead of wonderful, it was wintry! Instead of spectacular, it was snow-tacular! Instead of–
We get it! Move on!
 Everypony was forced to seek shelter. They searched high and low, but the only shelter for miles was a cold and desolate cave. And, of course, the three tribes had to share it, and nopony was too happy about that.
 And it even began to melt their hearts.
 The three leaders agreed to share the beautiful land, and live in harmony ever afterwards. And together, they named their new land...
Equestria!
We should be so honored that Princess Celestia chose us! She must really think we exemplify what good friends are!
Applejack, I thought you closed all the windows.
Don't blame me. Rainbow Dash should've flown up there and shut it. After all, she's got wings.
Why do I always have to do all the high up chores? Why can't Twilight use her magic for a change!
Y'know what? I got it.
The timberwolves are a-howlin'! The timberwolves are a-howlin'!
Eeyup.
The zap apples are comin'! The zap apples are comin'!
Yay, the zap apples are comin'!
That's what I said.
Hey, silly goose! Quit your gawkin' and move your caboose!
Eeyup.
Ready, Granny!
Ready for what?
For makin' zap apple jam!
Darn tootin'! It's time for some good old-fashioned zap apple jammin'!
Yes, ma'am. I can't wait, ma'am!
 Wait for what?
To make zap apple jam with you!
O'course. Now I been doing this ever since I was a little pony, so be warned, pickle pear. There's a whole mess o' steps in this process and you gots to get each one of them just right, or no zap apple jam. Take this.
Uh, is this one of your gazillion secret herbal ingredients for the zap apple jam?
That there's a broom. Now get sweepin', pipsqueak! Now while you sweep, I'll get to, uh... something there... umm... Oh, ponyfeathers. Bet I'd forget my mane if it wasn't attached to my head.
There's the zap apple leaves, right on schedule!
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L-M-N-O-P...
Well, howdy-doo there, Filthy Rich!
Hello, Mrs. Smith. Did I hear right that there's a zap apple harvest coming in a few days?
Four days, to be exact.
Excellent news, and as usual, I get your first hundred jars?
'Course, Filthy.
Uh, I prefer Rich.
Oh, and how is your pappy doin'?
Oh, you poor, poor thing, having to make all that zap apple jam with Granny Smith.
Actually, I been looking forward to making zap apple jam for years!
I'm not talking about the jam. I'm talking about Granny Smith! You must be sooo embarrassed.
 Soup's on!
Uh, what do ya mean?
You know, with all her silly ways, how she forgets things, and makes you wear these ridiculous costumes?
Granny said that the water needs–
Thank goodness you're here on the farm and not in town where everypony could see you.  Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.
"Silly ways"?
Uh, thank you kindly, Filthy!
Shake a leg there, slowpoke! We got a gaggle's worth of goods to gather before the harvest. Come on! 
Hey! You bite it, you buy it!
Granny, isn't there a less... silly way to get the honey? 
Oh, isn't this just precious?
Please stop!
And it is perfect for makin' our zap apple jam!
Shh! Stop it, Granny!
Granny, please! Those ponies over there are watchin' me!
What? Are those fillies your friends? Hello, Half-pint's friends!
Hiii, Granny Smith! Hiii,  Half-pint!
What dolls. Why, when I was little, ponies didn't come that purdy.
Are we done shopping, Granny? 'Cause I'd like to get back to the farm, fast.
All done, smellybelly.  I got my honey, gooey-goo! Got my honey, gooey-ooh! Got my honey, iddley-hoo!
And, by capturing the whole sale market, purchasing in bulk and slashing all prices, we undermine every other gift market in town, and that's how Rich's Barnyard Bargains became the cornerstone of retail in Ponyville.
Well, thank you, Mr. Filthy—I mean, Mr. Rich. What a wonderful day of sharing! And thank you for being a part of Family Appreciation Day! Now, uh, let's see who will be bringing in a family member for next Monday's Family Appreciation Day. Um... Oh! Apple Bloom!
But Miss Cheerilee. Monday is zap apple harvest day, and Applejack and Big McIntosh will be too busy to come and speak.
Well, is there anypony else in your family that could–
Miss Cheerilee. Apple Bloom's Granny Smith isn't working harvest. She could come.
Oh! But, uh, no, that wouldn't–
That's a splendid idea, Diamond Tiara! Apple Bloom, you shall bring in Granny Smith on Monday.
Have a great weekend, everypony!
Granny Smith? Come Monday, I'll be the laughin' stock of Ponyville!
I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. I already told you that we just can't take a break from harvest to come to your school. You know what'll happen.
I know... After the fifth day, the zap apples disappear...
Look! The third sign! Right on time! Hot diggity!
Wow!
Alright, you lazy daisies, move your caboose!
I'm sorry, Apple Bloom, but don't you fret. Granny Smith's got no shortage of entertainin' stories to tell.
I know. That's what I'm worried about.
I'll be embarrassed, shamed, disgraced, mortified, humiliate–
What are you, a dictionary?
Snap out of it. We're here to help you!
After all, we are the Cutie Mark Crusaders. We'll figure out a way to postpone your presentation.
But how? Ugh! All this worry is makin' me sick!
Sick?
That's it! C'mon!
Ten-hut! Now listen here, troops! Now, I don't want any whinin' or cryin' or crackin' under pressure! Do I make myself clear!?
Court-martialed!
Stay still, Apple Bloom! You have to look sick!
Aaah!  Hey, this is hot!
What in the hayseed is going on in there, silly billy?
Oh, Granny Smith! We were just about to come get you!
Apple Bloom's sick! Looks like she might have to stay home all week!
 Ooh! Perfect as a Piccadilly pear!
Now what?
It's already almost sundown! Tomorrow is Sunday, and I only have one more day to figure something out!
Hey! Look!
That's the fourth sign!
The zap apples have appeared!
And that gives me an idea!
We can't move Family Appreciation Day, so let's move harvest day instead!
They don't look... quite ripe.
Harvesting apples early never hurt an apple.
I don't know... Zap apple trees aren't like normal apple trees. They're magic.
How different can they be?
Well if we can't buck 'em, let's just pick 'em!
Any other bright ideas?
Granny Smith, it's Miss Cheerilee! Apple Bloom said you wanted to speak with me?... Hello? Granny Smi–
 Well hello there! Howdydoo!
Hi... uh... Granny Smith... is, ugh, everything okay?
 Of course it is! Why wouldn't it be?
 Oh, er, excuse me. Uh, pickles always give me the hiccups! I need to tell you that I can't make the presentation on Monday after all!
Oh no, is that so?
 No doubts about it! I gotta shear the flowers and water the sheep! I mean, I have to water the flowers and shear the sheep!
Oh, well, that's too bad. We can reschedule.
E- whut- hai- where am I? Well, howdy, Miss Cheerilee! You window shopping?
Uh... no? You asked me to come here to tell me that you wouldn't be making it to Family Appreciation Day?
Fiddlesticks! I wouldn't miss it for all the tea in Canterlot!
But- didn't you just say...?
See you Monday!
 I wish I could just run off and hide!
Well, you can't run off... but maybe somepony else can!
Yee-haw!
The zap apple harvest has begun!
And tomorrow we will be makin' up some zap apple jam!
 Miss Granny Smith? Telegram.
Well, bust my buttons. Uncle Apple Strudel wants me to pay him a visit.
And you can just make the 8AM train. I already packed you a bag!
Well, that was considerate.
But don't you worry, flibbertigibbet! I'll be back in time to make that jam!
 That train ride takes all day. I'm safe. Hah.
For today's Family Appreciation Day, we are pleased to welcome Granny Smith. Um... Apple Bloom? Is Granny Smith here?
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Cheerilee, but she got called out of town on account of a family emergency–
Well, howdy, my little ponies!
Howdy, y'all! I'm as happy as a pig in a fresh mudpile to be here!
Whuh- what are you doing here? Did you miss the train?
Er, no, it came. And Uncle Apple Strudel was on it.
Ooooooh, noogie-noogie-noggie! 
I can't wait to hear Granny Smith's presentation.  If she can remember any of it.
Long ago, when I was a little pony, things were very different here in Ponyville, 'cause there was no Ponyville!
 That's right, my little ponies. Me and my family were pilgrim pony folk, back when I was a little filly. Oh, we ventured far and wide, collecting new seeds and sellin' the old. But my pa was the finest seed collector in all of Equestria. Then, one day, the Smith family found themselves in the most brilliant, most grand, most magnificent of all cities. A place called... Canterlot. Well, I bet your hooves to hindquarters I had never seen anything like it before nor since. And as if the beauty of that city wasn't enough, suddenly, she appeared. Princess Celestia, the most regal of all ponies. When lo and behold, she stopped to look at my pa's seed collection. Then Princess Celestia saw that we were plumb-tuckered and hankerin' to find our forever home. And bein' a royal Princess and all, she knew exactly the place for us to lay down our stakes. My pa gave the Princess a mighty thanks. We quickly found that land near the Everfree Forest, and we built our first home. Next, we planted our first orchards. But an orchard don't grow overnight, and we were getting mighty short on food. Now mind you, we were cautioned about the forest, and we knew that it was not fit to enter.
 But I knew there was critters livin' there. There must be somethin' to eat. It was dark and musty, and I won't lie, it was scary. But every inch was covered in plant life, and before I knew it, wasn't I standin' in front of the most incredible apple trees! I had never seen anything that bore this kind of colorful fruit! Oh I started picking apples quick as a whip!
 I turned, and there before me stood the timberwolves! I've never run so fast in my life. I did the only thing I could think of.
 My pa and I planted those special apple seeds, and before our eyes they grew like wildfire. Why, we had full grown trees faster than you could say 'lickety split'. Then each year, I paid close attention to the signs of the zap apples' special harvesting times. How the weather affects the Everfree Forest, how the timberwolves howl when the zap apples first start growing, and how they zapped away if you didn't pick 'em all in one day! And the fruits of our labor were the best fruit we ever tasted. Soon enough I was mixing up batches of zap apple jam. Just like harvestin' the zap apples had its special rules, so did makin' zap apple jam. I learned that you gotta be extra friendly with the bees, otherwise their honey won't taste rightly sweet to mix in with the zap apples. Who'd'a thought that glass jars needed talkin' to? Or that zap apples like pink polka dots? But magic is as magic does. Just funny that way. Then ponies started comin' to our farm from far and wide just to get a taste of my zap apple jam. Some of them decided to stay, like Stinkin' Rich, Diamond Tiara's great grandfather. Matter of fact, the first thing he ever sold was my zap apple jam.
 And before we knew it, we had ourselves a nice little town, bustling with all kinds of ponies. And that is how Ponyville was founded.
Oh, thank you kindly, little ponies. Oh, now now, let's settle down.
So if it weren't for you and the zap apples, Ponyville wouldn't even exist?!
Darn tootin', little filly!
If it weren't for my Granny Smith, your daddy wouldn't have Barnyard Bargains.
But–
But she's just a... kooky old lady!
She is not a kooky old lady! She is the most amazing pony in all of Ponyville!
I think this is the best zap apple jam I've tasted yet!
Must be 'cause you had something to do with it, Apple Bloom.
You betcha. Apple Bloom is one humdinger of a zap apple jammer!
I am?
So I take it Family Appreciation Day went well?
Did it? My Granny Smith is super special! I just forgot that for a little while.
Aw, don't fret. I forget things all the time. Now, I'll getcha... er... somethin'. Aw.
Who wants to help Granny sing to the water?
We do, we do!
A, B, C, D, E, F, G... 
Diamond Tiara?
But dad!
Can you believe the new baby is finally here?
Cup Cake and Carrot Cake must be so proud!
I wonder if it's a filly or a colt?
I wanna see the new baby pony! I wanna see! Which one is it?!
Meet our son, Pound Cake.
Awwww.
...and our daughter, Pumpkin Cake.
Huh?
Two new foals for me to play with?  That's two, two, two times the fun! This is the greatest day ever! We need to celebrate your birthday, babies, 'cause you were just born today! Woo-hoo!
Shhh. The babies are trying to sleep.
But I was just–
Shhh.
But–
Shhh!
 Happy happy birthday to you and you today–
Now how in thunderation is one of them twins a Pegasus and the other one a unicorn?
Easy. My great-great-great-great grandfather was a unicorn, and Cup Cake's great aunt's second cousin twice removed was a Pegasus. That makes sense, right?
Aw, yeah! Heh, just you wait! Once little Pound Cake there gets his wings going, he'll be all over the place.
And be careful around Pumpkin Cake.
Baby unicorns get strange magic surges that come and go.
Quick! Make a wish and blow out your candles! Which is easy, 'cause there are zero candles! You are zero years old, after all!
Shhh!
Are you ready for your favoritest game in the whole wide world? Where's Pinkie Pie...? Here I am! Where's Pinkie Pie...? Here I am! Where's Pinkie Pie...? Here I am!
Here I am! Here I am! Here I am! 
Everything okay in there? Who needs a diaper change?
Don't worry, they're fine!  Oogh, I mean...
Oh, I got it.
Is anypony hungry?
Ah, no thanks. I just had a big breakfast.
I'm on it.
Oh, oh, you're making funny faces! I have one! Bleghhh!
 No, y'see, Pinkie, the babies need to be burped.
All set now? Everything good? Okay, who wants to play again?
Uh uh uh, Pound Cake, no pounding things.
Uh uh uh uh, we don't chew on things, Pumpkin Cake.
Except food.
 Food! Great cinnamon sticks, I completely forgot.
No, you just fed them bottles, remember?
Not the babies' food!
Gh! The food for the enormously big catering order we have to deliver today!
Oh, with the new twins, we've been so distracted!
Gh, quick, honeybun, we need to find a babysitter to watch the foals while we take care of this.
I could do it! I wanna do it! Oh, the babies love playing with me, I'll do it!
I wonder who would be available on such short notice.
Me! Me! Pick me!
Oh, I would love to babysit! But I can't today, sorry. I promised Angel we'd go on a picnic. You understand, don't you? Y-you're not mad at me, are you? Please don't be mad at me!
I'll do it! Pick me!
I have to finish this report for the Princess summarizing all my other reports to the Princess.
I wanna babysit! Pick me!
Babysit? Now? When there's a swarm o' hungry caterpillars headin' this way? I gotta get all these apples picked before they get swarmed on!
Ooh, ooh, I wanna do it!
I got tickets to the Wonderbolts airshow this afternoon. Gotta dash!
Ask me! Mememememememememememememe!
Moi? Babysit? N- Oh nonononononononono! I'm flattered that you would think about me though.
 Pinkie Pie, how would you like to babysit for us?
 I dunno. I'll have to check my schedule.
Now, Pinkie, are you sure you really understand the responsibility of watching over two babies?
I can be responsible. Why, responsibility is my middle name. Pinkie Responsibility Pie.
But this time you need to take care of them, not just play with them. You have to be responsible.
Yes, I know. I will. I am.
Oh, here you are, dearie. All your responsibilities are on this list.
Whoa! That's a lot of responsi– Consider it done.
 We'll frost it when we get there! C'mon, sugarplum, tick-tick!
Take good care of our two precious little ginger snaps!
No problemo, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. Everything is under control.
Uh-oh.
Oh, don't cry, little friends! Look, look! Where's Pinkie Pie...? Where's Pinkie Pie?
Oh no... I'm right here, see?
Oh, think think think... Aha!
Hey guys, watch this!
Hey, you're a wonderful crowd here tonight! Where y'all from? Wow, that's great. Y'know, I used to have an ant farm, but I had to get rid of it because... I couldn't find tractors that small!
Get it? Tractors that small?  The other day, I spilled spot remover on my dog... and now I can't find him!
Gee, tough crowd.  Tell me about it. Fine, I wasn't gonna pull off a show stopper, but you're a lovely audience and I think you deserve it!
There, see? Nothing to this babysitting business! Ugh!
Snack time. That's easy enough. Okie-dokie! Eat up! Like this! Num-num-num, num-num-num-num! Ahh!
Nom-
No, Pumpkin Cake, we eat food, not tablecloths.
Huh, huh? Uh, hey, guys, look at me!
Achoo!
Yeah. I think I can see where this is going. 
Towels are not food, Pumpkin Cake!
Drop it... Drop it... Drop it!?
Ooh, look, guys! Bubbles! 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, don't cry! Look, look, uh, floating things! Ooh, aaah, eeh!
Uh, don't make me do it, guys! You know what happens when you mix flour and water, don't you?
 Easy... easy...
Wait- no- stay there- just- for a second- stand still, I've almost-
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
Oh! Thank goodness they're home!
Hi! I finished up the work I had to do, so I thought I'd stop by and see if you needed any help. Whoa!
Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming! I can't begin to tell you what my day has been like! I mean, these babies just won't listen to reason, and don't even get me started on their taste in stand-up comedy.
It's okay, Pinkie. I figured you would need some help. That's why I stopped by.
Ex-cuse me?
Babies take a lot of work, and some ponies are just not cut out to handle the responsibility.
Is that so? Well, thanks for stopping by, Twilight. Sorry, I don't have time to visit. I'm very very busy with my responsibilities here.
I'm happy to help! It's no trouble–
Well, of all the– She thinks I can't handle things on my own! Maybe because I haven't handled things on my own. Well, I can handle things on my own!
Pound Cake.  This is a crib. It is only to be used for napping, sleeping, and on occasion with permission, as a pretend old-timey Western fort. It is not a trampoline, so stop your jumping right now, mister!
And you, young filly. We do not put anything in our mouth that we cannot safely and properly digest, so stop slobbering on that toy this instant!
Now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon, and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap. So, fall asleep!
 Sleep tight.
Now that's what I call handling things. 
Oh, nononono. Not good, not good, not good! Pound? Pumpkin? Where are you? Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Whoa! You be a good little girl now, Pumpkin-wumpkin, and stay in your crib for your pal Pinkie-winkie!
Pound Cake?  Here, Pound Cake!
Uh, Pound Cake? Uh...
 You can fly?!
Oh... get down here... this instant... young... colt!  I'm responsible for you!
 Nom nom nom.
No no no, Pumpkin.
Nom nom.
No no.
Nom.
No. Hmph! I am the responsible one, and I said no.
Wheeee!
That goes for you too, Pound Cake!
Gotcha! I think? 
Mm, razzleberry. I'm- not- letting- go! I'm- re-spon-si-ble!
Oh, not you too! There! Now who's the responsible one?
 Y'know, you're right. That is funny.
Dear Princess Celestia,
Pinkie Pie! We're back!
How did everything go? 
Are we in the right place?
Shhh!
P-Pinkie. This is just... just...
Amazing is what it is. We had no idea how responsible you really are. Would you be interested in becoming our go-to babysitter on a permanent basis?
 Hm- Ah- lemme check my schedule! I should be available a week from... never!
Pinkie...
Pie...
 I have some free time next Tuesday.
Whoo-- Whoa! Whoo-hoo! Applejack, you're sure to knock everypony's hat off at the Equestria Rodeo competition!
Aw shucks, Apple Bloom. I sure hope so.
Hope so? I know so! After all, you're the ten-time rodeo champeen of Ponyville! Why, you've got more blue ribbons than anypony in Ponyville ever! And I can't wait for my big sis to win every blue ribbon in Equestria and bring home the title of Equestria Rodeo champeen!
Huh? Now, {{H:title|&quot;be careful&quot; in the updated iTunes re-release and just &quot;careful&quot; on subsequent television airings|careful, Derpy}}! Don't want to do any more damage than you've already done.
I just don't know what went wrong.
Yeah. It's a mystery.
Nice work, Rainbow Dash.
You okay, Rainbow Dash? Anything I can do to help?
No! Nothing! In the name of Celestia, just sit there and do nothing!
Oops. My bad.
Applejack! Applejack! Applejack! Applejack! 
Everypony, can I get your attention? Attention please!
Yes, we are all here to send Applejack to compete in this year's Equestria Rodeo competition in Canterlot.
And I want to thank Applejack in advance for generously offering up her prize money to fix town hall.
Yeah, Applejack! Whoo-hoo!
Speech! Speech!
Oh, shucks. I'm not much for speeches.
Alright then, no speech!
Buuut! This here is the nicest send off anypony could ask for. Y'all have been cheering me on in every rodeo since I was a little little pony. So it seems only fittin' to use my winnings to fix up town hall. I promise to make Ponyville proud.
I want you to show all them highfalutin rodeo ponies what a real rodeo pony's like!
You betcha, Granny Smith.
And bring back all that money!
You betcha, Mayor.
And have fun. And don't be nervous. Or if you are, use that nervous energy to do even better than you already would! And eat peanuts and popcorn and taffy and taffy gives lots of nervous energy! 
Just do your best, Applejack.
I'll do better than my best!
The train to Canterlot is about to leave! All aboard who's coming aboard!
Guess that means me.
Seeya in a week!
With lots of new blue ribbons!
And lots of money!
Darn tootin'! See y'all in a week, with a big bag full of blue ribbons!
And drink sarsaparilla! What? It gives you extra sass.
Oh, I hope Applejack is surprised by this surprise party!
Well, that is the point.
I know, but I hope she isn't so surprised she's startled, because while being surprised can be nice, being startled can be... very startling.
Surprise!
 Oh, Pinkie, you startled me.
Sorry! I was just practicing my "surprise!" for when we surprise Applejack with this super cool party for becoming rodeo champeen of Equestria! Surprise!
Quiet, Pinkie, I think Applejack's coming!
Don't worry, Twilight. Got my lips all limbered up! 
Surprise!
Surprise! Shoot!
Wow, this is the best surprise ever! How did you know it was my birthday?
Who's it from, Twilight? What's it say?
It's from Applejack. "Family and friends, not coming back to Ponyville."
"...Don't worry, will send money soon." That's all there is.
Applejack's... not comin' back?
What do you mean Applejack's not coming back?! She loves Ponyville!
And she loves Sweet Apple Acres!
And she loves her family!
 Something just dreadful must have happened to Applejack to make her not return!
Maybe she's hurt, or sad, or scared!
So, what are we waiting for? Let's go find her!
Don't worry. We'll search all of Equestria if we have to. We'll bring her back.
Y'all are the best.
Thank you, girls!  Our little bushel just lost one apple.
I hope this lead doesn't turn out to be a dead end. I don't wanna go home empty-hooved after promising we'd find her.
I don't know how we'll break it to the Apple family.
I don't know how we'll break it to Ponyville!
I don't know how I'll make it to the next stop!
This is Dodge Junction, girls. Applejack is supposed to have come here after the rodeo ended. Let's fan out and try to find her.
Ooh, pickles!  Hurryhurryhurryhurryhurry! Hurry it up in there!
Huh, some ponies. Sheesh.
Applejack! I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her!
Oh, Applejack, thank heavens!
We're so glad you're safe!
I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her! Be right back.
Uh, hey, everypony. What's up?
Why didn't you come back to Ponyville?!
Yes, why are you here?
Are you okay?
Do you have any snacks?
Tell us what happened, Applejack!
Applejack? Are these some of your Ponyville friends?
Yes, ma'am.
And you are?
Why, I'm Cherry Jubilee, boss of Cherry Hill Ranch. Hasn't Applejack told ya? I saw her compete at the Equestria Rodeo. Never saw anypony win so many ribbons in all my life.
Aw shucks, Miss Jubilee. You don't have to go into all that.
Oh, she's so modest. Anyway, I can always use a pony with quick hooves and a strong back. So, when I heard Applejack was looking for a change of scenery, I snapped her up as quick as I could and brought her to Dodge Junction. Well, I'll let you catch up with your friends. See you back at the ranch.
"Change of scenery"? What's that supposed to mean?
S'no big deal, guys. I thought cherries would be a nice change from apples, so I took the job and came here. That's it. End of story.
That's it? Well, that's a terrible story!
Sorry, but that's all there is to tell. Thanks for checkin' on me, but y'all can go home now. Tell my family hi, and that I'm doing a-okay.
Excuse me, AJ, but we didn't travel all over Equestria searching for you to come home without you!
Well, I didn't ask you to come lookin' for me! There is nothin' to tell and I am not going back to Ponyville!
I don't care what she says. Applejack's not telling us something.
Twilight's right. We gotta get her to spill the beans.
What?! She had beans? Ugh, I told her I was snacky!
You ready to put your back into it, Applejack?
Sure am, Miss Jubilee.
Terr-ific. Come on in, girls!
What are you all doing here?
We're your cherry sorters. Shall we get started?
Fine.
Haha, red cherries go in one bin, and yellow cherries go in the other. Simple as cherry pie. Uh, just one teensy thing to remember – have fun!
What are you five up to?
Well, uh, you made working on a cherry orchard sound... so delightful.
Uh-huh. Well, just remember: No talking about Ponyville.
Fine! Why don't you quit talking and get walking?
So, AJ, how was Canterlot? Not talking about Ponyville, talking about Canterlot, totally different town.
Canterlot was fine.
Was the rodeo fun?
Yes.
Did you meet some nice ponies there?
Some.
Really? Did you see Wild Bull Hickok? What about Calamity Mane?
Yes, I saw 'em both.
And how did you meet Miss Jubilee?
Um, well, Miss Jubilee had a cherry stand at the rodeo. Real good treats.
Um, excuse me?
Cherry winks, cherry cheesecake, cherry tarts. We struck up a conversation, being orchard folk and all.
So you told her about Sweet Apple Acres?
Yes.
Did you tell her why you weren't going back?
No, 'cuz it was none of her business!
Ooh... Can you please slow down?
Is it because I made it rain on you that one time?
No!
Help!
Is it because you were insulted when I gave you that book on organized orchards?
NO!
Is it because you were insulted when I insulted your hair?
No, no, NO! I'm not telling you why, so just–
STOP!
Well, girls, we seem to be striking out.
That's 'cause we're playing too nice.
Yes. Desperate times do call for desperate measures.
It's time to call in the big guns.
Hey, Applejack. Need some help?
You promise not to ask me any questions?
I promise.
Have you ever had a cherrychanga? Ooh! Sorry, that was a question.
That kind of question is fine, Pinkie. No, I-I never had a cherrychanga.
Well, no wonder, because I made it up myself! A cherrychanga is mashed up cherries in a tortilla that's deep fried. Cherrychanga. Great name, huh? Oh, but maybe I should call it a chimicherry. Ooh, that's good too. Which do you think sounds better? Cherrychanga or chimicherry? Or what if I combine them? Chimicherrychanga! What sounds the funniest? I like funny words! One of my favorite funny words is 'kumquat'! I didn't make that one up. I would work in a kumquat orchard just so I could say 'kumquat' all day! Kumquat, kumquat, kumquat! And 'pickle barrel'! Isn't that just the funnest thing to say? Pickle barrel, pickle barrel, pickle barrel! Say it with me! Pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, chimicherrychanga!
No! Make it stop, make it stop!
The only way to make it stop is for you to spill the beans!
Never!
Speaking of beans, did you ever realize how many words rhyme with 'beans'? Lean, mean, spleen, unclean, bean... 
Alright, alright! I'll tell everypony what's goin' on! Just please stop talkin'! But... can it wait 'til tomorrow at breakfast? I'm plum tuckered out.
Tomorrow, huh? I don't know...
Do you Pinkie promise?
 I will tell you the whole truth at breakfast. Pinkie promise.
I'm glad we're finally gonna get some answers from Applejack.
Yeah, maybe.
Don't worry, Rainbow. She's gotta 'fess up after making a Pinkie promise.
Good morning, Applejack. You ready for br– 
Nopony breaks a Pinkie promise!
Applejack!  You Pinkie promised!
Applejack, come back here!
Giddy up, fellas, I gotta get the heck out of Dodge!
She's gonna get away!
Oh no, she won't! Look, girls!
Follow that stagecoach! Oh, we have you now!
Whoa! What the hay?
Pull over!
Hey! Cut that out! Whoa!  I'll pay you double to outrun them.
We'll pay you triple to slow down!
I'll pay you quadruple to leave them in the dust!
That was rude!
Get them! Get them!
Come on, Fluttershy!
Hyah! C'mon, y'all! Go, go!
Applejack, you broke your Pinkie promise! Apologize!
Pinkie, I did not break my promise!
Wha?
If y'all reckon back, I told you that I would tell you everything at breakfast. But I didn't come for breakfast. I couldn't come to that breakfast, not if it meant telling y'all what happened.
Well, I... I...
I'm sorry, Pinkie, but I can't tell y'all the truth. I just can't!
Well I heard a "sorry" in there, so that'll have to do for now. I'll get a real apology later. Rarity, catch me.
What? Pinkie– 
Rainbow, go back!
No time! They knew what they were getting into!
Yes. Hyah!
Yee-haw!
 Lady, you're trouble.
Ha, try and catch me now. Oh, nuts.
Not so fast!
Fine. Now you know.
Know what?
Well, just look!
I am. You won an amazing number of ribbons, just like Miss Jubilee said!
Don't you get it? There's every color of ribbon down there. Every color... but... blue. I came in fourth, third, even second, but I didn't win one first prize, and I certainly didn't win any prize money.
But the telegram said you were gonna send money.
That's why I came here. I wanted to earn some money. After that big old send off Ponyville gave me, I just didn't have the nerve to come home empty-hooved. I couldn't come home a failure.
Applejack, you're not a failure.
And we're your friends! We don't care if you came in fiftieth place! You're still number one in our books.
So... you're not upset or disappointed?
Nn-nn.
But what about the mayor? I don't think I can face her and tell her I didn't get that money to fix the broken roof.
Applejack, we can always find a way to fix that hole in the roof. But if you don't come back, we'll never be able to fix the hole in our hearts.
 Darn it! Now you got me acting all sappy!
Dear Princess Celestia,
What do you think, Rarity? Chimicherry or cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? 
When I get back, you're gonna get it, Rainbow Dash! 
 Who could that be? It's still dark!
C'mon, Fluttershy! Cider season's about to start!
 Oh, where are we? What's the rush?
The rush? Don't you remember what happened last year? Or the year before that? Or pretty much any cider season ever?
Um, well, uh–
Pinkie Pie. She always ends up ahead of us in line, and then they always run out of cider!
I guess I–
Well, not this year! This year I'm gonna get there before sunrise, so I can drink all the cider I want and laugh when she doesn't get any! It's the perfect plan. Y'know, I might even buy some cider and hold onto it for a while, drinking it drop by drop in front of her– 
Gee, Rainbow Dash. It looks like a few other ponies had the same idea.
Oh, gosh, Pinkie. I love your new style.
Who are all these ponies?!
Isn't this great? I couldn't sleep last night 'cause I was so excited about cider season, and I had this brilliant idea to come down here and camp out, so I told a few others about it, and they all thought it was a great idea too, and now it's just a big old cider party! Woo-hoo! Oh, gosh, that's a lot of ponies. Hope they don't run out before you get any.
Isn't this exciting, Spike? Opening day of cider season!
Yeah! That means it's only thirty more days 'til sapphire season!
 Attention, everypony! Cider season is now officially open!
Heh. Sorry, everypony! That's it for today!
Awww.
Surprise, surprise. You ran out again!
Yeah, you always run out!
For the record, I don't mind–
Why can't you make enough cider for all of us? Or at least for me!
Hold on, everypony. We've done our best to improve supply this year-
You always say that!
And it's always true. But Apple family cider is made with love and integrity, and only the highest quality apples in Equestria. Sorry, but that recipe takes time.
If y'all just be patient, we'll have plenty more tomorrow.
She's right, y'know! You can't rush perfection! And this year's batch was perfection!
Uh, Pinkie Pie–
I'll never forget the cider I just drank! It was a moment in time that will never exist again. 
What in Equestria is that?
You got a deal!
Not so fast! No way no how that machine matches up with the care we put in our cider!
But if it really does work, we could make everypony in town happy!
I just don't know, y'all. We've always made cider the same way.
Eeyup. Huh?
We'll sweeten the deal. You supply the apples...
...We supply the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000.
Then we split those sweet sweet profits...
...Seventy-five...
...Twenty-five.
Deal–
Hold on. Who gets the seventy five?
Why, us, naturally.
And, we'll throw in the magic to power the machine for free.
Cider sales keep our business afloat through the winter. We'd lose Sweet Apple Acres if we agreed to this.
So? What'll it be?
No deal.
Hmph. Very well. If you refuse our generous offer to be partners, then we'll just have to be competitors.
You wouldn't dare.
Oh no?
Don't you worry, everypony! There'll be plenty of cider for all of you!
 Once we drive Sweet Apple Acres out of business.
What?
Still worried about Flim and Flam?
Granny Smith says they were just blowing hot air.
I'm not so sure. They sounded mighty serious when they threatened to run us out of business.
That's it! Last cup!
Oh, for Pete's sake!
C'mon back tomorrow, everypony!
What seems to be the problem here?
Oh my, oh my, out of cider again?
What have we here? Who'd like a cup?
Don't worry, everypony, we've got the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 to make more in an instant!
You can't sell that cider! That's made from Apple family apples!
Is this some kind of cruel joke?
Don't worry, everypony, there are plenty of apples in Equestria. We'll find some others and make more cider than all of Ponyville can drink!
We'll make more cider than you could ever imagine!
Now, it ain't about the speed, young'un, it's about quality.
Who cares how good the cider is if I never get to drink any?
Oh, look at these poor, dissatisfied ponies.
Ponyville is Sweet Apple Cider country!
Our cider speaks for itself!
Let's put it to the test!
Anywhere, anytime!
Well, that's enough now.
With our machine, we can make enough cider in one hour to satisfy this entire town!
We'll do it in 45 minutes!
Easy, Apple Bloom, easy.
What's the matter, Granny Smith? Chicken?
What did you call me, sonny?
If you're so confident in your cider, then what's the problem?
Tomorrow mornin', right here!
But I'm afraid we haven't any...  ...apples.
You can use our south field! It'll be worth it to teach y'all a thing or two about cider making!
Excellent; we have a bet. Whoever produces the most barrels in one hour wins the exclusive right to sell cider in Ponyville.
And after we beat ya, I don't never want to see you bambahoozlers around here again!
Until tomorrow.
Don't worry, Applejack, I know you'll win tomorrow!
We'd better, 'cause if we don't, we're gonna lose our farm.
Applejack? Are you sure this is such a good idea?
Me 'n' the family are... one hundred percent confident... in our cider making capabilities.
And besides, nopony calls Granny a chicken.
 Attention, everypony!
Well, good luck.
Thanks, Twilight. We'll need it.
 The teams have one hour to produce as much cider as they can, after which the barrels will be counted and the winner will be named the sole cider provider for all of Ponyville!
Are both teams ready?
Ready!
Ready!
Then let's... go!
Ugh, bad 'un. Good 'un! Bad 'un...
Great job, y'all! We've already filled an entire barrel!
I'll bet you those guys don't even have–
What?!
C'mon, Apple Bloom, focus! We gotta forget those guys if we're gonna have a chance of winnin'!
Sorry, sis! Better keep up, Granny, we're fallin' behind!
Egh...  Good 'un... Ugh, bad 'un...
Rest when it's over, Big McIntosh! Ride! Ride!
This is just dreadful. Even at top speed the Apples are only making one barrel to the twins' three!
Um, Miss Mayor! Are honorary family members allowed to help in the competition?
Well, I'm not sure... Flim, Flam, would you object to honorary family members helping?
Are you kidding?
We don't care if the whole kingdom of Canterlot helps. It's a lost cause.
Hm, I guess it's okay. Applejack? What do you think?
I think I'd love to have the rest of my family helpin' out.
All right!
Okay, everypony, we're not gonna let those smooth talkers take our friend's farm.
Yeah!
Fluttershy, help Applejack with the trees.
Got it.
Pinkie Pie, you're on apple catching detail.
Yessir, ma'am, sir!
Rarity, you've got a discerning eye. Help Granny Smith at the quality control station.
Of course.
Rainbow Dash, do you think you can help Big McIntosh press?
In my sleep!
Alright, everypony, let's save Sweet Apple Acres!
All right!
Over there, Apple Bloom! Don't miss them!
Right behind you, Pinkie Pie!
Good 'un, bad 'un, bad 'un, good 'un...
Lovely, horrid, horrid, lovely...
Based on these figures, we're making five barrels for every three of theirs!
Keep it up, everypony! We're back in this!
 Come on, brother, we've gotta pick up the pace!
Right, uh, double the power!
We've gotta try something else!
I've got it, brother of mine.
Well done, Flam! We're at top productivity!
C'mon, Rainbow Dash, keep grinding!
We don't have time for quality control if we wanna win this thing!
 Get back, you! One bad apple spoils the bunch!
Applejack, help me!
There's no point in winnin' if we cheat!
We'll just have to work harder! C'mon, everypony!
All right then, double time!
Time's up!
I'm proud of you, Applejack.
Thanks. 
Integrity like that will always be... rewarded.
Flim and Flam win!
Wh, wh–
We... lost?
Daww, too bad, Apples.
Guess you'll just have to find a new line of work that doesn't match your names quite so... perfectly.
Now should we tear down all these tacky old buildings and put up new ones, brother?
I don't see why not, brother. After all, this isn't Sweet Apple Acres anymore. How about 'Flim Flam Fields'?
I ought to press you into jerk cider!
No, Rainbow Dash. A deal's a deal.
Congratulations to y'all. The cider business in Ponyville... is yours. C'mon, Apples. Let's go pack up our things.
Fear not, everypony, there's more than enough cider to go around.
Go ahead, everypony. Go on, y'all. It's okay.
Drink up, Ponyville! Down the hatch!
I can't get the taste off my tongue!
Mine's got rocks in it!
I wouldn't pay one cent for this dreck!
You wouldn't pay even one cent?
No!
How about two cups for one cent?
No!
 Two bits for a barrel?
NO!
 It looks like we've encountered a slight... problem here in Ponyville.
Nopony wants our product. Next town?
Next town. Let's go, Flim!
Let's go, Flam!
They're gone.
That means Sweet Apple Acres is still in business!
Plus we can have high quality Apple family cider!
Because of this silly competition, we've made enough of our cider for the whole town!
Dear Princess Celestia,
Hey, Rarity. Hey, Pinkie Pie. What are you looking at?
Rainbow Dash! Isn't she the most daring devil? I mean, the most devilish darer? I mean—
She's dazzling!
Ooh, yeah, that's a good word. She's dazzling!
Oh no, oh no, oh no!
Ai yi yi yi yi!
Oohh.
So much for dazzling.
 Is she gonna be okay?
 Oh, I'm so worried!
 Is her face gonna stay that way?
Awwww.
How is she, doctor?
She's going to be fine. Luckily she has friends like you who got her over here in a jiffy.
Huh, how long do I need to lie here? I've got things I need to do!
Well, that all depends on your recovery, but I'd say a few days minimum.
You guys have gotta get me out of here! I'm gonna climb the walls!
Ooh, just like a spider!  Did the crash somehow give her super-duper spider powers?
Nnnno, nor did it give her amazing healing powers. She needs to stay in bed for a few days.
Few days? Might as well be a few months, or a few years!
It's not so bad, Rainbow Dash.
I bet the chow in here is hoof-lickin' good.
And the hospital gowns, they...match the curtains!
And look! You have a roommate!
What's this? 'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Stone'.
This is the first story in the series. I own all of them. 
No thanks. I so don't read. I'm a world-class athlete. Reading's for eggheads like you, Twilight. Heh, no offense, but I am not reading. It's undeniably, unquestionably, uncool.
Is she serious? Who doesn't like to read a bang-up tale from time to time?
Why, a good book is almost as magnificent as silk pajamas on a Sunday morning, heh!
Reading is for everypony, Rainbow Dash!
Yeah! I love reading, and my head isn't even close to the shape of an egg! It's more the shape of an apple, or maybe an orange, but a big orange! More like a grapefruit really...
All right, my little ponies. Rainbow Dash needs her rest. You'll have to come back tomorrow.
I think you'd like Daring. She's a lot like you. Adventurous, fierce, and undeniably, unquestionably, unstoppable.
...to get to the other side! Get it? Never mind...
 "As Daring Do trekked through the tropical jungle, the wet heat sapped her energy and slowed her every step. If only she could escape this oppressive atmosphere and fly up into the cool blue sky. But her crash landing in the jungle had injured her wing and she was grounded for a few days. Few days... it might as well be a few months, or a few years!" Huh. I'm right there with you, sister.
 "The mosquitoes buzzed loudly. The macaws cried from the high trees. Yet all of these distracting noises were not enough to cover the sound of the predators following her every step."
 "Safely landing on the other side, Daring finally allowed herself a moment to breathe. She turned around to find herself face to face with the long lost temple that she had sought tirelessly for over sixty days and nights!"
I hate to admit it to myself, and would really hate to admit it to my friends, but... I love this story! I, I... I love reading! I'm an egghead.
 "The smell of decay and danger hit Daring Do as she peered into the dimly-lit entrance of the ancient temple."
Phew!
Hi, Rainbow Dash!
Uh, hey, guys...
We thought we'd come and cheer you up!
We brought your favorite board game!
We know how much you like to win!
You go first, Rainbow Dash!
 No no, you first.
Alright, uh... cloud three.
Aw, shucks, you... rained on my cumulus, heh. Go again!
Um... sky five?
Whoa, you found my seagull.
Uh... cloud two?
You zapped my weather pony! Uh-huh, you stung my bumblebee. Oh, my thunderbolt. Aw, and that's my last cloud. You found it. Guess you guys win, I lose. 
But Rainbow Dash, you, you didn't even get a turn.
You win some, you lose some.
But you don't lose some. I don't think you've ever lost a game of—
 Thanks for coming!
But yesterday you were desperate for things to do!
Do? Who said anything about Daring Do? I told you I'm not interested in reading. 
Glad we could... cheer you up?
Alright then.
"Daring Do stood at the entrance to the central temple chamber."
 "At last, she was face-to-face with the legendary sapphire statue!"
Hmm, there must be a pattern here. What do all these animals have in common? Ah-ha! These animals are all predators... except... rats! Phew!
s voice]: Hello, Rainbow Dash!
How's our patient doing today?
Ugh, we need to get some fresh air in here. You're lookin' sweatier than a pig wrangler on a summer's day.
Uh, well, guys, thanks for visiting, but—
Okay, now, dinner time for Rainbow Dash.
Oh, just in time. I am sooo hungry.
Oh, well, don't mind us, Rainbow Dash.
Yeah, just go ahead and eat up.
Uh, on second thought—
Uh, we'll see you tomorrow, Rainbow Dash, aheh...
 "'You thought you could evade me and capture the relic for yourself, but you are sadly mistaken, Miss Do.'"
And now, you shall meet your doom! 
Whoa! Who is this dude?
 You won't get away with this, Ahuizotl!
But I already have.
 Not again...
Quicksand! 
 Rainbow Dash?
 Rainbow Da-ash!
H— oh, good evening—
Morning.
—morning. Doc.
Have you been up all night?
Uh, of course not. 
Well, I'll be quick. Congratulations, Rainbow Dash, we're checking you out of the hospital.
What? Later today? 
No. Right now!
Right now?! 'Right now' right now?
'Right now' right now.
But I don't feel better!
Now take it easy, Rainbow Dash. Remember to stay off that wing for a week.
How will I ever find out what happens to Daring Do?!
Is Ahuizotl going to get away with the statuette? What's gonna happen to Daring?! Ah-ha! Twilight has a copy of the book! Uh, but I can't ask her after I called her an egghead and all...
Ugh, this is making me sick all over again!
Owww...  Oh, the pain... the pain!
Rainbow Dash! What are you doing here, a-anything wrong?
Well, uh, my wing! It's still hurtin', Doc. Oh, ouch! Right there.
I was touching your good wing.
Uh, right. Well, I think that one's hurting now too.
 I think I know what the trouble is. A severe case of lazy-itis.
B-But, you got me all wrong, Doc! I'm not being lazy!
You're fine, Rainbow Dash. Give it some time and you'll be right back in the swing of things.
Good day, Rainbow Dash.
Take care!
What am I gonna do? I'll never get to sleep without knowing what happens to Daring Do! ...Which may not be such a bad thing...
Feels like the harder I struggle,  the tighter the ropes get!
s voice]: Help! Burglar, burglar!
Someone's trying to steal my slippers!
I'm not trying to steal your slippers, I'm trying to steal this book!
Stop, thief!
Hey, nopony invited me!
Huh! Hasn't anypony heard of beauty sleep?
Rainbow Dash, what in the world is going on? Why are you stealing slippers?
Hey, get back to the hospital!
What's all the ruckus?
Mmm, I'd say it's more of a fracas than a ruckus.
What's going on, Rainbow Dash?
 I'm an egghead.
Pardon?
See, I was trying to get back into the hospital to finish the last chapter of—
—'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue'!
You got me.
Wow, I knew the book was good, but I didn't know it could drive a pony to petty theft!
Good? Try awesomely amazing. That book is undeniably, unquestionably, un-put-down-able! But then I had to put it down; I was sent home before I could finish it.
Well, I'm glad that's all this is about.
There's no reason to go around causin' a ruckus—
Fracas!
...causin' a fracas just because you like to read.
Like I said, I have every book in the series, and you can borrow them all, any time you like!
Oh, thanks, Twilight. I'm sorry I made such a big deal about all of this. I thought reading was just for smart ponies like you.
Rainbow Dash, just because you're athletic doesn't mean you aren't smart!
Yeah, just look at me! 
Reading is something everypony can enjoy, if they just give it a try.
Yeah, I get it. I shouldn't knock something until I've tried it.
That's a great lesson, and it would make a great letter to the Princess.
 Didja get all that?
Yeah?
Great! You write the letter, I've gotta finish this book! 
 Another day, another dungeon!
I'll take that!
Huh? Wha—? Noooooooo!
Better luck next time, Ahuizotl!
Curse you, Daring Do! 
 "And so, with Ahuizotl defeated, and the sapphire statue secured..."
"...The world was safe and sound once again, thanks to Daring Do!"  'Daring Do and the Griffon's Goblet'. Awesome!
Hmm... I just don't feel like it's quite finished.
I know what you mean. If it's for Miss Cheerilee, it needs to be perfect. Hearts and Hooves Day only comes once a year, after all.
I say we add a little more ribbon!
Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah. And just a tiny bit more lace.
A few more hoof-prints.
Glitter! It could definitely use just a little more glitter!
Now that'll show Miss Cheerilee how much we care about her. Just have to get it to the Hearts and Hooves party at school.
I think we're gonna need a bigger envelope.
I like the red ones.
It's lovely. And so... big!
We just wanted to let you know that we think you're the best teacher in the whole wide world! And we think you're super! And that we love you so so much! And we want you to have the best Hearts and Hooves Day–
Ever!
Thank you so much, girls. I love it. I really do.
I'm sure it's nothing compared to the gifts you've gotten from your... very special somepony.
Oh, I don't have a very special somepony at the moment.
Really?
How could somepony as amazing as you not have a very special somepony on Hearts and Hooves Day?
It's alright, Sweetie Belle. I have lots of good friends and wonderful students who care about me very much. I'm gonna have an absolutely terrific Hearts and Hooves Day. Alright, everypony, who's ready to play "Pin the Heart on the Pony"?
If anypony deserves a very special somepony, it's her.
Uh, you all right?
I'm more than all right. I've just come up with the best idea ever. We're gonna find Miss Cheerilee a very special somepony.
That is the best idea ever.
 Tooold yooou!
So what are we waiting for? Hearts and Hooves Day is almost over! Let's get out there and find somepony special for Cheerilee already.
Yeah!
Let's do it!
Now it can't be just anypony. Miss Cheerilee is one of the best mares in Ponyville. She deserves to have one of the best stallions as her very special somepony.
Sweetie Belle is right. Big McIntosh is the perfect match for Miss Cheerilee. He's really nice, super hard-working.
Hmm... but he's also pretty shy. He's never gonna ask Miss Cheerilee to be his very special somepony.
Maybe he doesn't have to.
Huh?
If we can get Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee in a really romantic setting, I bet she'll ask him.
Sounds like a plan to me.
So? What are we waitin' for? Let's get out there and create the perfect date!
Yay!
Flowers. Don't forget the flowers.
Oops. I'm on it!
 They're coming! This is gonna be perfect. Miss Cheerilee is gonna have the best Hearts and Hooves Day ever.
With her new very special somepony.
Hi, girls.
Hi, Miss Cheerilee.
So you three said you needed help identifying a tree you found here near the gazebo?
 That's an apple tree.
Is it?
Oh, sorry, big brother. We went and fixed up the gazebo all on our own. See?
As long as you're here, why not have a bite to eat from this romantic-looking picnic? Oh gosh, seems like there's only room for two.
I guess we'll just be goin' then.
You really think this'll work?
Of course it will work. They're perfect for each other.
Beautiful day we're having.
Eeyup.
Any big plans for tonight?
Nnnope.
Oh, come on, Miss Cheerilee, ask him to be your very special somepony.
 Ohmigosh, look.
Big Mac...
Eeyup?
You have something stuck in your teeth.
Aw, come on!
Well this has been... strange.
Eeyup.
I need to get going, but it's always great running into a good friend.
Yup.
 Do you think it just wasn't romantic enough?
Maybe it was too romantic.
 Either way, we failed.
 There's gotta be somethin' else we could– UGH!
Oh my goodness, I didn't even see you there. I'm so so sorry.
Aw, it's okay, Twilight. It was an accident.
I've just been reading the most fascinating book about Hearts and Hooves Day. Did you know that this holiday got its start because of a love potion?
Did you say... a love potion?
That's right. It even has the recipe.
I... don't suppose we could borrow that book for a little while, do ya?
Of course you can. I have another book here that I think you'll–
 Take a tuft of cloud;
A bright rainbow's glow;
Stir with a Pegasus feather–
Hey!
Fast, not slow.
Serve to two ponies who aren't in the know.
I feel kind of bad trickin' my brother and Miss Cheerilee this way.
What's the problem? We all agreed these two are perfect for one another.
Yeah, they just need a little nudge.
And what could make them happier than being together, right?
Right!
Oh, oh, here they come.
Hiya, Miss Cheerilee.
Hello again, girls. Hello, Big Mac. Would you three like to tell us why it was so very important that we meet you here–
Punch!
Excuse me?
Punch! We made punch. We were gonna set up a stand and try to sell it but, heh, we needed somepony to taste-test it first.
Yup.
We thought you two would be perfect together. To test it. Together. So, uh, we'll just leave you two alone. Together, to test it. 
I'm very sorry about this. I mentioned to the girls that I don't have a very special somepony, and I believe they're putting us in these awkward situations because they've decided it should be you.
I suppose we should just humor them for a moment. This punch does look delicious.
Eeyup.
I think they're gonna drink it.
To good friends!
They're drinking it. They're drinking it!
They're looking into each other's eyes.
 They're about to be in for a big surprise!
Big Mac?
Yup?
Will you be my very special somepony?
Eeyup.
YES!
 He's her special somepony! She's his special somepony!
He's my special somepony.
Eeeeeyup.
Aww!
He's my shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie.
You're my shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie.
Did he just say–
You're my cutie-patootie lovie-dovie honey-bunny.
You're my heartie-smartie smoochie-woochie baby-waby.
Big Mac! Hey! Hello! What's going on?
Miss Cheerilee, are you alright?
I have a special somepony. A kissy-wissy snuggy-wuggy sugar bear.
I think we may have given them too big of a nudge.
You're my cuddly-wuddly boopsie-woopsie pumpkin pie.
Eugh!!
Ya think?
What have we done?! My brother's actin' like a grade-A goofball!
Maybe we added too much rainbow.
Or maybe not enough cloud.
Or maybe... uh-oh.
Whaddaya mean, "uh-oh?!"
We might not have given Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee a love potion. We may have given them a love poison.
What?!
Apparently, some prince a long time ago whipped up this recipe and gave it to this princess he liked. He meant it to be a love potion, but things didn't turn out so well.
How "not so well" did things turn out?
Well, there's something here about a dragon, the kingdom falling, chaos reigning... Okay, apparently it was all because the prince and princess were so lost in each other's eyes that they couldn't perform their royal duties.
Great! We've not only turned Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee into a couple of nonsense-spoutin' nincompoops, we may have put all of Ponyville in jeopardy!
Come on, Apple Bloom. Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac don't have any royal duties.
But they still got responsibilities. If we don't fix this... Oh no, Miss Cheerilee won't be able to teach. Big Mac won't be able to harvest any apples, and before you know it... Ponyville will be overrun with uneducated little ponies starvin' for apples. Oh, it'll be chaos! It'll be chaos!
There's an antidote!
Well, why didn't you say so? Didn't you see me gettin' all panicked back there?
If we can keep Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac from looking into each other's eyes for one full hour, the love curse will be broken.
Only an hour? Pfh, we can pull that off in a second.
You take the first sip, snuggle-wuggles.
No, you take it, schnoodle-dumplin'.
No, you, shnooky-lumps.
No, you, pookie-pie.
I'm all for romance, but this has been going on for hours. What's happened to these two?
 Who knows?
Well, these lovebirds will probably be planning a wedding soon. I can always use the catering business.
A wedding! That's it! Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac should get married!
How is gettin' hitched gonna keep them apart?
They aren't really gonna get married. They're just gonna get ready to get married.
 No, you, biscuit-wiscuit bear!
Nope, you, huggy-wuggy snuggy bunny!
Hi, Miss Cheerilee, how are you?
I have a very special somepony.
I have a very special somepony.
Yeah, we noticed.
Gosh, you two are so in love, the next thing you know, you'll be getting married.
Married?!
That's right. Maaarriiied.
Married...
 Ugh!
'Course, if you're gonna get married, you wanna pick out a really nice diamond for your – ugh! – shmoopy-doopy, uh, pookie-pie.
Diamond!
 Shmoopy!
Don't you think you should start looking for your wedding dress? You'll wanna look your best for your...  honey-bunny snuggle-baby.
Oh! Dress!
Now we just need to keep them apart. I'll keep Miss Cheerilee occupied. You two do the same with Big Mac.
No problem.
Meet you back at the clubhouse in an hour when this whole mess is over.
This one looks nice. Better try it on though.
Ten minutes down, fifty minutes to go.
No.
No.
Not that one either.
No.
Too... shiny. No. You know, somethin' less... shiny.
Mmm.
Miss Cheerilee deserves the best. How much time is left? I'm runnin' out of ways to make diamonds sound bad.
We still have twenty five minutes.
 Where's my brother?
He made his purchase and departed out the back. Said something about needing to see his... shmoopy-shmoo.
Ugh.
Okay, I'll see what I can do to slow him down. You go on to Carousel Boutique and warn Sweetie Belle.
Huh–
What's wrong? Where's Apple Bloom? Where's Big Mac?
On  out of boutique.
Huh?
Move away!
He'll get to her! He's too strong!
Let him go!
Shmoopy-doo– Whoa!
 I sure am glad you found those shovels.
One more minute and the spell will be broken!
Shmoopy-doo!
Sweetums?!
Shmoopy-doo!
Aaaa–
Oh, please be normal, please be normal.
Am I wearing a wedding veil?
Eeyup.
Are you sitting on a feather bed in a hole in the ground?
Eeyup.
Girls! Can you explain why I look like I'm getting married at the bottom of a pit?
We may have given you the teeny-tiniest bit of love potion... that may have turned out to actually be a love poison, and you may have gone just a teeny-tiniest bit nutty.
But we only did it because we thought you and Big Mac would be really happy if you could be each others very special someponies on Hearts and Hooves Day.
Our hearts and hooves were in the right place.
We appreciate that you care about us and want us to be happy but–
But no matter how good our intentions might have been, we shoulda never meddled in your relationship.
Nopony can force two ponies to be together.
It's up to everypony to choose that very special somepony for themselves.
We're sorry.
And you can think about how sorry you are while you're doing all of Big Mac's chores at Sweet Apple Acres. Does that seem like a fair punishment to you?
Eeyup.
Hey there, Miss Cheerilee! What are you doin' here?
Since you three are doing all of his chores, Big Mac and I thought we'd have a picnic at the gazebo. Ready, sugar bear?
Eeyup, pumpkin pie.
 NOOOOO!!!
Let's do this!
Nailed it!
Morning, Daisy Jo! You here to pick up some cookies to go with your milk?
Oh ya, Pinkie, don'tcha know?
Well, Mrs. Cake just baked a fresh batch of your favorite oatmeal.
Mooo, sounds delightful!
Oh, Rose, your Calla lilies look even better than last year! I bet you'll take first prize at the flower show again.
Thanks, Pinkie! Would you like one?
Absolutely!  Looking fit as a fiddle, Mr. Waddle, and you're wearing my favorite tie!
Aw, shucks, Miss Pinkie, you flatterer you.
Well, happy birthday, Cheerilee.
Thank you, Pinkie.
Happy day-after-your-birthday, Zecora!
What a lovely hi, Miss Pinkie Pie!
And Miss Matilda, happy birthday to you... in one hundred and thirty two days!
Pinkie Pie! How do you remember everything about everypony?
'Cause everypony's my friend and I love to see my friends smile!
I've never seen you before.
Kid, you're smarter than you look.
Thanks! I'm Pinkie Pie. What's your name? "Property of C.D.D." I'm guessing that last "D" is for "Donkey".
Quick as a whip, kid.
Now, how 'bout that "C"? Hmm... Calvin? Calhoun? Caleb? Carl? Carmine? Carlo? Charlie? Chester? Chico? Claudio? Cletus? Clifford? Coraline? Cornelius? Cortez? Crank? Christopher–?
Cranky! It's Cranky, alright?!
And your middle name?
 Doodle.
I'm sorry?
 Doodle.
One more time...!
 Doodle.
 So you're a Cranky Doodle Donkey?
C'mon now, Doodle, give a smile!
Nopony calls me Doodle!
What just happened? Meet somepony new, check. Introduce myself, check. Sing random song outta nowhere, check. Become instant best friends... uncheck. I don't get it. How can somepony not become instant best friends with me? Was it something I said? Was it something I sang? This is no time for the blame game, Pinkie! There's somepony new in town, and you need to win him over! 'Try everything you can to make Cranky smile and be your friend'... Check!
Alright, Pinkie. If you're gonna win Cranky's friendship, you're gonna have to bring your A game! Let's do this. Howdy-doody, Cranky Doodle! So, uh, are you moving to Ponyville, Cranky?
What gave you the hint there, kid? The cart full of stuff, maybe?
Well, I'd be happy to show you around. It's the least a new friend can do.
Listen, kid, I traveled around Equestria my entire life. I've made many friends. I don't need any more.
Gosh! I could never have too many friends!
Well, why don't you go and make some more?
But I don't need to go when I can stay and make friends... with you.
Look, kid, y–
Oh, Cranky, you can call me Pinkie. All of my friends do.
Look, kid, I came to Ponyville for some peace and quiet and privacy, to be alone with my memories. All I want is to get to my new home and unpack my stuff.
Ooh, what does this bauble do?
Don't touch that!
Ooooooh, what's this?
Please, don't!
Oooh, look at these!
Eeeheeeheee!
Pinkie! Keep your hooves off my wagon!
Okay, Cranky.  I promised not to touch your wagon, so I brought one of my own! I use it to welcome folks!
Who'd'a guessed?
Maybe we can be wagon buddies! Well, you've gotta at least let me give you the special welcome that comes with it... 
 Let's get this over with.
That's the spirit!
Noooo!
Oh, silly me! I must've put the confetti in the oven and the cake in the confetti cannons! Again!  Mmm, still delicious! Try some, Cranky, it's sure to make you smile.
Oh, where is it, where is it?
Where's what?  Spider! Big hairy spider!
Stop, stop, stop!
Oh. Was that your wig?
I can fix this, I can fix this!  Hey, everypony! Does anypony have a toupee?!
This donkey is really, really, bald!
 What's so funny? This is serious business, everypony! Cranky needs a new wig to cover his hairless head!
I have had enough!
Oh, you're losing him, Pinkie. Wait, Cranky! Please, let me make it up to you!
No!
Please! Oh, please please please... 
Ladies, this is a spa emergency. Cranky needs help, STAT.
Hi, Cranky! I have a gift for you!
The spa treatment was gift enough.
It's not going to explode or anything. Promise. Just open it! It's a new toupee! I had my friend Rarity make it. She calls it the "dreamboat special".
This is wonderful. Thanks, kid.
He's starting to warm up, but still no smile. Hmmm.
Hey! Whatcha doing there, ol' buddy ol' pal?
What's it look like?
Looks like a yard sale. I'll give you two bits for this!
I'm not selling, kid. I'm unpacking.
Well, why didn't you say so?
I thought I had.
This is so pretty! Where'd you get it?
Manehattan. Now put it down, gently.
Really? What were you doin' there?
Trying to find a friend.
Oooh, I'm always trying to find friends, and today I found you. See how good I am at it?
This was a special friend.
Like me?
No, you're extra special, kid.
 Woow, where in Equestria did you get this, Cranky?
Fillydelphia.
It's awfully pretty.
Yes, she was.
Huh?
I mean, it was– I mean, it is. Yes, it's pretty. Now put it down!
I wonder where Cranky got this. Huh. Will you look at that? Hey, Cranky! Can I ask you about–
Oh no!
What did you say-ayayayayay! What have you done?!
There! Uh, all better?
No, not all better, all soggy!
I'm sorry, Cranky!
Oh, you're sorry! Well, then, everything is fine!
...It is?
No! It isn't! Listen to me, kid, I will never be your friend!
Never, or never-ever?
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever!
That's four 'evers'. That's like... forever!
I just can't believe it. Cranky said he would never forever be my friend. It was horrible.
I know this is hard for you, Pinkie, seeing that you're friends with everypony, but you just have to accept that Cranky is gonna be an exception. He just... doesn't want to be bothered.
Yeah, he doesn't want to be bothered by your over-the-top super-hyper antics.
Rainbow!
No, no, it's okay, Twilight. I get what you're saying. What you're both saying. And I guess... I can leave Cranky alone. ...Right after he accepts my apology!
Cranky!
No! No! Leave me alone!
Wait! I understand that you don't want me as a friend!
No, I don't!
So I just wanted to say 'I'm sorry'!
Fine! You said it!
But do you accept my apology?
No!
Oh, Cranky! Please accept my apology! Please!
No!
But I'm really, really, really...
...really, really...
Phew!
...really, really, really... ...really, really, really... ...really, really, really... ...really, really, really, really...  ...sorry!
Cranky, please, please accept my apology! I'd do anything to make it up to you!
But there's nothing you can do! You ruined my book! You destroyed all I have to remember her by!
Her? Her who? The special friend?
Go away, Pinkie! 
 Cranky? It's me again. I understand that you don't wanna be my friend or accept my apology... Before I leave you alone forever, I have something to at least try to make up for ruining your book.
No, I don't want it, kid! Anything you would give me is sure to lead to some sort of disaster!
 Goodness, you really are cranky.
It can't be... Is it really you?
It can, and it is.
Matilda! But how?
Pinkie.
But... I never told you about her!
You didn't have to. I put two and two and two together and it added up to Matilda.
What?
Well, when you were talking about your souvenirs, you said something about trying to find a special friend! And y'know, I wasn't just born yesterday. Nuh-uh! My birthday isn't for another seventy five days!
Huh?
And then, in your scrapbook, there was a flower, an old ticket, and a menu from the Grand Galloping Gala! And I knew I recognized all these things.
But how could you have ever seen them before?
Because I also have them in my scrapbook.
And I'd seen them in Matilda's book!
Oh, Matilda. The night we met at the Gala was the most magical night of my life.
 I couldn't wait to see you again. But when I came to your room the next day, you were gone.
 Didn't you get my note?
 No, I never got it. Ever since that day I've gone from town to town to town, searching all over Equestria for you...
...Until finally I gave up. I came to Ponyville to retire from my search.
I was living in Ponyville the whole time. I always hoped that some day you would come and find me... Doodle.
Uh. Matilda? Nopony calls him Doodle.
Nopony... but Matilda. Mmm.
Oh, Doodle, I'm so happy to see you. 
So does this mean that you accept my apology?
Yes, Pinkie, I accept your apology, and I am honored to call you my friend.
 party! Oh, I have to throw you guys a big party! It'll be called the 'Welcome to Ponyville/I Found My Lost Love/I'm BFF's with Pinkie Pie' Party! ...Or maybe something less over-the-top and not so super-hyper.
Pinkie, we're eternally grateful to you. But... Matilda and I just want to spend some time together in peace and quiet.
Oh. Um, but we're still friends?
Pinkie, you went way, way, way out of your way to make me happy. Of course we're friends.
Great!
Dear Princess Celestia,
Lunch time! Who's hungry?
Plenty for everypony. Slow down, sweetie. 
Here you go, Angel bunny.
Okay, Mister Picky-pants, you win. Carrots, lettuce and apples, yum-yum-yum!
What? But... Well then, what will you eat? I'm not sure I can even make that. Well... I don't want you to starve... Oh, are you sure I can't tempt you with a nice crisp piece of–
 I'll make your special recipe.
Hmm, let's see. Asparagus. Excuse me, um, I think you just stepped in front of me? Excuse me, I think you made a mistake? You see I was actually here first and–
Sorry, didn't notice you there.
I know.
Oh, pardon me, sir–
Yes, what?
I think you just cut in front of me.
A cut of celery? But– this is the asparagus stand!
I said  I think you just cut in front of me.
Ohoh, no need, dearie, I'm already in front!
I noticed.
 ...And I was like, 'Oh, wow.'
Hey!
Would you mind moving back? You're in my personal space.
But–
Seriously, do you need your asparagus so badly? Get a life.
Oh, okay. There's no rush.
Fluttershy, you mustn't let them treat you that way.
Oh, it's-it's really no big deal...
It's bigger than big. It's double big. You are a pony with a problem.
What problem? Oh, go right ahead, Pinkie Pie. You first.
Right there! That's the problem.
You've got to stop being such a doormat.
A doormat?
A pushover, darling. You've got to stand up for yourself, promise us.
Oh, okay. I promise. Oh! Good!
Oh, that's okay, I don't mind.
Watch and learn. Hold it right there, Mister small and handsome.
Uh, who, me?
Oh, of course you. Nopony ever called you handsome before?
Uhh, that'd be a big no.
Oh, well, they should! How about flexing some of your muscles for me?  Oh, my heavens! Do you think a strong, handsome stallion such as yourself could give my friend the last asparagus?
 Nuhh.
See, that's not so hard, is it?
Um... I guess not.
Alright then! What else is on your list?
Let's see... I also need tomatoes.
Here you go.
 That'll be two bits. Not one.
Oh, but last week, it was only one bit.
That was then, this is now.
Oh, okay. I don't wanna argue about it.
What do you think you're doing?
Mindin' my own business, maybe you should try it.
Two bits for tomatoes is outrageous. One bit is the right price.
I say it's two bits.
One bit.
Two bits!
One bit!
Two bits!
One bit!
Two bits!
Two bits!
One bit!
Two bits!
One bit!
I insist it's two bits or nothing!
One bit and that's my final offer!
Have it your way, one bit it is!
See? Asserting yourself can be fun!
I guess you're right!
So, Fluttershy, do you feel like giving it a try?
Um... okay.  Boy, am I glad you have one cherry left. You see, I'm making this special meal for my bunny Angel. He's a very picky eater, and the recipe calls for a cherry on top.
Here you go.
So, you say you need this cherry 'very badly'.
Oh, yes, I'm desperate for it!
Then it'll be ten bits!
Ten?! Oh, hey, mister handsome, I know you wanna do the right thing because you're handsome and strong, and big, handsome, strong guys are always nice to everypony, right?
Ten bits for the cherry.
Ten bits for one cherry's outrageous! I insist on paying you... eleven bits!
Eleven bits?
Umm...I mean, nine bits!
Er, now wait a minute.
Okay, twelve bits, but that's my final offer!
I think you're confused.
It's twelve bits, take it or leave it.
Okay, I'll take it!
Don't give him your money! One cherry is not worth twelve bits!
But... I was only doing what you did.
It was a valiant effort, but you should refuse to give him your business and just walk away.
But... I can't let Angel starve! He won't eat it unless I make it just right! I need that cherry no matter what it costs!
In that case, twenty bits!
Twenty?! Oh, but, I don't have that much!
Then why're you wasting my time?
I'll give you two bits for that cherry!
Sold! Eh, tough break, kid. Next time, don't be such a doormat.
Ta-da! Here you go, Angel. Sorry there's no cherry on top, but the rest of it is exactly what you wanted. Angel?  Look at me... I really am a doormat. "The incredible Iron Will turns doormats into dynamos. Assertiveness seminar today, hedge maze centre." As Celestia is my witness, I'm never gonna be a pushover again!
Oh! Ah! Uh... excuse me! 
 Welcome, friends! My name is Iron Will, and today is the first day of your new life! I wanna hear you stomp if you're tired of being a pushover!
Stomp if you're tired of being a doormat!
Stomp if you wanna pay nothing for this seminar!
That's no joke, friends. Iron Will is so confident that you will be one hundred percent satisfied with Iron Will's assertiveness techniques, that if you are not one hundred percent satisfied, you. Pay. Nothing. But I pity the fool who doubts Iron Will's methods! You don't doubt me, do you?
Uh-uh, no sir...
That, my friends, is your first lesson. "Don't be shy; look 'em in the eye."
Now, to demonstrate that Iron Will's techniques will work for anypony, I'm gonna need a volunteer.
You in the back row!
Who, me?
Yes, you! Iron Will wants you onstage!
 Uh, well...
Now!
 Okay.
Whoaa! He's blocking your path. What are you gonna do about it?
Um, politely walk around him?
No.
Gingerly tip-toe around him?
No!
Go back home and try again tomorrow?
No! "When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!"
Oh! Sorry.
Don't be sorry! Be assertive! "Never apologize when you can criticize."  why don't you watch where you're going!? Now, you try.
Uh... next time, get out of the way before... I bump into you, 'cause... I totally won't be sorry when I do!
You see my friends!? If my techniques can work for this shy, little pony, then they can work for anypony!
Okay, I feel good. I feel ready to "attack the day", as Iron Will says.
Excuse me, Mr. Greenhooves, but I-I think you might be over-watering my petunias...
...again.
Let the professional handle it. 
"Treat me like a pushover, and you'll get the once over."
Hm? Hmm...  Well, perhaps that is enough water.
Thank you.  I can't believe it worked!
Showpony business is tough.
Go ahead, try one of your jokes out on me. I laugh at everything.
Okay, okay, okay. A donkey and a mule are stuck on a desert island...
 Excuse me? Would you mind moving your carts so I can pass?
Yeah yeah, in a minute, I just wanna finish up this story. And so the donkey says to the mule–
A-hemmmm, can you move? You're blocking my path.
Yeah yeah, in a minute! So the donkey says to the mule...  (Why don't we build a boat to get off this island?)
"When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!"
...and the mule says–
Ugh! Easy does it, lady. We're moving, okay?
Good!
Who's next please? And what can I get for you today?
What do you think you're doing?! Didn't you see me?
Uh, I guess maybe.
'Maybe'? "Maybes are for babies!"  Now go to the back of the line where you belong!
Heyyy, look at you!
Oh, your attitude is so feisty, it's fabulous.
Looks like that monster's workshop really paid off!
Iron Will's not a monster. He's a minotaur, and a true inspiration. His techniques really work.
Well, they've certainly made a difference in the way you carry yourself. You truly are a whole new Fluttershy.
Yes I am. And new Fluttershy feels pretty stoked about new Fluttershy.
Well, old Pinkie Pie feels really proud of new Fluttershy. Proud as pink punch. Want some? 
"You laugh at me, I wrath at you!"
Bye, girls. What a day. Taxi! Oh no you don't. "Cut in line, I'll take what's mine!"
Aieeeeee! Ow...
Nopony pushes new Fluttershy around!  Nopony!
Old Pinkie Pie is not so sure new Fluttershy is such a good idea after all.
Old Rarity agrees.
You got this, new Fluttershy! This day is yours! And nopony's gonna take it away from you! Am I right?! Right! What?! He's delivered the wrong mail, again!
Oh–
And new Fluttershy does not want the wrong mail delivered to her cottage.
Ohh, did I mix 'em up again? Sorry about that.
"You apologize, I penalize!"
Oh!
Excuse me, do you know how to get to the Ponyville tower?
Oh, that's a shame.
 "You make me lose, I blow my fuse!"
Hey!
Fluttershy! What are you doing?! That's no way to behave!
Didn't you see what he did to new Fluttershy? And he thought new Fluttershy was a pushover!
No, sweetie, he didn't. We saw the whole thing. We think that you've taken your assertiveness training a little too far.
What?! You just want new Fluttershy to be a doormat like old Fluttershy! But old Fluttershy is gone!
New Fluttershy? Old Fluttershy!?
What happened to nice Fluttershy? We want that Fluttershy back.
No, you want wimp Fluttershy. You want pushover Fluttershy. You want do-anything-to-her-and-she-won't-complain Fluttershy!
Nyaaaaah! Too many Fluttershys to keep track of! Make it stop!
Things getting too complicated for your simple little brain, Pinkie Pie?
Now, stop right there! Let's not let things descend into petty insults!
Why not? I thought 'petty' was what you're all about, Rarity. With your 'petty' concerns about fashion.
Hey, leave her alone! Fashion is her passion!
Oh, and what are you passionate about? Birthday cake? Party hats? I can't believe that the two most frivolous ponies in Ponyville are trying to tell new Fluttershy how to live her life when they are throwing their own lives away on pointless pursuits that nopony else gives a flying feather about!
 Looks like nasty Fluttershy is here to stay!
 I cannot believe what that monster Iron Will has done to you!
Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur!  I'm the monster.
 Fluttershy, are you in there?
It's Pinkie Pie and Rarity!
 Go away! Go away before nasty Fluttershy strikes again!
Oh, sweetie, we all said things that we regret.
We did?
Shh.
 But don't worry, I'm never coming out of my house again. Everypony will be a lot safer with me and my mean mouth locked away.
 Pinkie Pie doesn't blame you, nor do I. You just received some bad advice from that Iron Will character.
Yeah! He's the one that made you act super-duper nasty. What I mean is, there are other ways to assert yourself besides yelling at everypony.
Yes!  You can stand up for yourself without being unpleasant about it.
I-I'm not sure I can. I'm too far gone. Whenever I try to assert myself, I become a monster.
Oh, sweetie, you're not a monster.
No, but he is.
Iron Will's my name, training ponies is my game.
What a darling little catchphrase.
Your friend Fluttershy loved Iron Will's catchphrases. Word on the street is that she doesn't take no guff from nopony! So, Iron Will is here to collect Iron Will's fee.
Fluttershy is in no shape to deal with that creep!
 I'm sure a big, brave, powerful, and rich monster– I mean, minotaur like you doesn't need that money right away. You can afford to come back later.
Are you kidding? Fluttershy is overdue as it is. Iron Will collects now.
Do something!
We're not even sure Fluttershy is home right now. Uh, she might be off frolicking with some woodland creatures. Uh, why don't you give us some time to track her down for ya?
Iron Will does have some grocery shopping to do. Iron Will will come back this afternoon.
But that's only half a day. We need one full day at least.
Iron Will will delay for half a day and no longer!
A full day!
Half day!
Full day!
Half day!
Half day!
Full day!
We need half a day and no more!
Well, you'll get a full day and no less!
Okie-dokie. See you tomorrow.
Wait, what?
Huh, sounds like the search won't be necessary. Iron Will collects now.
But we had an agreement! You gotta come back tomorrow!
"When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!"
Your payment is overdue, Fluttershy! 
 You were nothing but a doormat, and Iron Will turned you into a lean, mean, assertive machine! Now, pay Iron Will what you owe Iron Will!
Um, no.
What did you say?
No.
Ohhh, I'd hate to be you right now, because Iron Will is gonna to rain down a world of hurt unless Iron Will gets his money pronto! 
As I recall, during your workshop you promised one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed, or you pay nothing. Well, I'm not satisfied.
What do you mean you're not satisfied?! Everypony has always been satisfied!
Well, I guess I'm the first then. But since I'm not satisfied, I refuse to pay. It's as simple as that.
Ohh, are you... sure you're not just a little bit satisfied? B-because maybe... we could cut a deal. I-I mean we're both reasonable creatures, aren't we?
I'm sorry, but no means no.
No means no, huh? Nopony's ever said that to me before. Huh... I gotta remember that one. That's a good catchphrase for my next workshop.
You were amazing, Fluttershy! You totally stood up to that monster!
In fact, you didn't change at all! You were the same old Fluttershy that we've always loved!
The one we missed!
Don't worry, old Fluttershy's back for good. I'm sorry I took the whole assertiveness thing too far. Friends?
Friends.
Dear Princess Celestia,
I want to start our field trip here, in the world-famous Canterlot sculpture garden. That one over there represents "Friendship". All right, my little ponies, this one represents "Victory".
How cool would it be to have that for a cutie mark?
Cool, if you were actually victoryful at somethin'.
That's not a word!
What are you, a dictionary?
Girls! Now this is a really interesting statue. What do you notice about it?
It's got an eagle claw!
And a lion paw!
And a snake tail!
This creature is called a draconequus. He has the head of a pony and a body made up of all sorts of things. What do you suppose that represents?
Confusion!
Evil!
Chaos!
It's not chaos, you dodo!
Don't call me things I don't know the meaning of! And it is too chaos!
Is not!
You're both wrong!
Actually, in a way, you're all right. This statue represents "Discord", which means a lack of harmony between ponies. In fact, you three have demonstrated discord so well that you're each going to write me an essay explaining it.
Now let's go, and I don't want anymore fighting.
It's confusion!
Evil!
Chaos!
Come back here, you! Gotcha! Eww, what is this? Cotton candy?
Wait a second! It's not supposed to rain until tomorrow. You can't just–
You did.
Hey, I didn't tell you to go anywhere!
Rainbow Dash, what's going on with this rain? I mean chocolate milk? I mean chocolate milk rain?!
There's crazy weather all over Equestria! Cloudsdale is getting soaked by a major cola storm right now! But don't worry. I'm not leaving you until I get control of Ponyville!
Why would you wanna stop this? 
Ahem. I heard about your troubles, Applejack, and I came to see if there's anything I can do without getting wet. Or dirty. Or out from under my umbrella.
Fluttershy! Do somethin'!
Now, Angel, you really shouldn't– No! It's not possible! I must be seeing things!
Don't worry, everyone. I've learned a new spell that'll fix everything.
My fail-safe spell... failed. What do we do?
Uh, give up?
Spike, Twilight will come up with something.
Hmm, time for plan B. Rainbow, can you corral all those clouds in one corner of the sky?
Applejack, I need you to bring those high-strung storm clouds down to Earth.
Hey, what happened?
Oh dear. I hope none of the animals see these delicious chocolate-filled cotton candy clouds. I'd hate to have to share them.
You and me both, sister! Hey!
And when y'all are done with that, feel free to have some popcorn for dessert.
You see, Spike? You should never give up. There's nothing we can't overcome if we all work together.
 Come on, girls. Princess Celestia wants to see us all in Canterlot immediately!
Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could!
Thank you, Twilight. Thank you, all.
Is this about the weather? And the animals' weird behavior? What's happening out there? Why isn't my magic working? Is there–
Follow me.
I've called you here for a matter of great importance. It seems an old foe of mine, someone I thought I had defeated long ago, has returned. His name... is Discord.
Discord is the mischievous spirit of disharmony. Before my sister and I stood up to him, he ruled Equestria in an eternal state of unrest and unhappiness. Luna and I saw how miserable life was for Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns alike, so after discovering the Elements of Harmony, we combined our powers and rose up against him, turning him to stone.
All right, Princess!
I thought the spell we cast would keep him contained forever, but since Luna and I are no longer connected to the Elements, the spell has been broken.
No longer connected?
This is Canterlot Tower, where the Elements are kept inside since all of you recovered them. I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again and stop Discord before he thrusts all of Equestria into eternal chaos.
But why us? Why don't you-
Hey, look! We're famous!
You six showed the full potential of the Elements by harnessing the magic of your friendship to beat a mighty foe. Although Luna and I once wielded the Elements, it is you who now control their power, and it is you who must defeat Discord!
Princess Celestia, you can count on–
Hold on a second! Eternal chaos comes with chocolate rain, you guys. Chocolate rain!
Don't listen to her, Princess. We'd be honored to use the Elements of Harmony again.
Ooh. You can keep the Elements. I'll take that case!
Have no fear, ponies. I have total confidence that you will be able to defeat Discord with these!
Oh, well. If anyone needs me, I'll be outside in the chocolate puddles with a giant swizzle straw.
The Elements! They're gone!
That chamber is protected by a powerful spell that only I can break! This doesn't make sense!
 Make sense? Oh, what fun is there in making sense?
Discord... Show yourself!
 Did you miss me, Celestia? I missed you. It's quite lonely being encased in stone, but you wouldn't know that, would you, because I don't turn ponies into stone.
Enough! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony?
Oh, I just borrowed them for a teensy little while. 
You'll never get away with this, Discord!
Oh, I'd forgotten how grim you can be, Celestia. It's really quite boring.
Hey! Nopony insults the Princess!
Oh, you must be Rainbow Dash, famed for her loyalty, the Element of Harmony you represent.
That's right! I'll always be loyal to the Princess!
We'll see about that.
I can't believe we're wasting our time talking to a tacky window.
The beautiful Rarity, representing the element of generosity, if I'm not mistaken?
So you know who we are, big deal.
Oh, I know much more than that, honest Applejack.
You seem to know our strengths too.
Yes, Twilight Sparkle, and yours is the most powerful and elusive element, magic. Fluttershy's is kindness and Pinkie Pie's is a personal favorite of mine - laughter. 
Pinkie!
 He's standing on your head!
Stop stalling, Discord! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony?
Oh, so boring, Celestia. Really? Fine, I'll tell you, but I'll only tell you my way. To retrieve your missing Elements, just make sense of this change of events. Twists and turns are my master plan. Then find the Elements back where you began. 
Can we go home now?
What do you reckon he meant? Twists and turns and ending back where we started?
Twists and turns... twists and turns... twists and turns! That's it! I bet Discord hid the Elements in the palace labyrinth!
Good luck, my little ponies. The fate of Equestria is in your hooves.
Thanks, Princess. We won't let you down.
W-We have to go in there?
Nope! Dopey Discord forgot about these babies! I'll just do a quick flyover and we'll have the Elements in no time. My wings!
Your horn! My horn! Ahhh!
Give us our wings and horns back!
You'll get them back in good time. I simply took them to ensure there's no cheating. You see, this is the first rule of our game: no flying, and no magic.
The first rule?
The second rule is everypony has to play or the game is over, and I win. Good luck, everypony! 
Never fear, girls. We have each other!
Yeah! Like Twilight said, there's nothing we can't overcome if we all stick together!
All right, girls, let's do this!
Together! 
Stay calm, girls! Everypony head to the middle as fast as you can, and we'll regroup there!
Moving out!
See you in the center.
Yee-haw!
See you guys there!
 What's that? Who's there? Girls!
What in tarnation? Where am I?
Who are y'all?
The keepers of the grove of truth. You may ask us...
...one question...
...past, future or present.
But be warned...
...that the truth...
...may not always be pleasant.
All right then. I don't trust this place worth a hill of beans, but I've got a really bad feelin' about this feller Discord. What's gonna come of this mission we're on?
For the answer you seek...
...go ahead, take a peek.
I hope I never see you again!
Me too!
Fine!
Fine!
It's settled then.
No! Our friendship? Over?!
It can't be true. It just can't!
That just can't be the truth.
When all the truth does...
...is make your heart ache...
...sometimes a lie is easier to take. 
Applejack! Thank goodness! I thought I heard voices over here. Who were you talking to?
I was talking to... uh... nopony! Nopony whatsoever!
What?
Nothing. Come on, uh, we best be going.
Did Applejack just...? Come on, Twilight! Applejack wouldn't lie.
Hey, what gives?
What's the matter, Pinkie Pie? I thought you appreciated a good laugh?
It's different. They're laughing at me.
It's hardly different. Your friends laugh at you all the time.
My friends laugh with me, not at me.
Oh, really? 
No! Stop it!
Stop laughing at me!
Oh, poor Pinkie Pie. And here I thought laughter made you happy.
 Happy? I don't think so.
Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you!
Oh you are, huh? Why? Need a good laugh?
Pinkie? What do you suppose has her so upset? It's not like her.
I didn't notice anything strange about Pinkie.
Weird. Better pick up the pace before the stress of this gets the better of all of us.
I was expecting an audience with the Princess, not outdoor sports. Agh. Oh my...
 Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity. You've found the one thing in Equestria that could rival my face for sheer beauty. What do you think? You like?
Yes... I like very much... No! No, I shan't succumb to such fabulousness. Must... get to the center... to meet... the others.  Mine!
Well, Rarity. It took forever, but it was worth it. Who knew three little gemstones would turn out to be this handsome hunk of a diamond? Now to get you home. 
Rarity! Are we glad to see... Why are you carrying a humongous boulder?
What do you mean, "boulder"? This big beautiful bedazzling rock is a diamond! And it's all mine. Keep your envious little eyes off it! I found it and it's mine fair and square! 
 Oh, wait a minute... Butterflies? Wait! Don't leave me here!
Fluttershy, looks like you've been left behind by your so-called friends, huh?
Oh, no. I'm certain they're doing their best to find me.
Well, it must be so upsetting to know how weak and helpless they think you are.
Not at all. I am weak and helpless and I appreciate their understanding.
Yes... Well, surely it burns you up... I mean, that they're always pointing out your flaws, right?
Not really. In fact, I think I'm awfully lucky to have friends who want me to be the best I can be.
Oh, for goodness sake! You've been kind for far too long, my dear. Time to be cruel. Arrivederci!
Fluttershy! I'm so glad to see a friendly face. This awful labyrinth is getting to everypony.
Grrr...
Aw, boo-hoo-hoo! Why don't you wave your magic little horn and make everything all right?
Uh...
Oh, that's right, you can't. You don't have one.
What is happening to my friends?
And what are you laughing at?
Chocolate milk.
Little help here! Thanks, Twilight.
You're welcome–
But don't get any ideas about my gem! I know where you live.
I've got you now, element.
Oh. I can see why you like these clouds so much. Very plush.
Get off there and put 'em up! Come on! Let's go!
Hey, I'm here to deliver a message.
I've got a message for you too!
Listen closely, this is important. A weighty choice is yours to make: a right selection or a big mistake. If a wrong choice you choose to pursue, the foundations of home will crumble without you.
Cloudsdale? Crumble... without me? No!
That box contains your wings. You can take them and leave the game, or you can carry on aimlessly wandering this maze. Your choice.
Must... find... Rainbow Dash. As a team... we're unstoppable. Rainbow Dash won't let us down.
Well, looky there. Rainbow Dash is flying away. She's abandonin' us.
Now I know that's a lie.  How can it be?
Well, well, well. Somepony broke the "no wings; no magic" rule. 
 I made it for you, Rarity. Why, yes, it is an ice cream house. Chocolate fudge shingles... rocky road garage...
Huh? Twilight?
Oh, hi, Spike!
It's the middle of the night! Why are you pacing like this?
Frankly, I don't know how you can sleep at a time like this!
Three A.M.?
It's awful, it's horrible, it's tragic!
Eh... I don't understand. What's wrong?
Here. Now do you see what's wrong?
We forgot to celebrate Arbor Day?
No, the problem is I just finished planning my schedule for the month, but I forgot to leave time to plan for next month! Don't you see? There's no time in my schedule to put together another schedule! I could move my meeting with the Ponyville Hay Board to the following Tuesday, but then I have to reschedule my lunch with Pinkie Pie, and you know what a nightmare she is with scheduling. This is an absolute disaster. My whole year could be thrown off!
And I woke up from an ice cream dream for this...
Oh, my gosh, I think I did it! If I can find a way to read "The Art of Invisibility Spells" and "Thornhoof's Brief History of Canterlot" at the same time, that could leave me a half-hour scheduling window! Huh?
What's going on? 
Twilight, you've got to listen to me!
Who are you? I mean, you're me, but I'm me too. How can there be two me's? It's not scientifically possible. You are not scientifically possible!
Twilight, please! I have a very important message for you from the future!
You're from the future?!
That's right, now listen–
What happened to you? The future must be awful.
Please! I don't have much time!
Is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something?
Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning, but that's not important right now!
I can't believe time travel is really possible! How did you, I mean, I figure it out?
The time spells are in the Canterlot archives. But that's not–
Really? Where? I've never seen them.
They're in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing. Now, you have to listen to–
Is time travel fun, or does it hurt? I have so many questions– 
I have something extremely important to tell you about the future, and I only have a few seconds, so you've got to listen! Whatever you do, don't–
Future Twilight? Oh no! What was she trying to warn me about? Her clothes, her mane, that scar... Oh, what a mess she is! ...I mean, I am... or I will be... 
C'mon, Fluttershy! The party can't start until the party supplies get there!
 Happy to... help... but... can I carry... the balloons next time?
Oh!
Listen, everypony! I've got something really important to say!
This is no laughing matter! We have a crisis on our hooves!
I've just been visited by myself from the future!
This isn't a joke! My future self tried to warn me about a horrible disaster that's going to occur sometime before next Tuesday morning!
What kind of disaster?
I don't know! I got sucked back into the future before I could explain!
Run for your liiiiiiiife!
What ever should we do, Twilight? How do we stop the disaster if we don't know what it is?
We'll just have to work together to make sure we're safe. Rainbow Dash, you and the other Pegasi spread out over Equestria, and look for any kind of problem that could lead to a disaster, and I mean anything.
You got it!
Everypony else–
Everypony else, time to disaster-proof Equestria!
Eeyup.
Done, and done, and done. Applejack, what about the Everfree Forest?
The perimeter's clear.
Great.
And my team gave the all clear from Fillydelphia to Las Pegasus.
Excellent. Well, we've done everything on the list, but still... Future Twilight looked like she'd been through a horrible ordeal. I just have this nagging feeling we should be looking for something bigger than loose bolts and leaky pipes.
Okay, everypony, follow my lead. 
What is that thing?!
That's Cerberus! He's supposed to be guarding the gates of Tartarus. But if he's here, then all the ancient evil creatures that have been imprisoned there could escape and destroy Equestria!
Destroy Equestria?!
Yeah! Isn't it great? Hey, Cerberus! You look like you could use some obedience training! Magic obedience training!
Huh?
Who's the cute widdle three-headed dog?
Wow, I knew you were good with animals, but this is amazing!
Aww, he's just a big furry guy who got out of his yard, that's all. Right, Cerberus? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?
Pinkie.
 Yes, Twilight?
Do you have a ball I can borrow?
I have balls stashed all over Ponyville, in case of ball emergency.
 Hey, Cerberus! Look what I have!
I'll be back as soon as I've returned him to the gates of Tartarus. Once he's back at home, there'll be no disaster.
 I wish Twilight would go on epic adventures more often. Best night's sleep I've had in weeks.
Hey, Twilight. How'd it go with Cerberus?
Great. I got him back before any of the evil creatures could escape.
Hurrh... hu– 
 Oh no!
What's the big deal, it's just a 'lost dog' flyer. I guess the Princess hasn't heard we found Cerberus yet.
It's not that, it's this!
A paper cut? Come on, Twilight, you really need to toughen up. Just clean it out and you'll be fine.
The cut's in the exact same spot as the scar on future Twilight's cheek! We haven't changed the future at all! The disaster is still coming!
If the disaster wasn't caused by Cerberus getting loose, then what could it possibly be?
 I dunno, but maybe you ought to give the pacing a rest. You've worn a groove into the floor!
I don't have time for another one of your lectures, Spike! This is serious!
My lectures?
I did everything I could think of to change the future. But it didn't work. So maybe it's not what I do... Maybe it's what I don't do!
Huh?
If I stand right here and don't move a muscle until next Tuesday, I can't possibly do whatever it is that future Twilight wanted to warn me not to do!
Really? So... no matter what happens, you're not gonna move a muscle, huh? Then maybe you won't mind if I... eat an entire tub of ice cream!
Mmm! 
 Spike, stop! Think of the stomach ache!
 Stomach ache, huh? That's future Spike's problem.
Hey, Twilight, another Pegasus just got back from Baltimare with an all-clear and–  What's going on? Aren't you gonna stop him?
She sure isn't! In fact, she's not gonna move 'til next Tuesday! She thinks it'll prevent the disaster from happening!
 Hey, Twilight! There's a mouse right behind you!
Wait, wait, wait, let me try! Whoa-oa– 
Oh no!
What happened?
I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to! It was a total accident!
Show me.
Uhhh... I'm not so sure that's a–
Show me! Oh no! This is the same mane cut as future Twilight!
Y'know... it really doesn't look too bad...
I don't care how it looks! It's just another sign that the future hasn't changed! Not doing anything didn't work either! Oh, I wish there was a way to know what was going to happen so I could stop it!
You wanna see the future? I might know somepony who can help!
What's this?
It's Madame Pinkie's place.
Madame Pinkie?
 Do you like my mystical orb of fate's destiny? I just got it. Cool, huh?
Yeah, uh... best one I've seen.
 Look deep into the crystal ball... for soon it will reveal all! Ah, yes, I see something... It is a vision of the future... I see... you, Twilight. You will get a really cool birthday present next year...
Yes, and?
That's it.
Are you sure?
Yep. Cool birthday present.
Pinkie, I need your Pinkie Sense to tell me what the impending disaster is that future Twilight was trying to warn me about!
Oh, my fortunetelling has nothing to do with my Pinkie Sense, silly. It's only good for vague and immediate events.
Like that, see? Where did that even come from?
Lalalalalalala, lalalala... Gosh, I haven't seen Twilight since the flowerpot incident. Hope she still isn't mad. Uhhhh...
Off by point zero two from yesterday. Carry the fifteen... Negative azimuth on the fourteenth moon...
Hey Pinkie.
Twilight's really serious about finding out about that cool birthday present, isn't she?
Who cares? As long as I can keep eating ice cream. Sorry, future Spike.
 Are... you okay?
Ah, Pinkie, I'm glad you're here. Can you help me recalibrate the apertures on the nine-and-quarter catadioptric telescopes?
Sure!
So I was thinking, after I came to see Madame Pinkie and the flowerpot landed on my head—see the bandage? Just like the bandage from the future...
Nice!
I had an epiphany after that flowerpot. Doing things didn't work, not doing things didn't work, and I couldn't predict the future either, so I only had one other choice. Monitor everything.
Makes sense to me!
That way no matter what happens in the future, I'll be ready! I thought I saw something last night in the Horsehead Nebula, but after staring at it for three straight hours I realized, I was wrong!
Three hours? But when did you sleep?
Oh, I didn't sleep. I haven't slept since future Twilight was here. There are only three days left until next Tuesday, I can sleep all I want after that!
You've been awake too long, Twilight.
Yeah. Tuesday's not three days from now, Tuesday's tomorrow!
 Pinkie, did you finish recalibrating the apertures on the nine-and-quarter-inch catadioptric telescopes?
I have no idea!
Ah! My eye!
Don't worry, Twilight, I have eye patches stashed all over Ponyville, in case of eye patch emergency. There! Now you look like a pirate! A sleepy pirate, with a really weird mane cut.
The eye patch...! Another sign! Nearly all the signs have come true! I haven't done a thing to prevent the catastrophe! If Tuesday's tomorrow, and the disaster happens by Tuesday morning, then there's only one solution. I'll just have to... stop time!
 Okay, the Canterlot archives are right over there. Let's move!
Uhh... I don't think we need to sneak around, Twilight. It's not illegal to walk around Canterlot.
 That was close.
I dunno why we have to wear these things, either.
Aren't we wearing them for fun?
 No, there's nothing fun about this!
Oh... Are you sure?
 Focus, guys! The only way to prevent this disaster is to stop time! Time spells are kept in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing, the most secure section of the archives. That's why we're sneaking around!
Awesome! That sounds fun!
 No, it's not fun!
Aww.
I still don't understand how sneaking into the archives is gonna help her find out about her birthday present.
 The coast is clear. Now slowly lift me into the window so we can– AH!
 Let's get this over with.
 Okay, if my calculations are correct, the Star Swirl the Bearded wing should be right... here.
Uh, Twilight?
 What is it, Spike?
Isn't this where we came in?
Cool! Can we climb in the window again? That was super fun!
I don't understand. It's supposed to be right here... How are we supposed to find it now?
Maybe we should ask somepony in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing?
Huh. How'd I miss that? Look at all those priceless magic scrolls. There are more than I ever imagined!
Twilight, the guard!
 What do we do, what do we do?!
Hey, Twilight, haven't seen you in a while. Let me open that for ya.
 Thanks!
Oh no!
Oof!
Oh!
Look! I look just like future Twilight... The last sign has come true!
And that's bad, right?
Come on! It's almost Tuesday morning! The disaster could happen at any moment!
But how do we find the time-stopping spell? There must be a million scrolls here!
I. Don't. Know!
Twilight, it's over! It's officially Tuesday morning.
Nnngh, no! Tuesday morning, the disaster! Incoming!
I dunno, Twilight. I don't see any disasters. Looks like a pretty nice day.
Good morning, Twilight. Love the new hairstyle. Well, happy Tuesday!
Why isn't anypony surprised to see me sneaking around in here?! Is it possible there never was a disaster? That I've just been making myself frantic over nothing?!
I don't get it. If future Twilight wasn't warning you about a disaster, then what was she trying to tell you?
 I don't know. But I do know one thing. I look ridiculous.
Yeah, you do!
And it's all because I couldn't stop worrying and let the future handle itself! Well, not anymore. From now on, I'm gonna solve problems as they come, and stop worrying about every little thing!
That's great! Does that mean there won't be any more late night pacing?
No more late night pacing. If only I had learned this lesson a week ago, we wouldn't have had to go through all this.
Twilight, Twilight, I found something! It doesn't stop time, but it lets you go back in time. It says you can go back once, and it only lasts for a few moments. Does that help?
Pinkie, you're a genius!
Woo-hoo!
Now I can go back and tell past Twilight that she doesn't need to go berserk with worry about a disaster that's never gonna come!
Twilight, you've got to listen to me!
Who are you? I mean, you're me, but I'm me too. How can there be two me's? It's not scientifically possible. You are not scientifically possible!
Twilight, please! I have a very important message for you from the future!
You're from the future?!
That's right, now listen–
What happened to you? The future must be awful.
Please! I don't have much time!
Is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something?
Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning, but that's not important right now!
I can't believe time travel is really possible! How did you, I mean, I figure it out?
The time spells are in the Canterlot archives. But that's not–
Really? Where? I've never seen them.
They're in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing. Now, you have to listen to–
Is time travel fun, or does it hurt? I have so many questions– 
I have something extremely important to tell you about the future, and I only have a few seconds, so you've got to listen! Whatever you do, don't–
–waste your time... worrying... about... Ugh! I can't believe I just did that!
Did you tell her about the cool birthday present?
Remember last week when future Twilight came to warn me about something? That was me trying to warn myself not to worry so much! Now I'm gonna spend the next week freaking out about a disaster that doesn't even exist! Ugh...
Ah, don't worry about it. It's past Twilight's problem now.
 Huh, I guess you're right, Pinkie.
 Ohhh... my stomach... I, I think it's all that ice cream... I thought the stomach ache would be future Spike's problem... but now I am future Spike. Ohh...
Come on, future Spike. Let's get you home.
C'mon, Fluttershy, it'll be fun!
There's nothing fun about dragons! Scary, yes! Fun, no!
But Fluttershy, the great dragon migration happens only once in a generation! Do you really wanna pass up a chance like that?
Now that you put it that way, yes!
Aw, Fluttershy, we just don't want you to miss out.
Miss out on what? Dragons? Big, scaly, fire-breathing dragons?
Well... yeah!
Thanks, but... no thanks!
Look, Fluttershy, I watched that boring butterfly migration with you, so now it's your turn to watch the dragon migration with me! You owe me!
I... said... no!
Yeaagh! Ugh!
Okay, I guess I'll let you off the hook this time.
 I don't see any dragons.
 Me neither.
Me neither neither.
Shoot! You don't think we missed them, do you?
 No, I don't think so. We're just a little early, and I'm glad we are. This way, we can watch every moment of the migration without bringing any unwanted attention to ourselves!
Yoo-hoo! Well?
What do you think? Am I the toast of the trench or what?
 You'll be toast alright, when the dragons see you parading around in that getup.
 You look very nice, Rarity, but could you maybe look nice down here in the trench with us?
Nice is an understatement. I look fabulous! Who says camouflage has to be drab?
 Ahoy, maties! Dragons ho!
Oooh... Ahhhh!
Wow, amazing!
Pfft, pretty lame move. Is that all they've got?
 What do ya think of that 'move', Rainbow Dash? Still think they're lame?
 Uh, not so much. The word 'fierce' comes to mind.
 And 'formidable'.
 And 'super-duper scary'!
Yeah. Us dragons are definitely a force to be reckoned with.
 Yeah, right, Spike. That's one of the scariest aprons I've ever seen!
What's wrong with wearing an apron? You won't be laughing when you spill blueberries all over your scales. Feathers. That's one tough stain!
One tough stain against one lame dragon. 
You leave him alone, Rainbow Dash! Spike's style is unique. He doesn't have to look like other dragons.
Or act like them.
My little Spikey-wikey is perfect the way he is.
I don't act like other dragons?
Oh, not even close!
But why would you want to, Spike?
Yes. You've got something those dreadfully fierce dragons can only dream of.
What's that?
The cutest widdle chubby cheeks! Ooooo!
Cute?! Dragons aren't supposed to be cute! Right?
Oh, sweetie, you are turning the most delightful shade of red. It is most becoming.
Rrrgh!
Oh, isn't he adorable when he waddles off in anger?
Waddle?! Rrrrrggggh!
What am I? Where am I from? Who am I supposed to be?
Uuugh! I don't know! For the last time, Spike, you were given to me as an egg. I don't know who found you or where they found you.
Seriously? That's all you know?
I'm sorry, Spike.
That doesn't tell me anything about who I am! I need answers! I feel like I'm... I'm looking at a complete stranger. Oh!
Oh, Spike. Why don't we do some late-night research? See what we can find out.
Really? You'd do that?
Of course! I'm sure we can find something.
Nothing. Nothing in this one either!
Nothing at all about dragons? This is getting ridiculous!
I know! It's hard to believe, but ponies know next to nothing about dragons. Apparently they're too rare and too scary to try to talk to or study!
I wonder if dragons cry...
Aw, Spike.
It's okay, Twilight. I'm gonna discover who I am if it's the last thing I do!
Yoo-hoo!
Hey, guys!
Waugh!
Good morning!
Ya wanna join us for breakfast?
That sounds great. I'm famished.
Count me out. I've gotta get an early start!
An early start?
Yes! I'm going on a quest of self-discovery! I need to learn what it means to be a dragon! And the only way I'm gonna do that is to join the dragon migration!
What?!?
Spike, that's nonsense talk! I know that you're a dragon, but those dragons mean business! They're big, and tough, and scary...
And I'm small, and meek... and I like to wear aprons. See? This is exactly why I need to spend time with them.
All I'm saying is that you could get hurt.
Darling, this time I really do have to agree with Rainbow Dash. I don't want those big, ugly, nasty dragons to hurt one little scale on your cutesy-wutesy head!
I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind.
Oh, uh, quick, do something! Stop him before it's too late!
Ngh! Hey! Give it back!
Hold it!
Whoa!
Aaagh!
Really?
Don't tell me you think he should go?
Yes, Spike. I couldn't answer your questions. My books couldn't either. I understand why you want to look elsewhere. I truly believe you need to go on this quest. And we have no right to stop you.
I suppose not.
I still say you're nutty, but hey, I've done lots of nutty things.
We know.
 Rrgh.
Well then, I guess this is goodbye, Spike. We can't wait to hear about it when you return.
Yeah, we hope your trip–
Quest.
–your quest answers some of your pesky "Who am I?" questions.
Thanks, everypony. I know it will.
Goodbye, Spikey-wikey!
Go get 'em, big guy!
We have faith in you!
 We're following him, right?
 Of course.
Ugh!
Nngh...
Alright, teenage dragons! Now that's more my speed. And size.
I'm telling you, we'll never pass for a real dragon!
Oh, pish-posh! This costume is fabulous, one of my finer creations.
Shh!  We'll never pass if they hear three voices coming out of one dragon! Now come on, let's go!
Um, excuse me? Uh, hi. I'm Spike.
You sure your name is Spike and not Shrimp?!
No, it's Spike! I'm not, I mean, I'm sure about that...
You look more like Peewee to me.
Hey guys, c'mon, seriously. Leave him alone or he might fly away. That is, uh, if he had any wings! 
You fly in on your mommy's back during the migration?
Not exactly...
No, no, can't you see baby Spike just hatched? I bet he still sucks his claw at night!
No, I haven't sucked my claw in months!
Well, if you weren't just hatched, how come we haven't seen you around before?
Oh, well, y'see, I live in Ponyville and–
Hahaha! Ponyville? That explains it! I knew there was something vaguely pony-ish about you! If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were part pony!
Who, me? I'm not part pony! I'm all dragon, see? Raar!
Or maybe you're a pony in a dragon costume.
A pony in a dragon costume...! 
 Aheh... yeah... hilarious.
Nnh, I am a real dragon!
Oh, yeah? Prove it.
Well... how?
By acting like one! Who's up for a little belching contest?
You think you can beat that, Peewee?
Huh?
From the desk of Princess Celestia. Dear Spike, please te– Ha! Get this, guys! Spike's pen-pals with a namby-pamby pony princess!
 How can he just throw that away?! That letter could be something important!
We can't worry about that now, Twilight. We're here to help Spike!
I know, I know!
There's no reason to disrespect Princess Celestia that way!
Maybe tail wrestling is more your speed.
Uh...
Yeah!
Ready... go!
The winner!
Good old tail wrestling...
We can't let little Spikey-wikey wrestle one of them! He'll get clobbered!
Let's go!  I challenge Spike to a tail wrestle!
Who's this weirdo?
I think he's Crackle's cousin.
BWAAGH!
Oh, that would explain it. Ready? Go!
Spike's the winner!
Nice going, little Spike! Maybe you are a dragon after all!
Yeah! Maybe I am!
Rainbow Dash, I can't believe your silly plan actually worked. Ow.
Alright, who's next?
Getting a little cocky, huh? I like that. So how about you wrestle... him! Go!
Whooooooooa!
So, Spike, you haven't exactly proven yourself as a dragon yet, have you?
But... I get an A for effort?
Huh, maybe. Let's see how you do in this next contest.
Whaaaaa! Oof! Wha! Oah! Oof!
King of the hoard!
This is my chance.
Not so fast!
Oof!
Whoa!
King of the ho- whoa! Oof! Uh! Nuh! Oof!
Looks like this is another fail for you, little Spike. Can't wait to watch you fail at lava cannonball, too.
Whoever makes the biggest lava splash is the ultimate dragon! Geronimo!
Nuh!
 Spike's on his own this time.
Cannonball!
Guh!
What's wrong, Spike? You afraid the lava will hurt your soft pony hide?
Oooh...
Ugh... Was I... that bad?
No, dude. That was awesome! No pony could live through a belly flop like that!  You're one tough little dragon.
Spike, by belly flopping so hard, you have proven yourself worthy. I hereby dub you 'rookie dragon', and will now perform the initiation ritual. Rrrrgh.  Now let's party dragon style!
Man, was that a great party.
Great? Huh, maybe by Ponyville standards. Stick with us, Spike. We still got plenty to teach you about being a dragon.
I'm not going anywhere. The way I feel right now, I could hang out with you guys forever.
Forever?!
Spikey-wikey is going to stay with these awful dragons? Forever?
Oh no, this is terrible!
I should've stopped him back at the library when I had the chance!
No, Rainbow Dash, this is all my fault! I encouraged him to go!
Y'know, Spike, I think you just might be ready for a real dragon raid.
There's a nest full of phoenix eggs nearby, and we're gonna swipe 'em!
Aren't you totally psyched to go on this raid?
Oh yeah, I'm excited. I mean, I'm psyched.
Alright then. Let's fly!
Uh, sorry, guys! I guess I'll meet you back here at the crater! After the whole raid thing's over? We'll totally hang then! Whoahoa!
Oh no, they took Spike! We've gotta go after them!
 Rainbow Dash, stop! We can't fly!
And you're ruining my fabulous costume!
I'm sorry, but we gotta help Spike!
Well, we're just gonna have to hoof it!
Alright, Spike. Since you're our rookie dragon, you get to lure the parents away from the nest.
Heh... Lucky me...
Well go on, then!
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Phoenix! I was hoping I could have a word with you? Um, I'd, um, like to ask you some questions actually...
 We haven't got all day, Spike!
Hey, you bird brains! Come and get me!
What the...
The eggs have hatched.
What do we do now?
We take the hatchlings, of course!
Get 'em!
Ohh... Get them!
 Nnnghh...
Ugh!
Nnngh, they got away! I hate that!
Oof!
Huh, what have we got here? What happened?
They got away! Hey! You stole an egg?
Uh...
Well, I guess the raid wasn't a total waste after all.
Nice going, Spike.
Well, what are you waiting for, Spike? Smash it!
Smash the egg?
Yeah!
Yeah, throw it on the ground as hard as you can!
Yeah! Smash it! Smash it! Smash it! Smash it! Smash it!
No! It's just a defenseless egg, like I was! And I'm not gonna let you hurt it!
What did you say?
I said no.
No one says no to me. 
Nopony's gonna lay a claw on him!
That's right!
Fighting's not really my thing, I'm more into fashion, but I'll rip you to pieces if you touch one scale on his cute little head!
Ooh, scary, hehe! Spike, are these namby-pamby ponies your friends?
Yes, they are. And they're better friends than you could ever be. Now, if you don't back off, you'll see what us ponies do when confronted by a huge group of jerky dragons.
Oh, yeah?  What's that?
Run away!
Nyuh!
Phew, that was a close one. Thanks, you guys.
Of course. What are friends for?
You're more than friends. You're my family.
Dear Princess Celestia,
Aww.  Hey, welcome to the family, Peewee! Stick with me. I've got plenty to teach you about being a pony.
Calling all Pegasus ponies! Meeting tonight!
 "Mandatory meeting for all Ponyville Pegasi."
Library, tonight. Be cool or be mule. No offense.
None taken.
All right, go on in, find a seat. Ohh... You too, Fluttershy. Come on, let's go.
Every living thing depends on the life-giving nourishment of rainwater, and it is up to Cloudsdale to provide rain-filled clouds to every corner of Equestria. But how, one pony might ask, does Cloudsdale gather all this extra water? Tornado power! That's right, Pegasi-driven tornado power. A team of Pegasi combine their wing power to create a jumbo tornado, powerful enough to pull water out of the local reservoir and funnel it all the way up to Cloudsdale. Remember, Pegasi, your jumbo tornado must reach a minimum of eight hundred wing power to lift that water up to Cloudsdale. So, the next time you're wondering "Where does all that extra rainwater come from?", just remem–
Uh... intermission?
So, here's the scoop. Cloudsdale has chosen our own highland reservoir as a source of the rainwater they need for all of Equestria. And you know what that means. It means it's up to Ponyville's Pegasi to bring that water up to Cloudsdale.
Not only that, but Spitfire, captain of the Wonderbolts, will be here to oversee the water transfer and record our top tornado windspeed. Now last year, Fillydelphia broke the windspeed record with a top speed of nine hundred and ten wing power. But I think we can do better. I think we can get a top speed over a thousand!
...if each and every pony trains, and trains hard to get their wing power numbers up.
That coughing better be from a popcorn kernel, Thunderlane. Nopony's getting sick on my watch. So, are we gonna train hard?
Yeah!
Are we gonna be strong?
Yeah!
Are we gonna be fast?
Yeah!
Record-smashing fast?
YEAH!
Who's with me?
Woo-hoo! 
Fluttershy!
Stretch those glutes, Flitter! Nice flexibility, Cloudchaser. A... little too much flexibility, Blossomforth. Uh, somepony give Blossomforth a hoof. Let's see some faster trotting, Thunderlane! Good pace, Silverspeed!  Keep it up! We're gonna need all the wing power we can get to break that record!
YEAH! 
Good work, everypony!  Everypony except Fluttershy.
 Fluttershy? I know you're in there! You're avoiding tornado duty and I want to know why! Fluttershy, open–
Achoo. Hi, Rainbow Dash. 
Fluttershy, what happened to you?
Oh, I 
Oh, you poor thing. You know, there's only one cure for pony pox.
I know, plenty of bed–
Cold water! Those pony pox are clearing right up.
Oh, y'know, all of a sudden, I'm, I'm starting to feel better.  I'll just get out of these robes and– ow! Oh, my wing, oh, ow, it's hurt. I guess I can't fly after all–
Messed up wing, huh? Stop horsing around, Fluttershy. We've got a lot of training to do. Come on now, what's going on?
Well, y'see, uh, well... Oh, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it! I can't fly!
What are you talking about? Just last week you went into that wicked nose dive to save that falling baby bird right before it hit the ground!
But that was different, that was an emergency! This whole tornado thing, it's more like a performance, and you know how I hate performing in front of others. Don't you remember flight camp? I couldn't gallop hard or fly fast, not with everypony looking at me!
It wasn't that bad.
You're right, Rainbow Dash, it wasn't bad. It was horrible!
 The other foals used to tease me, a lot!
I just can't risk that sort of humiliation again.
Suck it up, Fluttershy! This is no time for– I mean, confidence or no confidence, I'm gonna need every Pegasus to break the record, including you. I need every ounce of wing power I can get.
Oh, I-I don't think so, Rainbow Dash...
 Thanks anyway.
Wait. I'll do it.
You will?
I will.
You're game?
I'm game.
Alright!
What exactly does this machine do?
This is an anemometer. It measures your accelerative velocity and translates it into wing power, thus gauging your cumulative H<sub>2</sub>O anti-gravitational potential. Any other questions?
Yeah.  What exactly does this machine do?
It tells you how fast you're flying and how strong your wings are.
Ohhhh... Okay... I see...
Is that you again, Thunderlane? Please, we need to have a germ-free environment.
It wasn't me, it was Blossomforth.
Don't worry, Twilight. Thunderlane's just cooking up an excuse to spend tornado day in bed. Why don't you get over here and be our first test flyer, Thunderlane?
We have 9.3 wing power.
Wow! That's fast!
YEAH!
Not bad, not bad. 
16.5 wing power!
Now listen up! If each of you can get your numbers up to at least 10.0 wing power by the end of the week, we'll no doubt set a new tornado speed record. We'll be number one!
Impressive. Fluttershy, your turn. 
 Fluttershy, Fluttershy, Fluttershy can hardly fly...
 Tell her!
 No, you tell her!
 No, you!
Um... great job, Fluttershy! You measured, uh, uh, .5.
.5? Isn't that like... less than one?
Ow!
Fluttershy, wait! So some punks poked a little fun at you and you got stage fright, big deal. You aren't gonna go quit just because of that, are you?
 Yes!
But I need you!
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just  don't have the courage right now...
 Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid a couple of little acorns won't solve my big flying problem.
I tried, but you should've seen those ponies laughing at me...
I know it's important to have confidence in myself...
Yes, yes, I do remember. The river was swelling...
...and you were scared...
...yes, I did tell you to never give up... and to believe in yourself. You're right, my friends. I shouldn't give up. I will get my confidence up and show everypony that I am a good flyer! A great flyer!
That's wonderful, Flitter. Much better than yesterday.
This is crazy awesome! We're gonna smash that record!
What did he say?
Do I look like I speak squirrel?
What's that?
2.3? 2.3?! That has to be some kind of mistake! I worked so hard!
Fluttershy, that's a huge improvement!
You did awesome, Fluttershy.
No, I didn't. I thought I'd gotten over my nerves, but they still got the best of me! There's no way I'll fly with 10.0 wing power tomorrow!
So you won't fly with 10.0 wing power. Every bit counts!
How would you feel if everypony else was flying with 10.0 wing power and you were flying with 2.5?
Actually, it was only 2.3, and– ow!
Well, uh... I'd feel... um...
Exactly! Humiliated!  I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it!
It's okay, Rainbow Dash, you've still got plenty of wing power for your tornado. You'll be able to lift tons of water up to Cloudsdale!
 If only there was a way to lift Fluttershy out of the dumps.
Are we ready to do this?
Yeah! 
Look!
Lazy Thunderlane! Where is he?! He's been trying to get out of tornado duty the whole time with his fake coughing and all. Rumble, where's your lazy brother?
He's got the feather flu. He's down at Ponyville Hospital.
But he's not the only one.
Let's see, with those eight sick Pegasi out with the feather flu...  Oh no!
Don't tell me we won't be able to break the windspeed record?
No...
Phew!
...You might not have enough wing power to create a tornado powerful enough to lift the water to Cloudsdale!
Well, should we pack up?
No. Of course not. Forget the record. Cloudsdale still needs water! Okay, everypony! Let's give it all we've got! On the sound of the horn, we take off!
You think they're gonna make it to eight hundred wing power?
I sure hope so! One hundred and fifty wing power. Two hundred and fifty wing power. Five hundred wing power!
Seven hundred and fifty wing power!
Twilight!
Fluttershy! What are you doing here?!
I figured... if I couldn't help Rainbow Dash with the tornado... the least I could do was offer moral support!
She could sure use it, considering eight Pegasi are sick with the feather flu!
Oh no! That's terrible news!
Whoa! 
Yaa– oof!
Are you okay?
 I'm fine!
Oh, you were so close to the eight hundred wing power minimum! I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash.
Rbbbb– We've got to try again!
But you've pushed your crew to their limit already!
If you break apart again, somepony could get hurt! You should quit, it's not safe!
No! One more time! I've gotta know we gave it our all! If I'm going down, I'm going down flying! C'mon, ponies, let's make this happen!
YEAH!
Okay, here we go... One hundred wing power! Two hundred! Five hundred!
Stay in position! Flap those wings! Faster!
Seven hundred! Seven hundred and fifty wing power!
 They fell apart right after this!
Oh, I'm too nervous to look!
C'mon! Just a little harder! I can see the water trying to funnel through!
Seven ninety five! We are so close! Fluttershy, they need you up there!
I won't make a difference!
You can make a difference!
My measly 2.3 wing power is still too little!
It's sticking at seven ninety five! I don't know if they've got any more in 'em!
Do it for Equestria! Do it for Rainbow Dash! Do it for yourself!
It's moving! She's doing it! Seven ninety eight! She surpassed her best wing power number!
No!
What was that?
I think it was Fluttershy!
She did it! She did it! They all did it!
Whoa, girl, take it easy!
Whuh, what? Did we do it?
Yeah, we did it! You did it!
Ah!
Great job, Fluttershy, that was awesome!
Yeah, we couldn't have done it without you.
Nice job, Rainbow Dash. You may not have set a new record, but you showed a lot of guts.
Thanks, but if you wanna talk guts, then you've gotta give it to my number one flyer, Fluttershy! Let's hear it for Fluttershy!
Dear Princess Celestia,
Can you believe Featherweight got his cutie mark? Featherweight! Before us!
Great cutie mark, Featherweight!
 Looking good!
I give up...
I've got it! The answer to all our problems!
The Foal Free Press? How's the school paper gonna get us our cutie marks?
Move your caboose!
Uh-oh. That's Granny Smith. Gotta run!
Maybe there's something to this newspaper idea.
Guess it's worth a shot...
Apple Bloom. Your newspaper idea was nothing but a big bust.
We tried everything, from papier-mâché to making birds' nests, and nothing worked.
What's so funny?
What I meant was, we should write for the paper! We can get our cutie marks as journalists!
Okay, class, see you tomorrow! Oh, for those of you who want to join the newspaper staff, stay here, because we're meeting right now!
Cutie marks in journalism!
Such a good idea.
Welcome, everypony. Now, as you know, our editor-in-chief graduated last year–
Oh, oh, oh, ohohohoh!
Yes?
What's an editor-in-chief?
Good question, Sweetie Belle. I like those reporters' instincts. The Foal Free Press is a student-run paper. I'm only involved as an adviser, so the editor-in-chief is the pony in charge, from choosing the stories to making sure it gets to press on time. Now, as I said, we have a new editor this year!
Diamond Tiara?!
Hm.
I'll leave you alone now to discuss everypony's assignments. Have fun!
Alright, listen up. The Foal Free Press is a joke.
Huh?
Nopony at this school takes it seriously. Well I, the editor-in-chief in charge, am going to deliver us to newfound glory!
Yay!
First things first. Where's the staff photographer? Get out there and document everything. I'll decide what's important.
The rest of you, I want hard-hitting news and interesting think pieces. No more Namby-Pamby stories like last year's editor.
But Namby-Pamby was a great editor.
Well, there's a new regime now, and I want juicy stories. The juicier, the better! Now get out there and report!
Let's get out of here, girls. Maybe we can try packing boxes again.
But this could be our last chance to earn our cutie marks! If we really are supposed to be journalists, isn't it worth a little grief?
I guess you're right. We can take a little bit of Diamond Tiara for a lifetime of cutie marks.
C'mon! Let's go get these marks!
 My first story's going to be an exclusive interview.
 I saw a brand new nest of baby birds the other day. I bet our readers would eat up a sweet story like that!
 Granny Smith has all sorts of great stories! I reckon I'll do a piece on the history of Ponyville.
I hope you've got something, because everything so far is unusable. "Baby Birds Born"? "Rarity's Hot New Hat"? "Ponyville: The Early Years"!? Oh! I don't know what you call this, but it sure isn't news!
We just... thought...
Get something else on my desk by the end of the day, and it better be juicy!
Now what? Do you know what I had to do to get that story?
Oh, you don't even wanna know what I had to sit through.
Oh! Get it off me, Snails!
Eh, you get it off me, Snips?
Aah! Stop it! You are making it worse! Nah! Oh, great.
I'll get it. 
Aah!
Get it off! Get it off!
 Take a few pictures of this, then meet me during lunch. Girls, I have our story.
"Snips and Snails in Bubblegum Veils! And that's when the biggest jokester in school really stuck his hoof in it – literally!"
The Foal Free Press is usually just boring news and stuff.
So funny!
Our mothers always told us we'd end up in the papers someday.
Yeah, and look! We finally got the gum out! 
Your column is a sensation! I don't want you doing news anymore. I want more columns like this. Columns about ponies and their private lives, the things they do when they think they're alone. You three are my new gossip columnists! And I love the way you signed it! "Gabby Gums"...  That was a stroke of genius!
We couldn't fit all of our names, so we decided to create one for all three of us.
Well, I want more Gabby Gums! Nice work, girls.
But we sure seem to have a gift for gossip.
If we can write a few more of these Gabby Gums columns, we'll earn our cutie marks for sure!
Woo-hoo!
Scootaloo? Do you have anything?
Nope.
Apple Bloom?
 Sorry.
Let's face it, nothing very juicy happens at this school.
We're doomed.
Ohh, Sweetie Belle... Was she raised in a barn or something?  Too rich!
Can you please keep it down with all the laughter? I'm trying to– hey!
Bleh! I, I was just–
Are you snooping through my saddlebag?
How dare you!
Oh, but this Gabby Gums column is so funny!
You actually like the school paper?
It's so much juicier than anything in the boring old Ponyville Express. Could I borrow this to show my friends?
Your friends would wanna read the Foal Free Press?
Oh, they'd just love Gabby Gums! Who is she, anyway? I've never heard of her before. Is she a new–
We gave up too quickly, girls. Forget trying to squeeze stories out of this school. We need to expand!
We can find all kinds of great gossip out there in Ponyville!
We'll need to tell Featherweight to start working overtime.
Sweetie Belle, you're a genius!
"Pound and Pumpkin Cake Trip to the Store Ends in Tears." Gabby Gums comes through again!
 The Ponyville news stand wants to carry the Foal Free Press! Ponies keep coming by and asking for it!
Send 'em twenty copies, and if they run out of those, we'll send 'em twenty more! You three are doing a great job for this paper. Keep those columns coming!
This is great!
Oh, this is the life, isn't it, girls? The best hooficure I've ever had!
 You said it, ooh...
 I don't know if I've ever been so relaxed.
You guys!
Aaah!
The new Gabby Gums just came out! "The Great and Powerful Trixie's Secrets Revealed!"
We already read that one, Rainbow Dash. Come on, relax, have a hooficure, it feels amazing.
 Did you forget who you're talking to? The day I get a hooficure is the day I turn in my daredevil license. Besides, I haven't read this Gabby Gums yet.
Well, do it quietly, will ya?  Some of us are trying to unwind!
I like Gabby Gums too, but don't you think she can be a little mean?
She's not mean, Twilight, she's a hoot!
"Celestia Just Like Us"? Gabby Gums doesn't value anypony's privacy.
Oh, lighten up, Twilight, there's nothing but harmless gossip!
Yeah, Twilight, I mean listen to this one. "Mayor Not Naturally Gray!" The Mayor in a mane dyeing scandal? Who wouldn't wanna read that?
I just can't help feeling sorry for the ponies featured in her columns. It's gotta be a little embarrassing.
Are you kidding? Do you know how awesome it is to get your name in the paper?
Rainbow, why don't you join me in one of these delicious hooficures?
It's that good, huh? Well, maybe just one little hoof.
 Forget it, I don't like ponies touching my hooves. Man... I'd love it if Gabby Gums did a story on me.
She did one on me.
What?!
Aaaah!
"Exclusive! Local Dragon Tells All! Spike opens up about Canterlot, naps, and his favorite jams!"
It's our best column yet!
More like your worst column yet! Gabby Gums didn't become the biggest thing in Ponyville with namby-pamby stories like this!
 Yeah, she's right. This column is a little softer than our usual gossip.
Were you guys feeling guilty about all the gossip too? Like... maybe we could be hurting other ponies' feelings?
Yeah, I didn't wanna say anything because everypony loves Gabby Gums so much, but... I was sorta hoping we could start writing more stories like this one.
Me too.
If we're gonna get our cutie marks, we've got to give the ponies what they want.
Awww...
"Applejack Asleep on the Job!" Can y'all believe this?! And this one: "Big McIntosh – What's He Hiding?" Who the hay does this Gabby Gums think she is?!
Listen to this one. "Twilight Sparkle: I Was a Canterlot Snob. A well-placed scaly source close to the prissy pony says Twilight Sparkle thinks Ponyville is nothing but muddy roads and low-class rubes." Spike!
How could you say such a thing?
Well, I didn't! Gabby Gums made that up! I never said anything like that!
Everypony, please! She's just a harmless schoolpony engaged in a little harmless gossip. You're really making too big a deal out of this.
But it's all lies! Gabby Gums prints whatever she wants! She doesn't care whose reputation she destroys! "Fluttershy Has Tail Extensions!" "Pinkie Pie is an Out-of-Control Party Animal!"
What?! It's true! I do have a problem! 
Oh, look! According to this one, the Cakes are breaking up!
We are?!
 Well, my life is officially over. Gabby Gums has made it to Cloudsdale.
"Rainbow Dash: Speed Demon or Super Softie?"?!
I grabbed as many copies as I could, but it was too late!  I'm a laughing stock!
See, Rarity? Your so-called 'harmless gossip' can be very hurtful!
her! "The Drama-Queen Diaries"... She's reprinted my diary! How could Gabby Gums possibly get access to my private diary?!
We've got to put a stop to this once and for all! Sweetie Belle's on the newspaper staff. Maybe she knows who Gabby Gums is.
 My sister would never associate with anyone as beastly as Gabby Gums! I resent you even suggesting such a thing, Twilight! Why, she's the most innocent, most lovely–
–most evil pony in Equestria! How could my own sister steal my private diary? How could my own sister be... Gabby Gums?
Et tu, Gabby Gums?!
 You know?! How'd you find out?!
The gilded pages of your betrayal!
Oh, yeah.
How could you do this to me?! You stole my secret diary and published it for all the world to read! Gossip can be a very hurtful thing. It is an invasion of privacy, just like when I snooped through your saddlebag. You didn't like that much, did you?
No...
What is important is that you understand how your column makes the ponies that you're writing about feel!
I do understand, and we've all been feeling guilty, but we just want our cutie marks so badly!
Do you really think that writing nasty things and making everypony feel horrible is your destiny?
Well, when you put it that way...
No! I won't let you quit!
But the gossip we've been printing is hurting everypony's feelings!
Feelings?! I don't care about feelings! Gabby Gums is my bread and butter, and I'm not gonna let you goody-two-horseshoes take that away from me!
We're sorry, Diamond Tiara, but we've made our decision.
Yeah, you can't force us to keep gossiping.
When you see these... you may not want to quit after all.
I told Featherweight to document everything...
...And that's exactly what he did.
 Gimme those!
Sorry, girls, property of the Foal Free Press. And if Gabby Gums really does go into retirement, I'll need something to fill that empty column space. Now get out there and bring me more Gabby Gums!
We'll find a way out of this, girls.
Maybe Rainbow Dash will have a story for us. She's always good for some gossip.
Rainbow Dash! Hey, Rainbow Dash!
Well, if it isn't Gabby Gums!
You heard too, huh?
Are you kidding? Everypony in town knows it's you three.
Don't suppose you'd let us write a column on you, huh?
Oh, hi, Angel. Is Fluttershy home?
 Hey, what gives?
A-ha!  Twilight thought you might try to show your faces around here, so she put up a force field.
Aw, c'mon, Applejack! You're not mad at us too, are you?
Eeyup.
You're not even gonna talk to us?
Nnope.
You should be ashamed of yourself, humiliatin' your sister 'n' me like that. We don't wanna talk to any o' y'all right now so take your little gossip column and your embarrassing photographs and just go away!
We've ruined all of our friendships and we still don't have our cutie marks!
This is the worst day ever!
Oh yeah? Wait 'til tomorrow, our most embarrassing moments are about to be published for everypony to laugh at.
So what do we do?
I don't know, but we're not leaving this clubhouse until we think of something!
That's it, Gabby Gums is out of time. Run these instead. I want this paper on every street corner in Ponyville!
Yes, ma'am!
Stop the presses!
Uh... they haven't started yet.
We have a Gabby Gums column!
Hmph, you're lucky I'm nice.
This better not happen again, or else.
 "An Open Letter to Ponyville by Gabby Gums"?! What is this?! Ooh, they're not gonna get away with this! I'll publish those photos tomorrow! They messed with the wrong pony!
To the citizens of Ponyville,
Y'see, I'm actually three little fillies, Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo.
As the popularity of our column grew, we got swept up in the hype. We knew that what we were doing didn't feel quite right, but we ignored the guilt because everypony seemed to want to read what we were writing.
From now on, we promise to respect everypony else's privacy, and we won't engage in hurtful gossip any more.
All we can do is ask for your forgiveness, Ponyville.
Well, staff, I guess I gave a little too much authority to a first-time editor. I'm sorry, Diamond Tiara, I have to strip you of your title. 
And for the next editor of the Foal Free Press...
...here's your new editor-in-chief, Featherweight!
Ugh! Him? But what about me?!
Here ya go! I've been promoted to staff photographer!
Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. You've really outdone yourselves, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. This is sure to be the winning entry of this year's national dessert competition!
Oh, thank you, Pinkie!
And thanks for transporting it all the way to Canterlot for us.
Absolutely! It's my honor and I–
Uh, beg pardon, but could we maybe move things along? This here cake's a mite heavy. Right, Big McIntosh?
 Eeyup...!
Alrighty then, Big Mac! To the train depot! That's it, Big Mac, nice and slow. This is precious cargo you're carrying.
Yes, it took months of planning and testing.
I would hate for it to–
Fall!
Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Cake. Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, a little pegassistance? I'll get it there safely, you'll see!
Ahahah, oh... of course, Pinkie.
We never doubted you.
Twilight, can I see you a second? A nice protective spell as extra insurance.  Better safe than sorry. AJ, Rarity, one last thing? All right, everypony, we're in the home stretch here.
See, Mr. and Mrs. Cake? I got it here without a hitch! Now all we have to do is get it... in?
 Thank you all for helping me get the cake safely on the dessert car.
Thank you for inviting us all to go with you to Canterlot for the National Dessert Competition.
I'm sure the festivities will be just lovely.
Phooey on the festivities! I can't wait to try all those tasty treats!
Well, the tastiest treat of all is sure to be the Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. All that rich creamy goodness of the marzipan, combined with the tart tanginess of the mascarpone, blended perfectly with the smooth, silky sweetness of the meringue. That's why I call the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness the "MMMM".
MMMM.
Exactly. It's the most delicious delectable delightful de-lovely cake in Equestria, and it's sure to win first prize.
Zis is not so, for I, Gustave le Grand, do challenge your crude cake to a duel of delectable delicacies against my exceptionally Exquisite Éclairs! They will undoubtedly strike down all ze competition, winning first prize and crowning me le champion.
Not a chance, le Grand.
Donut Joe! What are you doing in Ponyville?
Picking up the final all-important ingredient for my contest entry, Donutopia! And with these super-sprinkles, my donuts are going to dunk all the other lousy desserts, steal first prize, and make my donut shop famous forever! 
Oh, Joe... 
Hello. What's your name?
I am Mulia Mild. Behold, my Chocolate Mousse Moose. It will trample all your treats, be given first prize, and make me the greatest chef in Equestria.
Madame Mild, you and your mousse moose are mistaken.
Your frou-frou éclairs will never defeat my donuts!
The Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness is going to win!
Your simple cake could never take my moose. 
Well, it sure looks like we're in for a delicious competition tomorrow. Maybe we should all settle in for a good night's sleep.
Hmph.
Nyahh.
Huh! 
 I gotta admit I'm pretty beat.
Yeah, I'm gonna hit the hay myself.
Wait! Didn't you hear those chefs? We have to protect "MMMM".
MMMM?
Mmm-hmmm. I know for super sure that "MMMM" is the best dessert in all of Equestria, and I know that they know it too.
So...
So... one of them is going to sabotage the Cakes' cake tonight! You have to help me stand guard!
Pinkie... you're overreacting.
Yeah, those chefs aren't going to do your cake any harm.
But they are! I just know it.
Fine! If you want to stand guard, go for it. We're going to bed.
I'll show them. I'll stay up all night and protect you. Nothing and nopony will stop me from keeping you safe.
Huh? Stop, you saboteur! I have you now! Wha? A-ha! Ahh?! Oh! Thank Celestia you're okay! But one of those bakers is mixing up something bad, so I'm not leaving you again no matter what.
Huh? Who turned out the moon? Don't go near that cake, thief!
Stop, thief!
Oh, are you okay, thief? 
 The cake! Oh, MMMM, you look mmmm-marvelous.
Whoa!
I know. I think some congratulations are in order for a job well done.
Um, you better hold off on giving yourself an award just yet, Pinkie. Look.
Look at what? Huh? 
What is it?
What happened?
It's the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, it's been  mutilated!
Now we just need to find out who done it.
You mean, who did it.
Exactly. Who did-done-dood it.
Well, having read many mystery novels, I know that the only way to discover the culprit is to investigate.
Exactly.
And as chief detective, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Uh, you're investigatin'?
Yes! And Twilight shall be my lowly assistant who asks silly questions with obvious answers.
Fine, Pinkie. Should we start looking for clues?
Perfect silly question, my dear Twilight. Because the obvious answer is...
Yes?
No! 'Cause I know who did it.
Pinkie, how could you possibly know?
How could I possibly not know? Clearly this dastardly deed was done by the baker, who knew their dessert could not measure up to the mastery of the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. I guess you feared your éclairs lacked flair, Gustave!
Thus, destroying the cake and the Cakes' chance of winning the National Dessert Competition.
But it makes no sense!
What do you mean, lowly assistant?
Well, first, if you were tied to the train tracks, how are you now here?
Huh... Guess that isn't a totally silly question.
And second, the cake hasn't been sliced. It's been bitten. Just look at the teeth marks!
Hm... You're right, my fine fellow. Gustave le Grand is clearly in the clear, which means the "MMMM" was destroyed by another baker. A baker who's donuts are do-nots. That's right, it was Joe!
 Or as he's known the spy world, Mane. Con Mane.
Crushing the Cakes' chances to win!
Pinkie! There is no laser beam security system! And Joe is not sleek, stealthy Con Mane! He's big, gruff, and messy!
Hey!
Although, you would look rather dapper in a tuxedo.
Huh... You may be right, lowly assistant.
May be?
Now that I'm taking a closer look at these desserts, I see that one simply cannot look me in the eye.
Pinkie... that moose is a mousse!
Yes, and the mule behind the moose panicked when she saw the mastery of the "MMMM".
So you're saying that the culprit is...
Mulia Mild!
Putting an end to the Cakes' dreams of taking first prize. Huh, I hope you're proud of yourself, Mulia.
Pinkie, stop! This is ridiculous! Look at her!
 I guess you're right...
Thank you!
But I was so sure that it was one of the other bitter bakers that destroyed the "MMMM". That way, their delicious dessert would reign supreme. I mean, just look at Joe's Donutopia. It's a spectacular city of donutty delight, topped temptingly in sprinklicious sprinkles. And Gustave's éclairs look incredibly edible, with glistening glaziness. But then there's Mulia Mild's Mousse Moose.  why, this mouth-wateringly marvelous mousse moose tempts the taste buds with its silky, smooth, yummy-nummy, chocolateyness. So why did this criminal devour the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness while leaving this trio of tasty treats untouched?
 Now I have no idea who do-doned it!
This mystery gets more mysterious every minute.
Well, you have to stop the wild accusations and get to the truth. Everypony go back to your cars while we do a little investigating. Okay, Pinkie, in order to really solve this mystery, we're going to have to find clues. Now you were here at the scene of the crime all night.
Huh! You're not accusing me, are you?
No! But maybe you saw something that will help us.
I saw a silhouette in the moonlight!
Good... Let's retrace your steps.
And then I chased the culprit down the train towards the caboose, but when I got there, he was gone.
Hm... A-ha! Our first clue. I think I know who did it, Pinkie.
Already?
Yes, but I need more evidence to confirm. Tell me what happened next.
I heard somepony else in the dessert car and chased them up to the engine. But when I got there, all I saw was the conductor shoveling coal.
The conductor, huh?  But that doesn't make any sense. What happened next, Pinkie?
Well... I went back to the dessert car.
Yes?
The curtains mysteriously closed, all on their own.
Interesting. Anything else?
I heard hoofsteps, a loud thud...
...and then they were gone! When I opened the curtains, I saw that the portrait by the door was all crooked.
Oh my, what is that?
What next Pinkie?
That's it. I was here guarding the cake the rest of the night. I mean... I slept by the cake the rest of the night.
And when you woke up, half the cake was gone?
Exactly.
By Jove, I think I've got it. Call everypony back. We have a cake culprit to catch.
 Why are we all here again?
I bet you're wondering why you're all here again.
She's good.
We have discovered the true culprit of this cake carnage.
But how?
Well, you see, when committing a crime, it's crucial that one never leaves behind clues, especially an obvious clue like... this.
A-ha! A blue feather! I knew it was you, Gustave le Grand!
Pinkie, Gustave doesn't have blue feathers.
No, 'cause he's been dyeing them!
No, Pinkie. Remember how when you chased the suspect to the caboose, they suddenly disappeared? That's because they flew away. But the thief did leave a little something behind, didn't you, Rainbow Dash?
I-I don't even like cake!
So Rainbow Dash did it! Case solved!
Case not solved, because when we went to the engine, I saw the conductor's hat. And inside the hat was... this.
So it was you! That pink hair came from your rainbow-colored mane!
I don't have pink in my mane, Pinkie!
So you're wearing a wig?
Ow! Cut it out!
Pinkie, remember? You chased a pony to the engine, where you thought you saw the conductor shoveling coal, but that wasn't the conductor at all. It was... Fluttershy!
 Oh my.
You're goin' down, Fluttershy!
Pinkie! But then another clue confounded my suspicions. You were guarding the cake when the curtains mysteriously closed. But that's no mystery, that's magic. But when the thief tried to make their great escape, they left a little addition to the portrait. Has anypony else noticed that Rarity is wearing her hair rather differently today?
 What? Is it a crime to change one's style now and again? Why, I think it's a crime not to.
Really?
Fine, I'm guilty!  I wear false eyelashes! Oh, and I took a bite of the cake.
So did I.
Aw nuts, so did I.
You just made it sound so delectable.
So tasty.
And boy was it!
I only meant to take a little, lady-like bite.
And it was so good.
Yeah, I just dove right in!
But I'm really really sorry.
Terribly sorry.
Sorry, Pinkie.
That's okay. At least this mystery is finally solved.
But it isn't. We figured out who ate the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, but we still don't know who devoured the other bakers' goods.
You're right, Twilight. You know what we have to do?
Well... Yes, I do. Do you?
Look for clues!  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Well, Pinkie. Did you find the devourer of the desserts?
I most certainly did. It was none other than... the bakers!
First of all, Gustave has mousse in his moustache! And Joe has éclair in his hair! And Mulia has sprinkles in her wrinkles!
What do you say, bakers?
Oh, I am so sorry, Mulia, but Pinkie made your mousse moose sound... très magnifique.
And Pinkie's description of your éclairs really did make 'em sound scrumptious.
And the way she spoke of your Donutopia, ohh, was too delectable to resist.
Well, everypony, we finally have the mystery solved.
Yes, but now we don't have any desserts to enter into ze contest!
I think we can fix that. Come on!
Dear Princess Celestia,
How's that for a lesson, Princess Celestia?
Care for a bite?
I don't mind if I do.
Mmmmm.
Ahh!
It is gorgeous out. Just gorgeous!
Twi... light! ...I... have... Lemme just... 
Dear Twilight, I am sure you are as excited as I am about the upcoming wedding in Canterlot.  I will be presiding over the ceremony, but would very much like you and your friends to help with the preparations for this wonderful occasion. Fluttershy, I would like you and your songbird choir to provide the music.
Oh my goodness! What an honor!
Pinkie Pie, I can think of no one more qualified than you to host the reception.
Hip, hip, hooray!
Applejack, you will be in charge of the catering for the reception.
Well, color me pleased as punch!
Rainbow Dash–
...I would very much appreciate it if you could perform a sonic rainboom as the bride and groom complete their "I do"'s.
Yes!
Rarity, you will be responsible for designing the dresses for the bride and her bridesmaids.
Princess Celestia wants me to–  ...wedding dress? For a Canterlot wedding... I, ah, ooh, oooh!
And as for you, Twilight, you will be playing the most important role of all: Making sure that everything goes as planned. See you all very soon. Yours, Princess Celestia. But... I don't understand. Who's getting married?
Oh, wait! Uh, I was probably supposed to give you this one first.
Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and...  My brother?!
Your brother's getting married? Congratulations, Twilight! That's great news!
] Hey, Twilight, just thought you should know I'm making a really big decision that changes everything. Oh, never mind, you'll hear about it when you get the invitation. 
Um, Twilight? Are you okay?
Sorry, it's just that Shining Armor and I have always been so close. He's my B.B.B.F.F!
Big Brother Best Friend Forever?
Ohhh!
Before I came here and learned the importance of friendship, Shining Armor was the only pony I ever really accepted as a friend.{{#lst:B.B.B.F.F.|song}}
As one of your P.F.F.'s...
Pony Friends Forever...
Ohhh!
...I wanna tell you that I think your brother sounds like a real good guy.
He is pretty special. I mean, they don't let just anypony be captain of the Royal Guard.
 So let me get this straight. We're helping out with the wedding of not only a princess, but a captain of the Royal Guard?
I guess we are.
Ooh, ooh, oooh!
A sonic rainboom? At a wedding?! Can you say "best wedding ever"?!
 Best wedding ever!
So you all get to help with the big fancy wedding, but I'm the one who gets to host the bachelor party! I have just one question. What's a bachelor party?
Why the long face, sugarcube?
I'm just thinking about Shining Armor. Ever since I moved to Ponyville, we've been seeing each other less and less. And now that he's starting a new family with this "Princess Mi Amore Ca-whatshername", we'll probably never see each other.
Come on, now. You're his sister. He'll always make time for you.
Couldn't seem to make time to tell me he was getting married.
We're here, we're here!
Whoa, what's with all the guards?
I'm sure they're just taking the necessary precautions. Royal weddings do bring out the strangest ponies.
Aaaaaaaaa– 
Now, let's get going! We've got work to do!
And you've got a big brother to go congratulate.
Yeah. Congratulate. And then give him a piece of my mind.
I've got something to say to you, mister.
Twily! Ah, I've missed, you, kid. How was the train ride? I–
How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married! I'm your sister, for pony's sake!
It's not my fault! Princess Celestia has requested a major increase in security. Didn't you see all the guards at the train station?
Yeah, there's a big wedding coming up. Maybe you heard about it?
It has nothing to do with the wedding. A threat has been made against Canterlot. We don't know who's responsible for it, but Princess Celestia asked that I help provide additional protection. This, you need to see.
 The burden of keeping Canterlot safe and secure rests squarely on my shoulders. Staying focused on the task at hand has been my top priority.
Okay, okay, I get it. You've got a really important job protecting all of Canterlot with a force field only you can conjure up. But still... how could you not tell me about something as big as your wedding? Am I not that important to you any more?
Hey. You're my little sister. Of course you're important to me. But I'd understand if you didn't want to be my best mare now.
You want me to be your best mare?
Well... yeah.
I'd be honored! But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know! When did you even meet this "Princess Mi Amore Cadenza"?
Twily, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance, your old foalsitter.
Cadance? As in the Cadance? As in the greatest foalsitter in all the history of foalsitters?!
 You tell me. She was your foalsitter.
Ohmygoshohmygosh! Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever! She's beautiful, she's caring, she's kind...
I am so lucky to have you as my foalsitter!
I'm the one who's lucky, Twilight.
 You're a princess. I'm just a regular old unicorn.
You are anything but a regular old unicorn.
Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake! 
I am going for a hooficure and that is that!
You are not going–
I am! I am!
I've already paid for three this month!
I... no! My girlfriends are all getting their hooves done! And you said that onl–
Please, we've done this at least–
Oh! Ho, ho, ho.
Oh, sweetie. You just did that face.
How many unicorns can just spread love wherever they go? I only know of one! And you're marrying her!  You're marrying Cadance! You're marrying Cadance!
I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.
Cadance! Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake!
What are you doing?
Cadance, it's me, Twilight!
 Uh-huh.
I've gotta get back to my station, but Cadance will be checking in with all of you to see how things are going. I think I speak for both of us when I say we couldn't be more excited to have you here. Right, dear?
Absolutely.
Well, we'll let you get to it.
Cake, check. Ice sculpture, check. Best darn bite-size apple fritter you ever tasted...
Mmm. Check.
Hiya, Princess!
Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza.
Hiya, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. You come to check out what's on the menu for your big day?
I have!
Aw, shucks. Why don't you take a few to go?  I know how you brides can be. So busy, you forget to get a little somethin' in your belly.
Did... you see what she...
Oh, you should have seen how she acted back there. I don't know when she changed, but she changed!  "Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza."
Did I hear someone say my name?
Your highness! Let me just start by saying what an honor it is to play a role in such a momentous occasion. 
 Uh-huh. Is my dress ready?
 Yes, of course. Um, I've been working on it ever since I was given the assignment, and I think you'll be pleased with the results! Mmm!
I was hoping for something with more beading and a longer train.
Oh, yes, of course.
And those should be a different color.
I think they're lovely.
Me too!
I love them.
Make them a different color.
Gee, maybe her name should be "Princess Demandy-pants."
Okay, let me see. We've been over the games...  ...the dances...
 I think this reception is gonna be perfect! Don't you?
Perfect! ...If we were celebrating a six-year-old's birthday party.
 Thank you!
Rest, my sister. As always, I will guard the night.
Bet I can guess what you're all thinking. Cadance is the absolute worst bride-to-be ever.
 Who, me?
Spike! That goes on the cake.
Twilight, whatever are you talking about? Cadance is an absolute gem!
Rarity, she was so demanding!
Well, of course she is! Why shouldn't she expect the very best on her wedding day?
Applejack, did you know that after she told you how much she just 'love-love-loved' your hors d'eouvres, she threw them in the trash?
Aw, she was probably just trying to spare my feelin's.
No, she was just being fake and totally insincere!
She did raise her voice at one of my birds during rehearsal.
See? Rude!
But he was singing really off-key.
Pinkie Pie, you had to have noticed how Cadance treated–
Never mind. Rainbow Dash, you're with me, right?
Sorry, Twi. Been too busy prepping for my sonic rainboom to pay much attention to the bride's bad attitude.
The princess is about to get married. I'm sure any negative behavior she might be displaying is simply the result of nerves.
And I'm sure it's the result of being an awful pony who doesn't deserve to even know Shining Armor, let alone marry him!
Think maybe you're bein' just a tiny bit possessive of your brother?
Uh-huh.
I am not being possessive, and I am not taking it out on Cadance! You're all just too caught up in your wedding planning to notice that maybe there shouldn't even  be a wedding!
Twily! Your big brother's looking pretty good, don't you think? Huh. Everything okay?
We need to talk. I think you're making a big–
Oh, uh, hi, sweetie.
She sure has a way of sneaking up on people.
Could I speak to you for a moment, dear?
Better see what she wants.
 Look, we need to talk.
 I'm here to talk.
 It's about your sister, okay?
 I– look, look, she's okay–
 Just... listen to me, (over Shining Armor) alright? No no–
 I'm listening, I'm listening.
 I thought I made it perfectly clear I didn't want you to wear that.
This was my favorite uncle's.
And?
And I think I should wear it.
Are you disagreeing with me?
I guess I am– Ah!
Oh, dear. Are you getting another one of your headaches?
Gyah!
Feeling better?
 Mm-hmm.
She isn't just unpleasant and rude. She's downright evil!
Twilight!
Let her go.
Huh. It seemed like she had something else she wanted to tell me.
Who goes there? Stay indoors, Twilight Sparkle.
Shining Armor's in real trouble! You have to help–
Dresses? What are you–?
Can you believe it? We're gonna be Princess Mi Amore Cadenza's new bridesmaids!
New bridesmaids? What happened to her old bridesmaids?
She didn't say. But she did tell us that she would love-love-love it if we'd fill in for them.
Seeing as we've been working so hard and everything.
And you had your doubts about her.
Told you she was an absolute gem!
You sure this is what I should wear? Doesn't seem all that aerodynamic.
Hmm. I'll see what I can do.
Looks like I really am on my own.
Perfect, girls. No need to rush. Then of course, Cadance will enter.
I'll say a few words, and then we'll begin with the vows. Shining Armor, you'll get the ring from your best mare.
 I do!
Hey... has anypony seen Twilight?
I'm here! I'm not gonna stand next to her! And neither should you!
I'm sorry, I... I don't know why she's acting like this.
Maybe we should just ignore her.
You have to listen to me!
Oh, goodness! Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Ya sure about that?
I've got something to say! She's evil!
She's been horrible to my friends, she's obviously done something to her bridesmaids, and if that wasn't enough, I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all !
 Why are you doing this to me?!
Because you're evil!
Evil! And if I don't stop you, you're gonna ruin my brother's life!
You want to know why my eyes went all ? Nuh! Because ever since I started having to perform my protection spell, I've been getting terrible migraines. Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to heal me!
And she decided to replace her bridesmaids because she found out the only reason they wanted to be in the wedding was so that they could meet Canterlot royalty! And if she hasn't been on her best behavior with your  friends, it's because with me being so busy, she's had to make all the decisions about the wedding!
I was just trying to–
She's been completely stressed out because it's really important to her that our big day be perfect! Something that obviously wasn't important to you!  Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go and comfort my bride. And you can forget about being my best mare. In fact, if I were you, I wouldn't show up to the wedding at all.
C'mon, y'all. Let's go check on the princess.
I was–
You have a lot to think about.
Maybe I was being overprotective. I could've gained a sister. But instead... I just lost a brother.
I'm sorry!
You will be.
"Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and..."  My brother?
Twily! Ah, I've missed you, kid.
How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married!
A threat has been made against Canterlot. Princess Celestia asked that I help provide additional protection.
But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know.
Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance.
Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever!
I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.
Cadance, it's me! Twilight!
 Uh-huh.
And I think I should wear it.
Are you disagreeing with me?
She's evil! I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all !
Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to heal me! If I were you, I wouldn't show up to the wedding at all.
I just lost a brother. I'm sorry!
You will be.
 Hello? Is anyone there?
Where am I?
The caves beneath Canterlot, once home to greedy unicorns who wanted to claim the gems that could be found inside. And now, your prison.
Help! Help!
Plans? What plans?
The plans I have for your brother, of course.
Don't you dare do anything to my brother, you... you monster!
Only way to stop me is to catch me! 
No! Wait! Ugh! Please! Don't hurt me! Twilight, it's me! Please, you have to believe me. I've been imprisoned like you. The Cadance who brought you down here was an imposter.
Likely story!
Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake. Clap your hooves...
...and do a little shake.
You remember me!
Of course I do. How could I forget the filly I love to sit for the most?
We have to get out of here. We have to stop her!
Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to witness the union of  Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and Shining Armor.
Oh, we're never going to save him.
We will. We just have to find... There!
You're not going anywhere.
Princess Cadance and Shining Armor, it is my great pleasure to pronounce you–
Stop!
Ugh! Why does she have to be so possessive of her brother?  Why does she have to ruin my special day?
Because it's not your special day! It's mine!
What? But how did you escape my bridesmaids?
I want it!
Hmph. Clever. But you're still too late.
I-I don't understand. How can there be two of 'em?
She's a changeling. She takes the form of somepony you love and gains power by feeding off your love for them.
 Right you are, Princess. And as queen of the changelings, it is up to me to find food for my subjects. Equestria has more love than any place I've ever encountered. My fellow changelings will be able to devour so much of it that we will gain more power than we have ever dreamed of!
They'll never get the chance! Shining Armor's protection spell will keep them from ever even reaching us!
 Oh, I doubt that. Isn't that right, dear?
Mm-hmm.
Ah, ah, ah. Don't want to go back to the caves, now do you? Ever since I took your place, I've been feeding off Shining Armor's love for you. Every moment he grows weaker and so does his spell. Even now, my minions are chipping away at it.
 He may not be my husband, but he is under my total control now.
And I'm sorry to say, unable to perform his duties as captain of the Royal Guard.
Not my Shining Armor!
Soon, my changeling army will break through. First, we take Canterlot. And then, all of Equestria!
No. You won't. You may have made it impossible for Shining Armor to perform his spell, but now that you have so foolishly revealed your true self, I can protect my subjects from you!
Princess Celestia!
Ah! Shining Armor's love for you is even stronger than I thought! Consuming it has made me even more powerful than Celestia!
The Elements of Harmony. You must get to them and use their power to defeat the queen.
Rarity!
 You can run, but you can't hide!
Go, go!
Looks like we're gonna have to do this the hard way. How did you...?
They're changelings, remember?
]: They're changelings, remember?
Don't let them distract you. We have to get to the Elements of Harmony. They're our only hope.
]: 
OK, this is just gettin' weird. Real me! Real me!
 Do me! Do me! Meh, I've seen better.
You won't get away with this! Twilight and her friends will–
You were saying? You do realize the reception's been cancelled, don't you? Go! Feed!
Sorry, Twi. We should've listened to you.
It's not your fault. She fooled everypony.
Hmm, I did, didn't I?
Quick! Go to him while you still have the chance!
Wha– where... huh? Is...is the wedding over?
It's all over!
Your spell! Perform your spell!
 What good would that do? My changelings already roam free.
No! My power is useless now. I don't have the strength to repel them.
My love will give you strength.
 What a lovely but absolutely ridiculous sentiment.
Noooooo!
Don't worry about me. I'm fine. You have a real wedding to put together.
Seriously, though. I get why the queen of the changelings wanted to be with you, but how did you get someone as amazing as Cadance to marry you?
I told her she wouldn't just be gaining a husband. She'd be getting a pretty great sister, too.
Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of the real Princess Mi Amore Cadenza–
Princess Cadance is fine.
Hm. The union of Princess Cadance and Shining Armor. The strength of their commitment is clear. The power of their love, undeniable. May we have the rings please? I now pronounce you mare and colt!
This is your victory as much as theirs. You persisted in the face of doubt, and your actions led to your being able to bring the real Princess Cadance back to us. Learning to trust your instincts is a valuable lesson to learn.
Rainbow Dash, that's your cue.
Best... wedding... ever!
Hello, everypony. Did I miss anything?
 Let's get this party started!
Twilight! None of this would've been possible without you, little sis. Love ya, Twily.
Love you too, B.B.B.F.F.
Ready to go?
Oh! Almost forgot.
IT'S MINE! Oof! Ahaha... ha.
Now this was a great wedding.
Oh, yeah? Just wait until you see what I have planned for the bachelor party! 
Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could.
I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again and stop Discord.
The Elements! They're gone!
 Everypony has to play, or the game is over and I win.
Our friendship...over?
Who are you talking to?
Nopony! Nopony whatsoever.
What?
Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you!
Why? Need a good laugh?
What is happening to my friends?
Looks like we might be due for a big old storm of chaos. 
And what are you laughing at!?
Oh, you ponies are just the most fun I've had in aeons.
Well, quit it! You'd better think before you laugh at the Pink...ie Pie!
Oh, yeah? Well ha, ha.
Quit it!
No. Ha, ha.
Quit it!
No. Ha ha-ha ha ha.
Uh... Rarity? This here diamond of yours? Twilight said we should split it six ways since we, uh, found it together.
HI-YAH! Try it, punk. He's mine. All mine! Ya! Ya! Ya!
Girls, why are you all acting like this?
Quit it! Stop it!
We need to stick together.
Ha, ha.
 It's just too entertaining.
Stop it, Discord. You're not playing fair.
I'm not playing fair? Perhaps we haven't met. I'm Discord, spirit of chaos and disharmony. Hello?
How are we supposed to find the Elements of Harmony when you took away the labyrinth before we could get to the end?
Oh, wait, did you...?  How funny! You thought the Elements were in the labyrinth?
Twists and turns are my master plan. Then find the Elements back where you began.
I never said they were in the labyrinth.
But...but...
Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle.  Maybe the magic of friendship can help you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some chaos to wreak.
Chocolate milk? I hate chocolate milk!
 Think, Twilight, think! "Find the Elements back where you began." Back where you began.
Don't touch my gem!
I'm touching your gem, Rarity. Ha, ha.
What 'chu laughin' at?
Ugh. I just want to go home... Wait a minute... Home! "Back where you began!" The Elements must be in... Ponyville! Come on, girls. I'm certain this is what Discord's riddle really meant. If we get back to the library, I have a book that I just know can give us a clue. Ah!
Good boy, Angel. Mama's so proud.
Wow, I can see so much better now. Whoa! I meant to do that.
Wah! Ahh! Whoa! Discord's turned our dirt roads into soap!
Beautiful, isn't it? This is the new and improved Ponyville, and these are only my first of changes.
This may look like fun, but it's not.
Ugh.
Picture it. The chaos capital of the world.
I can't picture anything. It's too dark. 
Well, wait a few minutes and you'll see it in the beautiful light of day. Or not.
Ponyville, the chaos capital of the world? Not if I have anything to say about it.
Don't worry, you won't. 
 Okay, we're here. Everyone please, please, please just go inside, please?
I absolutely refuse.
With pleasure.
I hate libraries!
Pleeeease, we gotta hurry!
Forget it, Twilight. I know what you're up to. The second I go in, you'll have your little minion Spike come and take Tom!
Tom?
Well, it's not going to work.
You're not going in without him, are you?
Mm-mm.
 Fine!
Ah! Brrr! What did you do that for, Fluttershy?
'Cause you just looked so peaceful.
I...uh...huh?
Careful, Twilight! You'll ruin his beautiful finish.
Oh, for the love of...
Twilight, what's going on? Why does everybody look so...gray?
Don't ask. I need you to help me find something.
Hey, Twilight, what's soaking wet and clueless?
Fluttershy, I've had just about enough– 
Your face! 
What's happened to everypony?
I guess you just bring out the worst in us, Spike.
Ugh. No time to explain. We've got to find the reference guide to the Elements of Harmony before somepony does something she'll regret!
The Elements of Harmony? Oh, I know exactly where that book is. Found it!
Hah!
Fluttershy, you'd better give me that book!
 Keep away!
Hey! Applejack, give me that book!
I don't have any book.
Pinkie! You guys! Stop it right now!
Ugh!
Mine!
Hey, do you even know what you just stole?
No, but if you want it, I want it!
 GIVE ME THAT BOOK!
Where is she? Where's Rarity?
Beats me.
Lies!
Get back! All of you! This is my book, and I'm going to READ IT!  The Elements!
The Elements! They were here all along!
This is great! Now you guys can defeat Discord and put everything back to normal!
See, girls? We did it! We found the Elements of Harmony! Together!
You don't even care, do you?
No!
 I never thought it would happen. My friends... have turned into complete JERKS! Necklace! Necklace! Necklace! Necklace! And... big crown thingy! Come on, everypony, let's go!
But Twilight, aren't you missing somepony?
Nope. We've got the liar, the grump, the hoarder, and the brute. That just about covers it.
But what about Rainbow Dash?
Congratulations, Spike, you're the new Rainbow Dash. Now let's go!
 That won't end well.
Too bad, you're Rainbow Dash. Now let's go defeat Discord so we don't ever have to talk to each other again!
Yeah! Woo-hoo!
Move! Look out, here comes Tom!
Well, well, well, I see you've found the Elements of Harmony. How terrifying!
Discord! I've figured out your lame riddle. You're in for it now!
I certainly am. You've clearly out-dueled me, and now it's time to meet my fate. I'm prepared to be defeated now, ladies. Fire when ready.
Formation, now!
Eh.
"Rainbow Dash", get over here.
All right, let's get this over with.
What's going on?
Mine's workin'. There must be somethin' wrong with yours.
I HATE the Elements of Harmony!
Hmph! Garbage.
MINE!
Sorry, Twilight. I guess I'd better get back upstairs and clean up the library. Good luck with all this– whoa!
Bravo, ponies, bravo! 
It's your fault it didn't work.
Who are you talking to?
Any of you! ALL OF YOU! I'm outta here!
I better go, too. I've got new better friends waiting for me at the farm.
Yeah! I'm sick of you losers.
FINE! Leave! See if I care! I don't need you guys either! With friends like you, who needs...enemies...?
 Oh, my stomach! Twilight, you've got to see what I just did.
It's priceless!  Come now, Twilight Sparkle. You've got to get into the spirit of things! After all, this is your new home.
Not anymore...
YES! 
Pack your things, Spike, we're leaving.
Don't ask where we're going, 'cause I don't know yet. Just not here.
Can't...move. The princess...has been sending these...since I came back upstairs.  Make it stop!
These are all the letters I've written to the princess since I've lived in Ponyville. But why would she send them back?
"Real friends don't care what your cover is."
Spike! Spike, it's all so clear! Can't you see? Discord's trying to distract us from what's important. He knows how powerful our friendships are, and he's trying to keep us from seeing it. Do you remember what I said the first day we arrived in Ponyville? I told you that the future of Equestria didn't rest on me making friends. But the opposite is true! The friendships I've made since I've been here are what saved Equestria from Nightmare Moon. And now they need to save it from Discord!
You're right, Spike. I've got to fight for my friendships. For them. For me. For Equestria!
Oh...uh...why don't you just stay here and rest? I'll take care of the whole fighting for friendship thing myself.
And so I tried to defeat Discord, but none of my so-called "friends" would lift a hoof to help me.
Applejack, I'm here to fight for our friendship.
Oh, now you want to fight. Where you went when I was battlin' Discord?
Snap out of it. This isn't you! You're not a liar.
Wh-what happened? Twilight!  I saw a vision of us feudin' and fightin'. I couldn't face the truth, so I started tellin' lies. Can you ever forgive me?
I already have. Come on!
Oh no! Twilight, Applejack, I just had the worst dream!
 What do you think you're doing? Get away from my gem! Get away--!
 Let us never speak of this again.
 Can you believe it?!
Uh? She's not here.
Without Rainbow Dash, we can't use the Elements.
She could be anywhere by now! We're never gonna find her.
Yeah, we will, 'cause she's right there!
Rainbow Dash!
Hey, guys!
We've been looking everywhere for you!
That's nice.
Discord's still on the loose! We need you to help us defeat him with your element, Loyalty!
Pfft. Loyalty, schmoyalty! Have you guys seen Ponyville? It's a disaster! I'm staying here in Cloudsdale where everything's awesome.
How in Equestria can she think that tiny patch of clouds is Cloudsdale?
The same way he got you to think that cheap rock was a bona fide diamond.
I thought we agreed never to speak of that again.
Time for Plan B.
 Okay, Fluttershy, you grab Rainbow Dash and hold her down. Applejack will lower me down from this rope so I can cast the memory spell on her.
Got it!
Um...I'm just wondering if it's okay if I hold you down against your will for a little bit?
Ugh...
Nice try! Ponyville's your problem, not mine.
Come on, Fluttershy, we've got to catch her. Hyah! Applejack!
WHOA!
PINKIE! You were supposed to secure the ROPE!
Oops.
Rarity, Pinkie, hold on! Y'all are slowing her down!
Oh, Fluttershy, would you be a dear and FLY FASTER, please?
 I can't!
If you can't catch her, Discord wins!
That big... dumb... MEANIE!
Okay, Applejack, last rope! Make it count!
Lemme go! I don't need you guys! Leave me alone!
Wh-what happened?  How's Ponyville? Where are the Elements?! Did we stop Discord?
Maybe it's a little early for a group hug.
 Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing.
Not as wonderful as friendship.
Oh, this again?
That's right. You couldn't break apart our friendship for long.
Oh, Applejack, don't lie to me. I'm the one who made you a liar. Will you ever learn? 
I'll tell you what we've learned, Discord: we've learned that friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt it's worth fighting for!
Ugh, gag. Fine, go ahead, try and use your little Elements. Friend me. Just make it quick. I'm missing some excellent chaos here.
All right, ladies, let's show him what friendship can do!
Wait-wait-wait! 
Huh. What's this? No. NO!!!
We are gathered here today to once again honor the heroism of these six friends who stood up to the villain Discord and saved Equestria from eternal chaos.
Quill.
Check.
Parchment.
Check.
Extra ink.
Check.
Extra extra ink.
Check.
Is that everything on the checklist?
Yep.
Great. Now that we've completed the checklist of things we need to create a checklist, we can make my checklist of the things I have to get done by the end of the day. Ready?
Ready!
Item 1: Create checklist of the things I have to accomplish by the end of the day.
How are we doing, Spike?
Let's see... We've already dropped off your cape at the cleaners, returned the blackboard you borrowed from Cheerilee, ordered new parchment and quills from the stationery shop...
Hmm... Seems like we just placed an order for those a few days ago.
Can't imagine why we go through so many of them.
Sounds like we're ahead of schedule. What's next?
Cupcakes!
Whoa...
Uh, I only ordered twelve.
Oh, I know, dear, but I had an extra. So I thought I'd make it a baker's dozen.
Uhhh-no!
Oh, that was very thoughtful of you. It's just some of the icing from the extra cupcake is getting all over the one next to it. See?
Ohh... sure...
It's just that I'm planning on sharing these at a picnic later and I don't want anypony to feel like somepony else is getting more icing.
Oh, no... of course not.
Not to worry, I'll just move some of this one to... hmm... I think I may have scooped too much... oops! Now those two have more. Let's just try this again... Hmm, no, that won't do. Let me just... hmm... put some here, and... no, that's not right. A little more on this one, a little bit... and wait... I'll just... ooh, a little bit here, and here, and... perfect!
Hmm, oh yes... much better...
Okay, time to tackle the next item on our-- oops! Looks like we're going to have to add 'give a baby dragon a bath' to our list.
Very efficient! And a little bit gross.
Eh.
Looks like that's everything!
Almost everything.
"Triple-check checklist to make sure we didn't miss anything when we double checked the checklist!" Uh... check! Ugh... I've been holding that quill so long, I've got a claw cramp! Well, good thing we don't have anything to report to Princess Celestia this week... I don't think I could write another word!
We haven't sent a letter to Princess Celestia this week?!
Why? Is that bad?
Bad? BAD? Of course it's bad! I'm supposed to send Princess Celestia a letter every week, telling her about a lesson I've learned about friendship! Not every other week, not every ten days, every... single... week!
Huh?
Ohh... Where's my calendar, where's my calendar?!
Where it.. always is?
When did we send the last one?
Last... Tuesday?
And today is...
Tuesday?
Argh! Nononononononono! If I don't send her a letter by sundown, I'll be... tardy!
What's that now?
Tar-dy, Spike! Late, I'll be late! Oh, how could I let this happen? I'm usually so organized. I've never been late with an assignment.
Oh, please! You're the most studious student ever! I'm sure the Princess will forgive you if you miss one little deadline.
I'm afraid to take that chance, Spike. This is the ruler of all of Equestria we're talking about. The pony who holds my fate in her hooves! What if she doesn't forgive me?
Yeah... I don't think she--
What if instead she starts thinking I'm not taking my studies on friendship seriously?
Why would she--
What if she makes me come back to Canterlot and puts me back in school and makes me prove I've been taking them seriously by giving me a test?! What if I don't pass?!
Well, why wouldn't you pass--
She's my teacher. Do you know what teachers do to students who don't pass? They send them back a grade! But she won't just send me back a grade. She'll send me back to... magic kindergarten.
Twilight? Twilight!
Huh?
That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! You're not going to be sent back to magic kindergarten.
You're right. I have no reason to worry. Because I'm going to solve a friend's problem and get that letter to Princess Celestia before sundown!
So... got any problems, troubles, conundrums, or any other sort of issues, major or minor, that I as a good friend could help you solve?
Huh. Hmm. Huunh. Huh... I got nothin'.
 Then it looks like I'm going to have to find somepony who does.
 This won't end well.
You've got this, Twilight. You still have plenty of time to get that letter to Princess Celestia! Has to be somepony who needs the help of a good friend!
Rarity!
Don't worry, Rarity! I'm here!
 WHYYYY?! Why? Why-y?! And of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING!
What's happened? Are you alright?
 I've lost my diamond-encrusted purple ribbon! I have searched high, and I have searched low. Low and high! High and low! But I can't find it anywhere! Anywhe-e-e-e-ere! How can I possibly finish my latest creation if I can't find it?!
Never fear, Rarity. As your friend I'll do my best to help you fi--
Oh, there it is. Isn't it always just the last place you look?
So... you just lost your ribbon?
Mm-hm!
But now you've found it?
Yuh-huh.
And nothing else is bothering you? Nothing that I, as a good friend could help you with?
Hmm... there is one thing.
Yes?
I think I left my measuring tape under the fabric over there. Could you get that for me?
 Measuring tape? Sure.
Twilight? Is there something bother-- Twilight?
No need to panic. Rarity is just one pony. I'm sure one of my other friends will need me.
What in the world...? Rainbow must be angry with Applejack! She must hate her guts! How wonderful! Rainbow Dash! Stop! Listen, Rainbow. I know you're upset with Applejack, but don't worry. Whatever it is that has come between you two, I'm sure that I, as a good friend, can help you resolve your problems.
Uh, what are you talking about?
Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to hide your feelings from me! I can tell you two must've had a terrible fight.
Now, why don't you tell me all about your issues with Applejack.
I don't have any issues with Applejack.
You don't? Then why are you destroying her property?
Because she asked me to. Right, Applejack?
Yes, ma'am. I wanted to put up a new barn, but this one's gotta come down first. Hehe. Now get back to it, R.D.
You got it, boss!
I'd take cover if I were you.
 I can't believe I wasted all that time. I should have just come here first. Fluttershy always has some fear she's trying to get over. As a good friend, I'll be able to help her.
Fluttershy?
How can this be happening? Of all the days she had to stop being such a scaredy-pony, she had to pick today?! What am I going to do?!
You really should have come to me sooner. You were carrying so much tension in that shoulder.
It's fine. It'll all be fine. The day isn't over yet. But it will be over soon!
 It'll be all over! My time in Ponyville! My advanced studies! Nono. You're a good student. You can do this. Ooh! But what if I can't? You can! You just have to keep it together. Keep. It. Together!
Are you talking to... yourself? Twilight?
Snap out of it!
Huh?
Are you okay?
Twilight, I'm really worried. I mean this letter thing is really getting to you. Here. You've been so anxious all day that you completely forgot about the picnic. Why don't you just relax and go hang out with--
The picnic! I should go see my friends!
I'm glad you've come to your senses.
Please tell me I did not forget the plates.  Why, why, why... Uh... What? You didn't expect me to lay on the grass, did you?
You alright, hun?
No! I am not alright.
It's just terrible.
Yes?
Simply awful.
Yes!?
It's the most horrific trouble I've ever been in and I really really really need your help!
YES!?
My letter to Princess Celestia is almost overdue, and I haven't learned anything about friendship!
Oh, thank goodness. I thought something really awful had happened.
 Something awful has happened! If I don't turn in the letter on time, I'll be tardy! TARDY!
No offense, sugarcube, but it looks like somepony's gettin' themselves all worked up over nothin'.
This is not nothing. This is everything. I need you guys to help me find somepony with a problem I can fix before sundown! My whole life depends on it!
Come on now. Have a seat and stop sweatin' the small stuff.
Wow. I've never seen Twilight so upset before.
Oh, what a drama queen. Mm. Relatively speaking...
Clock is ticking, Twilight. Clock. Is. Ticking. Keep it together. If I can't find a friendship problem... I'll make a friendship problem!
Hi, girls! 
Oh, hi, Twilight. How's it go--
Gr-eat. Just great. You three look like you're doing great too! Looks like three good friends who obviously don't need the help of another good friend. This is Smarty Pants. She was mine when I was your age, and now I want to give her to you!
Uhh... she's... great.
Yeah. Great.
I really... like her... mane.
She even comes with her own notebook and quill, for when you want to pretend she's doing her homework!
That's... um... great.
Yeah... great.
I really like her... mane?
I just hope the fact that there are three of you and only one of her doesn't become a problem! I'd hate to cause a rift between such good friends. So, who wants to play with her first?
Uh... You should play with her first, Sweetie Belle. Y'know, 'cause you like her mane so much.
Nonononononono. I think Scootaloo should get to play with her first.
I'd love to, but, um, you take her, Apple Bloom.
Applejack says it's important to share.
 Ooh, you're going to like Smarty Pants. And you're going to like her more than anything.
 I want it.
I need it.
I really like her mane!
The 'want it, need it' spell. Works every time. Okay, okay, let's break it up. I think we can all see that there is an important lesson to be learned here about-- Ugh! C'mon, girls, we're all friends here, right? Don't you think you ought to share?
No way!
 Big McIntosh! Thank goodness! You've gotta help me get that doll away from those girls!
Eeyup.
Oh, thank you so much. Now if you could just give her to me?
Nnnope.
Oh no!
Give her back!
What's all the commotion about?
They're fighting over that doll!
That incredible, amazing doll!
Can't... get... a clear shot! 
Gimme!
Nope.
Oh, what have I done?!
Y'all hear that? What in the name of all things oats 'n apples is goin' on here?!
Don't look at it!
Don't look at what?
My Smarty Pants doll! I enchanted her and now everypony is fighting over her!
Why would you enchant your doll?
Oh, I had to do something! I had nothing to report to Princess Celestia! I thought if I couldn't find a problem, I'd make a problem! The day is almost over!
Not almost!
Twilight Sparkle!
Whoa nelly.
Meet me in the library.
Goodbye, girls. If you care to visit, I'll be in magic kindergarten, back in Canterlot.
Magic kindergarten?
Canterlot?
We're never gonna see Twilight again!
Uh, what are we gonna do, y'all?
Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING! What? I really mean it this time!
But...but... I'm supposed to send you a letter about friendship every week. I missed the deadline. I'm a bad student! I'm... tardy!
You are a wonderful student, Twilight. I don't have to get a letter every week to know that.
Really?
Wait!
You can't punish her!
It wasn't her fault!
I'm listening.
Please, your Highness. We all saw that Twilight was upset.
But we thought that the thing she was worrying about wasn't worth worrying about.
So when she ran off all worked up, not a single one of us tried to stop her.
As Twilight's good friends, we should have taken her feelings seriously and been there for her!
Please don't take her away from us just because we were too insensitive to help her.
Looks like you all learned a pretty valuable lesson today.
Mm-hmm.
Very well. I'll forget Twilight's "punishment" on one condition.
From this day forth, I would like you all to report to me your findings on the magic of friendship when, and only when, you happen to discover them.
Princess Celestia, wait! How did you know I was in trouble?
Your friend Spike made me aware that you were letting your fears get the best of you. I commend him for taking your feelings seriously. Now, if you will all excuse me, I must return to Canterlot. I'm expecting some mail.
Y'all heard the Princess. Spike, take a letter.
 Dear Princess Celestia,
We learned that you should take your friends' worries seriously.
Even if you don't think that she has anything to worry about.
And that you shouldn't let your worries turn a small problem...
...into an enormously huge entire-town-in-total-chaos Princess-has-to-come-and-save-the-day problem.
Signed, your loyal subjects.
P.S. Obviously Spike did not have to learn a lesson, because he is the best, most awesome friend a pony could ask for. Unlike everypony else, he took things seriously, and- Eheh... uh... yeah... I'll just, um...
Ugh, come on, Twilight. We're gonna be late for the Nightmare Night festival. Huh? Are you that one kooky grandpa from Ponyville Retirement Village?
I'm Star Swirl the Bearded! Father of the amniomorphic spell? Did you even read that book I gave you about obscure unicorn history?
Uh.. 
Nightmare Night! What a fright! Give us something sweet to bite!
Hi, everypony. Great costumes. Happy Nightmare Night, Granny Smith.
I should have been asleep five hours ago.
Pipsqueak the pirate, at your service. It's my very first Nightmare Night.
Since you moved here from Trottingham?
No, my very first Nightmare Night ever!
 Enough chitchat! Time is candy!
Pinkie Pie, aren't you a little old for this?
Too old for free candy?  Never.
 Do you like it?
Yeah! Great costume, Twilight! You make a fantastic weirdo clown!
A clown? Look at the borders on these robes. These are hoof-stitched!
It's a great costume! Huh! Grandpa!
Star Swirl the Bearded is only the most important conjurer of the pre-classical era.
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
He created more than two hundred spells! He even has a shelf in the Canterlot library of magic named after him. Maybe I should start up a pony group to teach ponies about history. I bet everypony would love it! Don't you, Spike?
 I love it!
Hey look, we're here already! Should we get something to eat?
Twilight, Twilight! Look at our haul! Ah! Can you believe it? And then, we went to Cheerilee's house, and got a bunch more goodies. Didn't we, Pip?
Sure did!
And then, we had to stop and wait for Granny Smith, and -–
Rainbow Dash, that wasn't very nice.
Lighten up, old-timer. This is the best night of the year for pranks!
Look what you did to Spike!
It's all in good fun. Oh! Oh! There's another group over there!
Happy Nightmare Night, Applejack!
Howdy, Spike! Hey, Twilight! Nice costume.
Thanks! I'm a dragon.
She means me, Spike.
With that beard, I reckon you're some sorta country music singer.
While y'all are here, ya' feel like bobbin' for an apple?
Thank you, everypony, and welcome to the Nightmare Night festival!
Now, all the little ponies who have been out collecting sweets should follow our friend Zecora to hear the legend of... Nightmare Moon! 
Spooky voice might work better if she wasn't dressed like that.
Follow me, and very soon, you'll hear the tale of Nightmare Moon.
Listen close, my little dears, I'll tell you where you got your fears of Nightmare Night, so dark and scary.  Of Nightmare Moon, who makes you wary.
Every year, we put on a disguise, to save ourselves from her searching eyes.
But Nightmare Moon wants just one thing: to gobble up ponies in one quick swing!
Hungrily, she soars the sky. If she sees nopony, she passes by. So if she comes and all is clear, Equestria is safe another year!
Uh, Miss Zecora, if we wear costumes to hide from Nightmare Moon, so she won't gobble us up, how come we still need to give her some of our candy?
A perfect question, my little friend. For Nightmare Moon you must not offend.  Fill up her belly with a treat or two, so she won't return to come eat you!
 Everypony! Just dump some candy and get out of here!
 It's Nightmare Moon! Run!
 Princess Luna!
 Citizens of Ponyville! We have graced your tiny village with our presence, so that you might behold the real Princess of the Night! A creature of nightmares no longer, but instead a pony who desires your love and admiration! Together we shall change this dreadful celebration into a bright and glorious feast!
Did you hear that, everypony? Nightmare Moon says she's gonna feast on us all!
 Madame Mayor, thy Princess of the Night hath arrived.
What is the matter with you? Very well, then. Be that way. We won't even bother with the traditional royal farewell.
I'm gonna go talk to her.
You can't talk to her! She's Nightmare Moon!
No, she's not. I saw the Elements of Harmony change her back to good. But it seems like she's having some trouble adjusting after being gone for a thousand years.
Princess Luna? Hi, my name is -–
Star Swirl the Bearded. Commendable costume! Thou even got the bells right.
Thank you! Finally! Somepony who gets my costume! Uh, I just came to welcome you to our celebration! My actual name is -–
Twilight Sparkle.  It was thou who unleashed the powers of harmony upon us and took away our dark powers!
And that was a good thing, right?
 But of course. We could not be happier. Is that not clear?
Well, you kinda sound like you're yelling at me.
But this is the traditional royal Canterlot voice! It is tradition to speak using the royal "we", and to use  this much volume when addressing our subjects!
You know, that might explain why your appearance was met with... mixed results. I think if you just changed your approach a bit, you might be met with a warmer reception.
 Change our approach?
Lower the volume?
 Ohhh. We have been locked away for a thousand years. We are... not sure we can.
Don't worry, Princess. Fluttershy can give you some great pointers. She's delicate and demure with the sweetest little voice.
Go away! No candy here! Visitors not welcome on Nightmare Night!
 Fluttershy, it's me, Twilight!
It is you. Ah, and Nightmare Moon. 
 Wait right here.
Fluttershy... you remember Princess Luna?
 Charmed.
 Likewise.
 Twilight Sparkle hath spoken of the sweetness of thy voice. We ask thou teachest to us to speak as thou speakest.
 Okay.
 Shall our lessons begin?
 Okay.
 Shall we mimic thy voice?
 Okay.
 How is this?
 Perfect, lesson over!
A little quieter, princess.
 this?
Better. Right, Fluttershy?
 Yes.
 How... about... now?
Now you're getting it.
 And... how about now?
Yes! Well done.
 I thank thee, dear Fluttershy! Our normal speaking voice shall surely win us the hearts of thy fellow villagers.
Fluttershy! You've gotta hide us! Nightmare Moon is here and...  Ah! She stole Fluttershy's voice so she can't scream when she gobbles her up!
 I mean... nay, children, no, wait.
Come on, princess. Time for plan B.
Hurray!
Aah!
It is of no use, Twilight Sparkle. They have never liked us and they never shall.
My friend Applejack is one of the most likable ponies around. I'm sure she'll have some ideas.
Heee...!
Whoop. Careful there, partner. 
Uh... Applejack, the princess is looking for a little advice on how to fit in around here.
"Fit in"? Really?
I mean... that's easy! All you gotta do is have the right attitude. Loosen up a bit, be positive, play a few games, have some fun.
Fun? What is this "fun" thou speakest of? Pray tell, what purpose do these serve?
Try to land the sp-sp-spiders on the web.
You can do it, princess!
Ha! Your princess enjoys this "fun"! In what other ways may we experience it?
Fire away, princess!
Ha ha! The fun has been doubled!
Hurray! 
Why don't you try bobbin' for apples? We got the best apples in Equestria here, princess.
I ask that thou call us... me... Luna, fair Applejack. Hear me, villagers! All of you! Call me Luna!
Luna... 
Show me to these bobbing apples.
Whoa! 
Hey, gals. Anypony seen Pip? We lost him the last time we had to run–  Aaah! Nightmare Moon is gobbling Pipsqueak! Everypony run!
Help! My backside has been gobbled!
'Tis a lie! Thy backside is whole and ungobbled, thou ungrateful whelp!  Fair villagers, please do not back away. Let us join together in... fun!
Not enough fun for you? What say you to this!?
Huzzah! How many points do I receive?
Do not run away!
As your princess, we command you!
 Be still!
Princess, remember! Watch the screaming!
 No, Twilight Sparkle! We must use the traditional royal Canterlot voice for what we are about to say. Since you choose to fear your princess rather than love her, and dishonor her with this insulting celebration, we decree that Nightmare Night shall be canceled! Forever!
 Shoot. We had everything goin' our way. Luna was happy, everypony in town was happy, now look at 'em.
 But I wanted to be a zombie next year.
It's not over yet.
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to do what I do best. Lecture her!
Princess?
Leave me be, Twilight Sparkle.
Princess, I'm sorry it hasn't worked out how we wanted. But you have to believe me when I tell you that Nightmare Night is one of the most popular celebrations we have.
Yes. I can tell. By all the adoring shrieks of the children as they run away.
Princess...
No! No shrieking. No screaming or squealing either. Okay?
 Okay.
There's something I want you to see. And I promise that it's safe, but you really, really, really can't shriek. Do you promise not to shriek?
Mm-hmm. 
Pinkie Pie, you remember Princess Luna, right?
Ah. The ringleader of the frightened children. Hast thou come to make peace?
Nightmare Moon! 
Rainbow!
She's changed, Pinkie! She's not evil or scary anymore! And she definitely doesn't want to gobble you up!
Well, duh.
Huh?
I know that. Sheesh, Twilight. I'm almost as big as her, how's she gonna gobble me up?
So why do you keep running away and screaming?
Sometimes it's just really fun to be scared!
Fun? Pinkie Pie, you're a genius!
No, I'm not. I'm a chicken. 
Princess Luna! I've finally figured out why you're having so much trouble being liked!
 Forgive me if I withhold my enthusiasm.
Come with me. I'll explain everything on the way.
Gosh. I never thought my very first Nightmare Night would be my very last.
Come, little Pip. Now don't you fret. Nightmare Night's not over yet. We still have candy left to give, so Nightmare Moon might let us live.
Yes. Come on, little ponies. What's Nightmare Night without the annual candy offering? You don't want Nightmare Moon to gobble you up, do you?
Aw, the rainbow wig just kills it for me.
Come on, kids! Doesn't that sound like fun?
Goodbye, Nightmare Night. Forever.
 Citizens of Ponyville! You were wise to bring this candy to me. I am pleased with your offering. So pleased that I may just eat it... instead of eating you!
 I am not certain that did what you meant for it to do, Twilight Sparkle.
Just wait.
For what? For... for them to scream some more?
Um... Princess Luna. I know there's not gonna be any more Nightmare Night, but do you suppose maybe you could come back next year and scare us again anyway?
Child. Art thou saying that thou... likest me to scare you?
It's really fun! Scary, but fun!
It... is?
Yeah! Nightmare Night is my favorite night of the year.
Well then. We shall have to bring  Nightmare Night back!
Whoa! You're my favorite princess ever!  She said yes, guys!
YAY!
See? They really do like you, princess.
Can it be true?  I mean... Oh, most wonderful of nights.
Dear Princess Celestia,
Rarity! Rrgh, you ruined the surprise! I was gonna serve you breakfast in bed!
Well! G'mornin', Rarity!
Father! Mother!
I'll have you know that Sweetie Belle here cooked this yummy lookin' breakfast all on her own.
I... figured.  I didn't know you could burn juice.
I've been giving her lessons. I wouldn't be surprised if she's got a cutie mark in fancy cooking by the time we get back from our vacation.
Vacation? Is that this week? As in 'starting this very instant' this week?! Uurh. Let me guess: apple sauce?
Nope. Toast! We're gonna have the bestest time two sisters could ever have! I'm gonna go grab my stuff from Dad's wagon.
So, now, when you say 'a week'... is that, um, seven whole days?
And six nights, I know! Such a short time to spend with your little sis.
You gonna eat that?
But I've got such a long to-do list. Oh well, I suppose 'spend time with your sister' will just have to be added to the list.
Just a few necessities.
Now, let's get that kitchen all cleaned up.
Cleaned up? But we haven't even eaten yet.
Well now, Sweetie Belle, I appreciate the gesture, but we simply can't eat this breakfast; it's burnt.
It's not that burnt.
Never fear, my dear, I'll get a proper breakfast going.
Can I help?
Oh, er, of course, er, in one moment, Sweetie Belle. Let me just get things started.
Rarity! I thought you said I was gonna help!
You are! You... can... put the garnish on the plates.
You mean this parsley?
Okay, now, easy! It has to be just right! No need to rush. No! That's too slow. Careful! Back up! Looking for perfection here...
Whoa, whoa!
Not... bad.
 There are some things I must attend to. Can you take the dirty towels to the laundry room?
No problem, I'll make myself useful!
Sweetie Belle!
I told you I'd make myself useful. Surprised?
Am I? You washed my incredibly expensive one-of-a-kind designer crocheted wool sweater! Do you know how hard these things are to come by?
What's the big deal?
The big deal is that in the heat of the sun, wool... shrinks.
Oh. Sorry.
Nng... Well. Back to work. I must create.
Sorry?
Huh. Stay out of trouble, okay? Please?
I just wanted to do something nice for my sister.
Raargh, I'm so bored! When is Rarity gonna finish her work?
 Stay out of trouble, okay?
I never got in trouble for drawing. Hmm. This needs something...
Hi, Rarity! I made a special drawing for y–
 Oh no! Did you use these gems?!
Well, yes, but I know you'll have more in your work room...
But, but these are extremely rare baby blue sapphires! I need them for an outfit for an extremely important client!
Oh. Sorry.
 Sweetie Belle, what am I going to do with you?
Oh! We could paint together, we could ride bikes, play chess, sing a song, catch frogs, pillow fight–
That's not what I meant!
Oh.
Now I have to go and find some more of these gems!
I'll go with you and help!
No! No thank you. You can help by picking up these papers and stacking them, neatly. Put the pens and pencils back exactly where you found them, and please find something to do that doesn't create a large mess for me to clean up!
Geez Louise, can't I do anything right?
Sweetie Belle! I'm back! Sweetie Belle? 
Surprise!
My- ee- bleh- My inspiration room! What did you do? What did you do?!
When I saw the big mess in your room, I thought I'd clean it up for you.
This wasn't a mess! It was organized chaos! I was just about finished planning my new fashion line, and, and you, you, you went and, and you– and you put everything away!
But every time I make a mess, you get upset!
But this was my mess in my house! And now I have to start from scratch!
But, I thought it would make you happy!
Happy?! Happy?! I–  I just need some time alone. Hm!
How's the sleepover at Rarity's goin'?
 Why, it's smashing!
Huh?
I just wish we could do something special together that didn't include me goofing anything up.
The Sisterhooves Social! Applejack an' I do it every year! You an' Rarity can compete against other sister teams in all these neat events!
That sounds like the perfect way for us to hang out! Rarity will think it's an excellent idea.
What a ridiculous idea. A contest at Sweet Apple Acres? It doesn't sound... very... clean.
So, what, now you're back to hating messes?
Sweetie Belle, watch your tone! I am still your big sister.
Right! And any sister who cares about her sister goes!
Sweetie Belle...! Honestly! Playing silly little games in the dirt is just... uncouth! With or without a sister.
Well then! Maybe, maybe I'll try the Sisterhooves Social without a sister! In fact, I think I'll try the rest of my life without a sister!
 Oh, I'm the one who's ruining your life?! Really?! Have you looked around this place? I'm the one who'd be better off with no sister!
Well it looks like we finally agree on something! Neither of us needs a sister!
Deal!
Deal! Goodbye, un-sister!
Hmph!
'Uncouth'? She said the Sisterhooves Social was 'uncouth'?
Yeah! Uncouth?  Wait. What's uncouth?
It's not just the Social. She thinks I'm uncouth.
Honey, Rarity thinks everything's uncouth.
 What's uncouth?
It means uncivil. Y'know, bad mannered?
Exactly. Sweetie Belle, just give Rarity some time. She'll come around. Sisters always do.
Not sisters like Rarity.
Come on, now. Apple Bloom and I got some chores to finish up on. Maybe you can help!
You sure you want me to help? I just mess everything up!
Oh, come on, that's just stinkin' thinkin'. Watch!
Good catch there, Apple Bloom! Whoo!
This is a chore?
Since we can't sell the bruised apples, we gotta collect them all for the pigs to eat.
It's a lot of work, so we make a game of it. Wanna try?
Um, okay. Ow! You're right, it is hard work.
That's why we do it...
Together!
Huh, Rarity never wants to do chores together.
Ugh, all that work ruined, thanks to Sweetie Belle. Oh my. It's usually a big mess in here.  Well, no matter. She still shouldn't have touched my things without permission. Hm!
Apple Bloom! You're up!
You're... making... grape juice? Rarity would call the fashion police on me if I got grape juice anywhere near her precious outfits.
Well, that's silly!
Apple Bloom...
Please, Applejack, she didn't mean–
Whoa! 
How d'you like them grapes, y'little whippersnapper!
That tickles! 
Now to get these fabrics washed for my fabulous new line. Ooh, my favorite sweater... I just can't believe that Sweetie Belle.
Oh, Opal-wopal! It's as if Sweetie Belle knew the sweater was perfect for you. And Sweetie Belle should consider herself perfectly lucky that this thoughtless mishap turned out all right. Hm.
Apple Bloom!
Got it, sis!
Wow. It's as if they were just one pony.
Yee-haw!
Way to corral some critters, sis!
You coulda just a-a-a-asked.
Rarity never high-hoofs me.
Perfect! Just one more, and this ensemble is fini! Rrgh, Sweetie Belle! Where's her silly little arts and crafts project?
Oh, Sweetie Belle! My one and only sister! What have I done? All the time I could have spent with you was wasted complaining and wishing you were gone!  Woe is me! No! I must get her back! I must! As Celestia is my witness, I shall never be sisterless again!
 Sweetie Belle! Oh, I have been galloping all over looking for you. I–
Oh hello, un-sister. What are you doing here? Better be careful, you might get some dust on you.
Oh, Sweetie Belle, I want to apologize. I am not better off without a sister.
I'm not better off without a sister either. Spending the day with Applejack and Apple Bloom made me realize that.
Oh, Sweetie, you don't know how happy I am to hear–
And that's why I'm adopting Applejack as my big sister!
What?!
What?!
What?!
A sister is someone who loves and takes care of another sister. Applejack's a real sister.
H-Hold on, Sweetie Belle. Don't get ahead of yourself here.
Besides, she's my big sister!
Yeah, um–
 Or maybe she should be your sister, so she could teach you what a good sister is supposed to be!
Heh, um, actually, I–
But I don't need lessons on being a good sister, I-I promise! Listen! I'll show you how to cook my favorite quiche! Or, or, I'll show you the proper way to beautify your mane. Won't that be fun? Hm?
Hm! You want me to go home with you, so we can do what you wanna do?
Uh... yes?
Just forget it!
We're still sisters, right?
Well, that apology went swimmingly. Applejack, why do you have to be so good and make me look so bad?
 Oh Rarity, once again you're thinkin' about yourself. Bein' sisters is a give and take. You've been doin' a whole lotta takin', but you haven't been doin' a whole lotta givin'.
But of course I give. I give lessons. Reasonable demands.
But ya never give in. Bein' sisters is like... apple pie. You can have amazin' apples, and you can have a wonderfully crispy crust, but only together you can have a perfect apple pie.
But apart, all we are is just a pile of mush and some crumbly dry mess...  I know what I need to do! I just hope it isn't too late!
Well, I guess it's a good thing Rarity isn't here. Do I see 'uncouth' written all over this contest?
Look at the size of that pig!
He sure is a cutie.
That's the last word Rarity would use.  Oh my, what a repulsive monstrosity! This thing needs a head to toe makeover!
It's almost time!
Well, you two have fun. Sure wish I had a sister to run the race with. Huh?
You do now!
AB and I figured since we do this every year...
I'd let you borrow my sis so you can give it a try!
Sister for a day.
No way!
One. Day. One. Day.
Is this thing on?  That's what I said.
That's us.
One. Day. Good luck!
And may the best sisters win! On your marks... get set... Gooooo!
You okay, Applejack?
Applejack, help!
You can do it, sister!
Ooh, so close! You almost won!
Thank you, Applejack! You were amazing! I don't even care that we didn't win. This was so much fun! Huh? Rarity?! Wait, where's Applejack?
I don't get it.
 We switched places over at the very first mudhole.
So, we did the whole competition... together?
That we did, little sister. Well, except for the start line.
But you finished together!
You mean... you were all in on it?
Mm-hmm.
You did this for me?
Us. I did it for us. You see? We are apple pie!
Huh?
Uh, I'll explain later. For now, I think we deserve a celebration!
Yeah!
Where?
The spa, of course.
Oh, Rarity.
No, I-I-I'm serious.
Very well then, what should we write to the Princess?
I'll start. Having a sister is just about the bestest thing in the world. But it sure isn't the easiest.
I agree that being sisters is a wonderful thing, but it takes teamwork. Sometimes it's about compromising. Sometimes it's about accepting each others' differences. But mostly, it's about having fun together. Even if it means getting your hooves a little bit dirty.
A lot dirty.
A little bit dirty.
A lot dirty.
A little bit dirty!
A lo–
Hold it, hold it! How about "a medium amount of dirty, not too little, not too much, just right"?
Deal!
Today's the day, Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can just feel it! Today's the day we are all gonna get our cutie marks in... bowlin'!
Whoo-hoo!
 I mean, yaay!
Why, after today, we won't even be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore! We'll be the... the Three Strikes!
That makes us sound like we've struck out.
Mmm. How 'bout the Pin Twins?
But there are three of us.
Okay then... Um... the Bowlin' Dolls!
The Bowling Dolls! That's it!
Perfect!
All righty then! Let's bowl 'em over!
Phpoo!
Cool! A bowling cutie mark!
I did it! I did it! Blank?
But... but... what about my ball?
That bowling sure was fun, even if all I got was gutter balls.
Yeah, at least you were able to keep your ball in your lane. I don't think Mr. Kingpin is ever gonna let me play again! Hey, maybe I could get my cutie mark in demolition!
Aw, come on, Apple Bloom.
I know just what you need to put the bloom back on your apple.
A treat from Sugarcube Corner will cheer you up.
No, it won't.
A party will cheer you up!
No, it won't.
A lovely new chapeau will cheer you up.
No, it won't.
Come on, Apple Bloom, it's just a cutie mark!
Or lack of a cutie mark!
Shh! That's not helping! Apple Bloom! Where are you going?! Apple Bloom, come back!
Whoa! Ah! Ooh! Ow! Nnnn...
Well, who is it that we have here? Why, it's Apple Bloom, my dear!
Ow...
What has happened to you, youth? Ah, you've gone and chipped your tooth. Come with me, I have just the trick that will fix you up quite quick.
 I've tried everything, Zecora, and still no cutie mark! Well, I'm gonna be as old as Granny Smith and still have a blank flank!
Your frustration is well understood, but one must be patient for all things good.
 Ugh, I've heard that from every pony I know! And now from every zebra I know! I'm just too impatient to be patient. I just want my cutie mark and I want it now!
For your cutie mark, you will have to wait. We must fix that tooth before it's too late. Now drink down every little drop, and this mixture will mend that chip on top!
 Oh my star apples, you did it, Zecora! Golly, you have tonics that heal all sorts of ailments. Bad bones, bad back, bad breath...
Yes little one, it is true, I have many a healing brew.
And not only stuff that fixes the bad, but stuff that brings the good! Good health, good hair... good heavens! Hmm... I bet you can mix up a brew to fix... anything.
There are many mixtures in this room, but none for what you want, dear Apple Bloom. A magic potion does not hold the key. For a cutie mark, time is the only remedy.
Fine. Whatcha got goin' on there?
I am brewing up another mix for a rooster and his chicks.  making mornings very slow.
Hey, I've seen that flower bloomin' in Ponyville! What is it?
It is one we call 'Heart's Desire'. A dash will ignite the rooster's fire. With Heart's Desire, his talent comes into view, and he'll give a mighty cock-a-doodle-doo!
Zowie! Heart's Desire, huh?
Ay me, but what is this? I have run out of amethyst. I must go get this purple flower for my brew to have full power!
Yeah, you go, you go.
I'm so hungry.
Yeah, I can't wai--
Aah! Apple Bloom! You got your cutie mark!
Um, Apple Bloom... what is it?
Yeah! Is it an 'o'? Is your talent spelling?
Or is it a ring? Are you a jewelry maker?
Or is it a powdered donut? 'Cause that sounds delicious.
No, it's a loop-de-hoop!
 A what now?
A loop-de-hoop! 'Least, that's what I always called it. Applejack made it for me from an old rain barrel when I was littler! Who woulda thought that loop-de-hoop would end up bein' my special talent?
Wow, Apple Bloom, that's amazing!
That's it? That's your talent?
Spinning a hoop around your waist? Puh-lease.
Oh, you ain't seen nothin' yet.
Apple Bloom, you're super-duper-loop-de-hooper!
Thanks, everypony!
All right, my little ponies, time for class!
Apple Bloom?
Yes, Miss Cheerilee?
I want you to take your loop-de-hoop into the yard... and give us all a lesson in your amazing loop-de-hooping!
Don't worry, gals. Keep at it and you might get to be half as good as me!
Grr...
Great job, girls!
You're too kind, Apple Bloom.
Yeah, we stink.
Nah, you just need a little practice. Soon you'll be able to... hoop and bop! Hoop and hop!  And hoop and flip!
 Show us some more, Apple Bloom.
Well, all right, just a few more tricks. But be warned! These are advanced moves, not for beginners. Got that, Diamond Tiara?
I call this one the hoop-la!  Huh? Oof!
Another cutie mark? Hah! I guess that last trick was a lot of hoopla. Those cutie marks are fake!
What? No they're not!
Miss Cheerilee, have you ever heard of a pony with two cutie marks?
I must say that I never have, but maybe Apple Bloom has two special talents!
Oh yeah? Then let's see you do that!
Spin plates!
Yeah!
Two cutie marks?
Two talents?
Aw yeah!
Our friend is the most...
...special pony ever!
Alright, everypony, You ready for a real show?
Yee-haw, little sis! Congratulations on gettin' not just one, but two cutie marks! We're mighty proud of you, right, Big McIntosh?
Eeyup.
I've never seen anythin' like it. Have you, Big Mac?
Nnnope.
Why, the way you were a-hoopin' and a-hoppin' and kickin' and spinnin' reminded me of when I was a spry young filly. Guh, charley horse, charley horse! Ooh, that's better.
Why, Apple Bloom, I think you're ready to hit the rodeo circuit right now!
Actually, I'm ready to hit the hay right now. I'm plum tuckered. I'll see y'all in the mornin'. Night!
Night! Oh my, little Apple Bloom has finally blossomed, hasn't she, Big Mac?
Eeyup!
 Three cutie marks?!
Help me!
Help me!
C'mere, you! Ow! Ow! Whoa!
I'm sorry, Applejack! I dunno how to make it stop!
Well, I know somepony who might!
Three cutie marks. Three talents. I've never seen anything like it! I was just reading something about unusual equine illnesses. What was it?
"Perplexing Pony Plagues", perhaps?
Yes, Spike, you're amazing!
Yes, well, I do have some talents.
Hay fever... the trots...  Cutie pox!
Cutie pox?!
Cutie pox. This puzzling pony plague afflicted a population of ponies back in the Paleopony Period!
Heh, say that ten times fast!
Random cutie marks appeared all over the ponies' bodies, causing them to perform all the talents that came with them!
Just like me!
Yes, but what's the cure? What's the cure?!
It says here there's no known cure!
No known cure?!
The cause of the breakout was never discovered, and the cutie pox disappears as mysteriously as they arrived!
Oh no! Sacrebleu! Plus de marques de cutie!  What's this?! I speak French?!)
My sister's speakin' in fancy!
She needs help!
I know she needs help! We can't just wait for this to go away! We gotta find somepony to mix up a cure! And fast!
Tout de suite! (Now!)
Not some pony... some zebra!
Zecora!
Hurry, hurry!
Dépêchez-vous! (Hurry!)
She's cursed!
Hexed!
Enchanted!
No, she's not.
She just has some weird mysterious disease with no known cure called cutie pox.
Cutie pox?! 
She's got the cutie pox!
I thought I had removed their fear the last time that I visited here. But doors are barred and shutters shut. Guess I should've stayed inside my hut.
Zecora! Apple Bloom has cutie pox! We were just on our way to see if you had a cure!
But magically you're here! Was your zebra sense a-tinglin'?
My 'zebra sense' did not bring me round, it was a special flower that I needed found. I thought I picked enough to fix all the potions I had to mix, but after my visit from Apple Bloom, some had mysteriously left my room. Apple Bloom! What do you say? Did this flower just walk away?
I, um...
A cutie pox cure I have forsooth, for healing power is in the Seeds of Truth.
Well, well then give 'em to her! Quick!
These seeds must be planted in the ground. With the truth, they'll grow, and the cure is found.
Come again?
The Seeds of Truth do hold the cure, but one must speak words, true and pure.
Well then let's get to it! Alright, they're planted, now somepony tell the truth!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Somepony! Anypony!
Yesterday I told Mrs. Cake that I ate two corn cakes, but I really ate three! Okay, six! I ate six corn cakes!  Make it stop! Oh, make it stop!
Wah, I can't stand it any more! It's me! I admit it! I didn't earn my cutie mark! They're all fake! I figured the Heart's Desire would help me get what I wanted most! So when Zecora left her hut, I mixed up a special potion and put the rest of the Heart's Desire in it!
 Ahh.
Apple Bloom!
Are you okay?
I'm great, and I've never been happier to be a blank flank. But I'm awful sorry I lied, 'specially to you gals. I was so desperate for my cutie mark, I just got carried away. And I'm really sorry I snuck those flowers from you, Zecora. Why, I wouldn't blame you if you never wanted me to come by again.
Now, Apple Bloom, do not be silly. You are always welcome, my little filly. With each mistake you learn something new, growing up into a better you.
Apple Bloom, would you mind writing to Princess Celestia and telling her what you've learned?
I'd be happy to, Twilight! Spike?
Ready!
Dear Princess Celestia,
I sure am proud of you, sis. Seems like you finally learned the importance of patience.
Yup! All good things come to those who wait. Well! I've waited long enough.
Actually, that was way too long.
What?!
So what are we gonna do today to earn our cutie marks?
Well, I was thinking, for a pony who's never mixed up a potion before, you sure stirred up something fierce.
Yeah! So what if your talent is potion making?
Oh my gosh, totally! Let's go talk to Zecora, now!
Yeah!
Woo-hoo!
Ha-ha! Whoo-hoo! Yeah!  Whoa!
Who? Oh, it's you, Owlowiscious. C'mon, try and keep up! 
Winona? I mean... Winona's head?! Um, is this weird, or is it just me? Angel? Gummy?! Okay, this is officially beyond weird now and right on down to freaky town.
 Yaaaaah!
Whaa!
Phew.
Let's get this thing started!
Sincerest apologies, Rainbow, if our pets were bothering you.
Say you're sorry, Opal.
She's... sorry.
What are you all doing out here?
Why, we always round up our critters for a regular ol' Pony Pet Playdate in this park.
Uh, you do?
Same time every week.
I thought you knew. You didn't know? She didn't know?
Well, we had initially planned on inviting Rainbow, of course, except–
We were totally gonna invite you, Rainbow, then Twilight remembered that you don't even have a pet, and Rarity remembered that you really like to take naps in the afternoon, so Applejack figured you wouldn't be missing out on anything anyway, and Fluttershy and I nodded our heads in agreement like this.
Oh, please don't be mad at us.
Oh, I'm not mad. You all are right. Not much point of a Pony Pet Playdate for me if I'm a pony without a pet, right?
Eeexactly. So, if'n you'll excuse us...
Hey, now wait a minute! Just because I don't have a pet now doesn't mean I never want a pet!
Ohh! Y, y, Oh, really? You really want a pet? Really? 'Cause I've got so many wonderful choices at my house! Oh, and I know you'll just love them! And they'll love you! Oh, and you'll be best friends forever and ever! Oh!
 So! You all think you've got what it takes to be my pet, do ya? Well, we'll just see about that! If any of you don't think you can handle it, bow out now before you humiliate yourself in front of your peers. This competition isn't for the weak. You'd better be prepared to step up your game! You call that flapping?! That's better. There's only room on Team Dash for one of you, and my future pet needs to be able to take it to the extreme! Any questions?
I got one. Does she understand what a pet really needs?
Yeah, like care and attention, love and affection– Ugh! And breath mints!
Now, you just pay attention, and try your best, and–
Seriously, Fluttershy! The turtle? What did you bring that thing here for?
Technically he's a tortoise, and he's always dreamed of being somepony's pet. He just wants a chance to compete, he won't get in the way. You won't even know he's here.
No.
Oh, just let him try.
Ugh, but there's no way he can possibly keep up. Look at him!
It won't hurt to let him try.
But–
Just let him try?
Grrgh, ugh, fine! But don't say I didn't warn you! This isn't a game, you know! Alright, now these games will determine which one of you has the most important qualities I'm looking for in a pet. Speed. Agility. Guts. Style. Coolness. Awesomeness. And radicalness.
Aren't those all the same thing?
You would think that, Twilight. And that's why you would never qualify to be my pet.
Speed! On your marks...
Get set...  Sorta speedy... not speedy... pretty speedy... could be more speedy...
Yeah! That's speed!
 Tsk-tsk. That's just sad.
Agility! Sorta agile... not agile... pretty agile... could be more agile...  Wanna know the opposite of agility? That.
Yeah, baby, now that's what I call agility!  Don't leave me hangin'! I'm gonna have to shave a point off your score for that.
Okay! Which of you has the guts to try and get Opal's favorite toy away from her?
Now that takes guts!
Style! Any pet of mine's gotta look good, 'cause you gotta make me look good!
Coolness!
Sorta cool.
Not cool.
Pretty cool.
Could be cooler.
Not what I had in mind. I can't hear you!
Eugh.
Now that's a cool sound!
 Uh, you did that already. That's pretty much all you can do, huh?
Whoa! That was truly awesome! But I'm afraid this is the radicalness competition, so I'm gonna have to take some points off.
 Listen, turtle...
Tortoise.
Whatever! You've had your fun, but I think you and I both know who made the cut and who didn't.
You didn't.
I mean... 'A' for effort and everything, you gave it your best shot, maybe I've got a gold star sticker around here somewhere you can have, but, seriously, go home. You're starting to creep me out. So, anyway, you're all outstanding competitors, but there can only be one of you who's number one. So the final tie-breaking contest is going to be... pause for dramatic effect... a race against... me! Through Ghastly Gorge! Dun dun dun!
Gesundheit.
Actually, Ghastly Gorge isn't scary. It's fun. Heh. I've flown through it a million times myself, so obviously I'll be at the front of the pack. But whichever of you make it across the finish line with me will have proven you can keep up with me, and will have earned the honor and glory of getting to be my pet! Ready? Setgo!
Woo-hoo! Haha! Try to keep up!
Can't catch me, ha-ha!
C'mon, slowpokes! You wanna win, don't ya?
Oh! I forgot to tell you! Watch out for the Quarray eels! They don't like it when you get too close to their nests, like this. Whoa.
Easy, peasy, one-two-threesy! Right, guys?
AVALANCHE! Hey! Whoaaaa!
C'mon... No! Wait! Come back! Don't leave me! I'm the one who's supposed to win! I don't wanna end up stuck here... forever! Oh no, nonono, th-this can't be happening. Forever is way too long to be trapped in Ghastly Gorge. I mean, it's like, forever! Somepony! Anypony! Help me!
Wahoo! My prayers have been answered! Oh, thankyouthankyoutha– You?! Oh no! Now I'm not only going to be stuck here forever, I'm gonna be stuck here forever with the most annoying turtle in the world! Gyh, I'm doomed. DOOMED, I tell you!
Hm, something's not right here.
Where's Rainbow Dash?
Great galloping galoshes! There's been an avalanche in there!
Rainbow!
Wait! Look!
It's the turtle!
Tortoise!
Oh, whatever...
And he's carrying something on his back...
Ahh! It's Rainbow Dash! It's her! It's Rainbow!
Maybe we'd better go meet him halfway.
Huh. Way to go, little guy!
Oh, thank goodness you're not hurt, Rainbow!
Just my pride.
I certainly hope all of this dreadful dust was worth it! 
It sure was, if'n it means Rainbow gets to have her own little critter just like the rest of us from now on.
Uh... thanks. What you did... I owe you one.
Rainbow! Your new pet is over here waiting for you!
Oh... Right... Yeah... That.
What's the matter?
You got your perfect pet, right?
The best of the best like you wanted, remember? It can fly and it's not a squirrel! Should we sing about it again?
A falcon sure looks good on ya, Rainbow.
Easy, fella. Nothing to be afraid of. The falcon sure does looks cool... He's absolutely everything I wanted in a pet. 
Yay?
But I said whoever crosses the finish line with me gets to be my pet.
You did! You did say that! She did say that, that was the rule!
And the only racer who crossed the finish line with me was the one who stopped to save me when I needed help. The tortoise!
But what about the–
Wouldja look at that? He even smiles slow.
Spike, take a letter. Dear Princess Celestia,
Today I learned what the most important quality really is. A certain kind of spirit. A stick-to-it-ive-ness. A never give up, can-do attitude that's the mark of a real winner. And this tortoise has it.
Tenacity.
Gesundheit. You just can't stop that little guy. He's like a... like a... Tank!
But Rainbow! You didn't want a pet that couldn't fly because it would keep you grounded and hold you back, remember?
Hmm...
Heh. C'mon, Tank! We're gonna be late for our very first Pony Pet Playdate!
Attention, everypony! Attention! The official Rainbow Dash Fan Club will come to order. Let's get right down to our first order of business. I motion that Rainbow Dash be declared the most awesome pony in Ponyville.
I second the motion, and might I add that if you looked up the word 'awesome' in the dictionary, there would be a picture of Rainbow Dash.
I object!
I think the word 'awesome' is played out! Rainbow Dash deserves better! I motion that we declare her the most stupendous pony!
'Stupendous'? Is that the best you've got? I motion that we declare her... wonderiffic!
Astonishing!
Breathtaking!
Astounding!
Bedazzling!
What about super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing?
All in favor of declaring Rainbow Dash the most 'super-ultra-extra-uh-whatever you said' pony in all of Ponyville, say 'aye'!
Aye! 
 What a beautiful day. There's nothing like a dip in the clouds to make a Pegasus feel super relaxed.
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Looks like my sky swim will have to wait! I'm Rainbow Dash, and I'm here to rescue you!
Wow. What's with this crowd? Uh, thanks, everypony. It was really no big deal.
To me it was! You're my hero, Rainbow Dash!
That Rainbow Dash sure is something.
Something special.
 Oh no! There's something wrong with the baby!
She's not cheering for everypony's favorite hero, Rainbow Dash!
There just aren't enough words in the dictionary to describe Rainbow Dash's awesomeness.
I can think of a few new words.
And I bet 'modest' is not one of them.
No, but she is kinda awesome.
Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow Dash is here!
We'd be lost without you!
You're our hero, Rainbow Dash!
Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!
I can't hear you!
Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!
Call me silly, but I think this whole hero thing might be going to Rainbow Dash's head.
You may be right...silly.
And then I zoomed into the well. I knew it would be dark and dangerous, but I didn't let that stop me. Danger's my middle name. Rainbow 'Danger' Dash. Thinking back on it, I acted pretty awesomely heroic that day.
That day.
Awesomely heroic that day and awesomely arrogant ever since.
Mm-hm.
Hey, Applejack. How'd you like to be immortalized as my friend?
Immorta-what?
Are you taking notes?
Yup! I've been hoof-picked by Rainbow Dash herself, to write her autobiography!
Umm, autobiographies are supposed to be written by the pony they are about.
Maybe for your normal, run-of-the-mill ponies. But I'm far too busy saving lives to stop and write. That's why I hired Spike as my ghost writer.
 Spike's a ghost!
...Anyway. Spike here writes down everything I say. Don't you, Spike?
Don't... you... Spike. Got it!
This way, I can stay focused on performing those acts of bravery that nopony else has the guts to perform. Yep, it takes guts. But it also takes brains. And sometimes a big lunch and a nap. Being a hero is surely not for everypony, but I'm up to the challenge.
 There you go.
Someday, I wanna be just like you!
Aim high, kid, but don't aim for the impossible.
Help! Help!
Uh, don't you think you should go and help?
 Yeah, yeah. I've got a good ten seconds to spare. Just a couple more.
The tension is unbearable. Will Rainbow Dash make it on time?
Holy turnips, that pony came outta nowhere!
I've never seen such bravery in all my life!
That's right! Ponyville has a new hero. A mysterious mare that has done well by our fair city today. I dub this new masked hero 'The Mysterious Mare Do Well'!
Mare Do Well, huh? Well that mare would do well to stay outta my way! Ponyville's only got room for one hero, and that hero is me!
 Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow–
Excuse me, uh, do you think you could skip your catchphrase and just hurry up and save us?!
Ugh, fine! Picky, picky. Whoaaaa! Aah!
Oh, thank you, Mare Do We– e...
I can't believe it. Mare Do Well is stronger than me? Well, a hero is more than just muscle, and she's gonna learn that the hard way.
Huh?
Huh? Never fear, your friendly neighbor– Whoa!
Never fear– Uh! I'm coming! Hold on! Whoa!
Look!
Look out for the– Watch out for falling– On your left! Agh! Your other left!
Here ya go, safe and sound.
Well, Mare Do Well, or should I call you Mare Do Slow? You're gonna have to pick up the pace if you wanna compete with me, 'cause I move like lightning.
Actually, she saved all of us! We owe her our lives!
 Okay. She's strong, fast, and somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time. I've gotta step up my game.
 If the dam breaks, the whole town will be flooded! Looks like Ponyville needs a hero! Easy peasy.
My game is officially back on. If only somepony were here to pat me on the back. Eh, guess I'll have do it myself–  Help! You?! I suppose you want me to thank– You gotta be kidding me...
Lemme get this straight. She's strong, she's agile, and she's magic? Ughhh! How do I compete with that? Wait a minute. I do have a leg up on her. And that leg is... wings! Hah! Take that, Mare Do Well!
Oh, for the love of Pete.
Gotta hand it to the girl, that Mare Do Well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats.
I must say, I was impressed by that spell she used to fix the dam. Seems like something like that would take quite a bit of study.
She really cares about everypony's safety.
Have you seen her costume? It is to die for! If you ask me she's a hero of fashion.
And she's modest and humble. She lets her actions speak for themselves. Gotta admire that.
I don't have to admire that! I don't think she's all that great!
She's... great.
I didn't say that.
Sounds like somepony's jealous.
Who, me?
Rainbow Dash is jealous.
Don't write that, Spike!
Correction: Rainbow Dash is very jealous.
Fine! Laugh all you want, but I'll be the one laughing when I prove to you all that I'm just as good– no, that I'm a better hero than Mare Do Well!
Huh, no sign of trouble here. Darn it.
Buses and baby carriages are always careening down this hill. Where is an out-of-control vehicle when you need one?!
Rrgh, there are absolutely no freak natural disasters going on anywhere! How am I supposed to prove myself when everything's so normal and safe?  Hold it right there, Granny Smith! You don't have to pretend with me. I can see that you're in way over your head here.
Eh, what's that?
You're putting on a brave face, I get it. But you don't have to anymore. I'll help you cross the street!
 Actually, I can cross the street just fine!
Don't worry! You're in extremely... capable... hooves!
 Back off!
 Here we are! Safe and sound. A good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition, don't you think?
I didn't wanna cross the street in the first place! 
 Somepony's in trouble!
You'd better let me handle this, ma'am! For your own safety, I must ask you to stand back!
Oh, brother.
Ta-da!
Uh... thanks.
How would you describe what I just did? Would you say I was amazing?
Aren't you milking this a bit?
Please, just answer the question! Was I, or was I not, amazing?
Oh, you're amazing alright. An amazingly–
Oh, look!
Another great feat of heroism! I have just saved that grass!
From what?
From weeds! Weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn!
Lame...
Whatever.
Aww, who am I kidding?
All anypony talks about is Mare Do Well this and Mare Do Well that! What about me? How could everypony forget about me so easily? I mean... have I changed? Same sleek body. Same flowing mane. Same spectacular hooves. Nope, I'm still awesome. They're wrong. But... then... why am I all alone? I hate being all alone.
Hey, Rainbow Dash!
I knew it! No need to apologize, squirt. Anypony could make that mistake.
Mistake? What mistake?
Wait a minute. Why are you here?
To invite you to join us! We're heading off to the thank you parade for Ponyville's greatest hero, Mare Do Well.
No! No way! Can't you see I-I wanna be alone? I love being alone.
Oh, okay. See you later then.
Yeah, right, like I'm gonna thank her.  Hey, squirt! Wait up!
Welcome to Ponyville's first, but surely not last, thank you parade, in honor of our city's greatest hero, the mysterious Mare Do Well!
The mysterious Mare Do Well, huh?
So what are you hiding? Let's see how mysterious you are without that mask!
What the hay?
Grrr... I got you now! Alright, Miss Mysterious! Mystery... solved!  P-p-p-p- Pinkie?! Whudda- hud-d-duh- hud-d-duh- huh?! Twilight?! Applejack?! There were three of you?!
Yup, we all played Mare Do Well at different times.
I stopped the carriage bus with these babies, Bucky McGillicuddy and Kicks McGee.
I saved the construction workers with my Pinkie Sense. 
Sorry!
It's alright.
And I used my magic to fix the dam.
Ooh, ooh! And I did the flyby afterwards.
I made the costumes. Fabulous if I do say so myself!
I don't understand. Why? Don't you want me to be a hero?
Of course we want you to be a hero.
But a real hero doesn't brag.
Uh, I guess I did start to brag a little.
A little?!
Okay, a lot.
Celebrating your accomplishments is natural. But...
...Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not.
Yeah, the only thing that should be rubbed in anypony's face is chocolate cake. 
I think we're getting off topic here.
What we're trying to say is, it's great to be really good at something, but it's important to act with grace and humility.
Ohhhh. That makes loads more sense. Yeah. You're right. And I guess I should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me. Like Mare Do Well.
Sounds like you've got a letter to write to Princess Celestia.
Already got it covered. As your ghost writer, I've already penned a letter to the Princess.
That's nice of you, Spike, but I really wanna write this letter myself.
Aww, come on, I wrote the whole thing already!
Okay, let's hear it.
 Dear Princess Cel-
Look out! It's a real ghost!
 Here? I get to stay here?
Twilight Sparkle said you were coming to Canterlot for a visit, and asked if I might accommodate you.
Thank you so much, Princess.
You're very welcome.
No, really. This is so nice of you.
It's nothing, really.
Oh, but it isn't nothing, it's everything! I, I just don't know what to say but thank you, thank you! 
You are very we–
Thank you!
 Your luggage, mademoiselle?
I'll leave you to get settled.
Your highness.
Enjoy your stay.
Thank you!
 Where would you like me to put these?
That's perfect.
Opal, do you know what I love about Canterlot?  Now, I know that we are here to pick up some fabrics for the shop, but Twilight was such a dear to get me that suite at the castle, I simply must make her something to express my gratitude. Hmm... ooh! An outfit for her birthday party this weekend! Perfect! Don't you just love it here, Opalescence?
Please excuse our interruption. I'm Jet Set, and this is my wife Upper Crust. We saw you from across the cafe and just had to find out...
...Where did you get that simply marvelous chapeau?
Oh, this old thing? Oh, it's just something I–
Rarity! Hey, Rarity! Whoo! It's me, Hayseed Turnip Truck! We met at the big hoedown in Ponyville last month?
Oh, yes, of course... how are you?
Good! Real good!
Hmm...
You're from... Ponyville?
Well, yeah, yes, but–
She sure is! She's a real big-time fancy pants dressmaker there! Probably made that real purty thing she's got on her head!
I thought it looked a little country.
I told you it wasn't something you could get here in Canterlot, dear.
Hmph!
Well, they seemed real nice.
"Looked a little country". "Not something you can get in Canterlot". I'll show you something worthy of Canterlot!
 Fancy Pants!
I say, that's one way to make an introduction.
Oh, goodness, I am so sorry. I didn't see you there. I've just got so many bags and I was trying to get back to my suite at the castle and–
You're staying at the castle?
Wh– The Princess invited me to stay in one of the suites.
You know the Princess?
Hmm, a pony with expensive tastes, I see.
Oh, it's for an ensemble I'm making for a friend. Her birthday is in a few days.  Again, I am really sorry I bumped into you.
I'm not! Heheh, you are obviously somepony worth bumping into! Listen, I have a VIP box reserved at the Wonderbolts Derby this afternoon. Would you, would you be so kind as to join me and a few of my companions there?
Me?
But of course, my dear.
Well, I'm, uh, ah- no- sure.
We'd love to see you there, uh...?
Rarity.
Rarity.
Pro: Seeing the Derby from a VIP box is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Con: Going to the Derby cuts into the amount of time I have to finish Twilight's outfit. Pro: Fancy Pants is the most important pony in Canterlot. His stamp of approval could mean big things for me here. Con: Twilight's party might not be as sophisticated as the Derby, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't put all of my energy into creating her birthday ensemble. My Ponyville friends will appreciate my hard work more than anypony. I'd hate to let them down. And I won't. Opal, I am going to the Wonderbolts Derby as a guest of Fancy Pants! 
Pardon me. 'Scuse me, 'scuse me!
Rarity, jolly good to see you! So glad you could make it.
Everypony, this is Rarity. She's staying at Canterlot Castle.
Fillies and gentlecolts, welcome to the Wonderbolts Derby! The competitors are taking their places at the starting line, and the race will begin momentarily!
I'll be rooting for Rapidfire, of course. He's sure to take home the grand prize.
I don't think he has a chance against Fleetfoot.
And it's Fleetfoot by a nose!
Bravo, Rarity! I say, how did you know Fleetfoot would be victorious?
My friend Rainbow Dash talks about her all the time. She says what Fleetfoot lacks in size, she makes up for in speed.
And who is this 'Rainbow Dash'?
Uh...  Why... she's... she's the... the Wonderbolts' trainer, of course.
Staying at Canterlot Castle, and she knows the Pegasus training the Wonderbolts. I told you all this was an important pony.
Three cheers for Rarity, my new favorite party guest!
Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray!
...And then I said, "Puh-lease, that isn't a hat, darling, that's a natural disaster that somehow landed atop your head!"
Oh, you are a delight, Rarity, an absolute delight. You simply must attend my art gallery opening this evening. 
Oh, I'd love to, but I–
And let's not forget my charity auction tomorrow morning.
Well, that sounds wonderful, but I–
And of course there's a seat for you at my dinner party tomorrow night.
I'm flattered, really. It's just I have a project I really need to get started on, and-
Oh, but Rarity! I may as well close down the whole gallery if you can't attend!
My auction is for charity, dear. For charity...
And my dinner party will be a disaster if you don't come.
...of course I'll be there.
Wonderful!
Oh, thank goodness!
Disaster averted!
Looks like we'll be spending a few more days here, Opalescence. Turns out bumping into Fancy Pants like that was the best thing that's ever happened to me. Of course, finishing Twilight's dress in time for her birthday party is still my top priority, but I can't possibly disappoint the Canterlot elite by rejecting their invitations now, can I?
Oh, I hope I haven't forgotten anything.
Me... too...
We'd better get going.
I must get back to Ponyville with enough time to finish Twilight's ensemble.
For me? Dearest Rarity, your presence is requested at the Canterlot garden party tomorrow afternoon. Yours, Jet Set and Upper Crust!  My dear Twilight, I am afraid I won't be able to make it to your birthday party tomorrow, because... because poor Opal is quite ill, and she is in no condition to make the long journey back to Ponyville! I do hope you understand. Your friend, Rarity.
I suppose this means you don't need me to bring down your bags?
No. But, I will need some help unpacking them.
Oomph!
What do you think? Too much? You're right. Too little. Ah, garden party, here I come!
Surprise!
 Swoosh! And right before she hit the ground, shoom, she– Hi again!
What are you– how did you– Why are you–
Listen to her. She's so excited to see us, she can hardly talk.
What I mean to say is, what are you all doing here?
When I got your letter saying you were stuck in Canterlot, I asked Pinkie Pie if it wouldn't be too much trouble to move my birthday party here, so you wouldn't have to miss it!
Balloons are super easy to pack.
Wow... First you get me a suite at Canterlot castle and now this. I don't know what to say, Twilight.
How about you start by saying what you're doing in that fancy getup?
This? Uh- well, I- I always put on something a little fancy when Opal's feeling under the weather... Cheers her right up. 
Oh, poor Opal. Where is the sick darling?
Oh, uhh, she's... Hold on a minute.
Huh?
I am so sorry about this.
She's resting on the bed.
Poor baby.
She looks awful.
Is... that my dress?
Yes.
It's so... simple. So practical. So me! It's the perfect dress for my birthday party! I love it!
 You don't know how glad I am to hear you say that.
When I told the Princess that I was moving the party to Canterlot, she was kind enough to offer us the Canterlot castle ballroom!
Isn't it fancy pants?
Fancy Pants?! Where?! Ahh, I mean, where did you find the time to put up all these decorations? Ha-ha. 
Oh, I never leave home without my party cannon!
Ta-da!
I thought about having my birthday outside, but they're having another party on the castle grounds today.
Let's party!
Mmh... No reason I can't at least make an appearance...
I'm here!
Darling, I'm so glad you made it.
Rarity! So happy to see you here.
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
 Is that cake frosting?
...Yes, I always dab a little frosting behind my ears before I go out.  After all, who doesn't like the smell of cake frosting?
I know I do.
Mm-hmm.
 Well, all this talk about cake has made me hungry. Think I'll go and see what's on the hors d'oeuvre table. If you'll excuse me...
I think I left the bathwater running in my suite.
I really should go check on Opal...
Is that Princess Celestia?
 I need to use the little fillies' room!
Can I get anypony more punch?
I... have to go to do the... thing with the... stuff... you know...? 
Uh, what's with the croquet mallet?
 What croquet mallet?
Duh, the one in your mouth!
 Ooh, that croquet mallet. I- well I, you know, the truth is... the truth is...
Were you at that other party in the garden?
I, I...
Rarity, I'm surprised at you.
Twilight let me explain! I–
I hadn't realized you were such a savvy businesspony!
You must understand! I–
All of those ponies look so posh. And with the Grand Galloping Gala coming up, I bet you could totally get some of them to buy your dresses. Very smart!
Woo, wwwhy yes, I-I didn't want you to think I was being rude, so that's exactly the reason I didn't tell you. The one and only reason. 
Oh, well, you didn't have to do that. You should totally go over there and mingle!
Twilight, you really are the best friend a pony could ever ask for. I don't know why I ever thought you wouldn't understand.
Understand what?
Nothing. See you girls later!
Hey, wait up! We're your friends! I'm sure they won't mind if we check out the party too! C'mon, you guys! Let's show them how to party Ponyville style!
Oh no!
Mmm!
How come y'all aren't doing any gardening? This is a garden party, isn't it?
Can you believe what that pony is wearing?
It's just so plain.
 Yeah.
Excuse me, might I ask where you got your ensemble?
Why, yes! Yes, you may. A very, very close friend of mine from Ponyville made it for me.
Ponyville? You don't say?
I do say. Her name is–
Fancy Pants! Come with me! I'd like to show you this, er, thing that's over there. On the other side of the room.
In a moment, my dear. This lovely filly from Ponyville was just about to tell me who made her charming dress.
That dress? Oh come now, who cares, it's just a plain old–
Oh, don't be so modest! This dress you made is beautiful!
We all think so!
 You know these ponies?
Yes. Yes, I do know them. They may not be as sophisticated as some of you Canterlot ponies, but they are my best friends. And they are without a doubt the most important ponies I know.
Important ponies? These ruffians?
Don't make me laugh!
I, for one, find them charmingly rustic.
And I think the dress you made for your friend is lovely.  I dare say every mare in Canterlot will be wanting one.
Oh, I'd like to place my order right now.
I think you should get two.
Er, yes, now then. How about you introduce me to your friends?
With pleasure!
Dear Princess Celestia,
Now that I would like to hear.
I learned that no matter where you go in life, you should never forget that you are the product of your home and your friends. And that is something always to be proud of, no matter what.
Hm, a very valuable lesson to have learned.
It certainly is! But... might I ask that we hurry things up a bit?! Oh no!
