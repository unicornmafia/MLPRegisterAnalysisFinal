Uhh!

12
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,350
Woebegone!

13
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,390
Come back here.
You miserable little wretch.

14
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,020
Oh, phew!

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,770
(thundering)

16
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,190
Oh, dear!

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,320
I've got you now, Woebegone.

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,820
(roars)

19
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,490
Oh, my!

20
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,710
You're all looking so
bright and colorful today.

21
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,330
(sniffs)

22
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,590
And who are you?

23
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,000
Sshhh! I'm in big trouble.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,250
An aligatorsaur is after me.

25
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,150
Can I hide here a while?

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,010
Just till he's gone.

27
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,090
You can hide in there.

28
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,350
By the way,
what's an aligatorsaur?

29
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,850
You're about to find out.

30
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,830
(stomping)

31
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,990
Ahhh!
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

32
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,610
Has a little squirt and tattered
wretch run through here?

33
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,870
Are you sure?

34
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,680
Of course I'm sure.

35
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,700
Besides,
what's a big guy like you

36
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,630
chasin' a little squirt
for anyway?

37
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,760
Yeah, you should be
ashamed of yourself.

38
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,960
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,850
If he's here, you'll find out.

40
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,020
If not, count yourselves lucky.

41
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,300
He's big trouble.

42
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,530
Aww...
(thud)

43
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,720
Are you all right?

44
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,950
I'm fine, thank you.

45
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,060
Except for a tiny pain
in my big toe.

46
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,530
Aww, you're hurt!

47
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,030
Aligatorsaurs are big.

48
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,620
But they're really light
on their feet.

49
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,480
I'll be fine...really.

50
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,240
Wait!

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,790
We can't let you go.

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,640
You will if ya know
what's good for you.

53
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,250
See that?

54
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,210
I did that.

55
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,810
I thought that
big aligatorwhatsit did it.

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,220
That's true.
But I brought him here.

57
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,340
Bad luck follows me everywhere.

58
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,840
Oh, we won't hear another word.

59
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,740
You're staying with us.

60
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,810
- No ifs...
- Ouch!

61
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,490
...ands or buts.

62
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,430
There now.

63
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,780
You just rest easy for a while.

64
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,020
Then you can be on your way.

65
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,520
You just don't understand.

66
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,030
Aw, come on, uncle Woebegone.

67
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,790
Stay and go nappy time with us,
pwetty pwease?

68
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,500
When you wake up you can
have gingerbread cookies,

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,750
and milk.

70
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,620
Those are gingerbread cookies?

71
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,870
I don't know what happened
to them.

72
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,960
But they still taste good.

73
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,510
It's starting again.

74
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,710
First your cookies crumble,
then <i>boom!</i>

75
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,210
Your whole house falls down.

76
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,890
(crumbles)
Nonsense! Now get some rest.

77
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,610
I'm warning you.

78
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,780
(all scream)
Help! Help!

79
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,470
Is everyone okay?

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,790
All safe, Posey

81
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,730
but awfully scared.

82
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,780
We have to sleep outside?

83
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,280
Of course not.

84
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,240
We'll find a place for you
in the Estate.

85
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,130
Go with Masquerade.

86
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,820
Where's Woebegone?

87
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,130
He must still be in there.

88
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,670
(loud knocking)

89
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,220
He is so still...

90
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,500
- Is he--
- Achoo!

91
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,090
You're alive!

92
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,340
Not if we don't get out of here.

93
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,240
Good idea.

94
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,730
Surely now you realize
that you've got to let me go.

95
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,080
Oh, I don't know.

96
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,520
It looks to me like the roof was
gonna collapse... eventually.

97
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,420
Now stop being so hard
on yourself.

98
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,280
You just need
a good night's sleep.

99
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,370
Maybe you'd like to tell us

100
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,090
why that giant creature was
chasing you so ferociously?

101
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,840
I passed through his
village and demolished it.

102
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,590
Ohh, come on!

103
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,790
Surely your whole life
hasn't been just an accident

104
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,060
waiting to happen?

105
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,630
Well, if you really
wanna know,

106
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,480
it started
when I was just a lad.

107
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,220
<i>My homeland was a
beautiful, tropical garden.</i>

108
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,730
<i>Everything was lush and green.</i>

109
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,460
<i>Me and a couple pals were
kickin' around a kaleidostone</i>

110
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,980
<i>then Hand-me-Down spotted her.</i>

111
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,150
Look!
It's the old witch.

112
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,370
Come on. Follow me.

113
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,290
I got an idea.

114
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,540
Wait for me.

115
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,290
She-she's never
done us any harm.

116
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,510
You don't wanna have fun?
Then just watch.

117
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,580
We're gonna dump her
in her own brew.

118
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,260
Come on, Tattle!

119
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,730
(taunting)

120
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,890
Okay, okay. Wait a sec.
I'm comin'.

121
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,760
Won't leave me alone, eh?

122
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,930
Wanna play rough, do they?

123
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,810
Okay.

124
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,450
All right. You distract her
with the kaleidostone,

125
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,570
while Tattle and I
turn over her pot.

126
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,830
And don't blow it.

127
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,750
Ah, ha!

128
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,700
(hissing)

129
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,040
(bells chime)

130
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,370
Please don't hurt my friends.

131
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,590
They really didn't mean
any harm.

132
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,290
(loud splash)

133
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,290
<i>There I was, floating
in the soup with her,</i>

134
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,190
<i>and was she ever mad.</i>

135
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,720
(walls and roof crumble)

136
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,120
Uh...
It's okay.

137
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,030
Only one wall fell down.

138
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,360
At least, we won't need
an air conditioner.

139
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,950
Come on.

140
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,820
We'll have to find you
another place to sleep tonight.

141
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,900
Good.
Then I can finish my story.

142
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,630
Uh, some other time.

143
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,120
We've had enough excitement
for one night,

144
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,380
thank you.

145
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,890
(dripping)
(thundering)

146
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,500
If I stay here any longer,

147
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,720
Paradise Estate will be anything
but a paradise.

148
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,580
(thundering)
Uh-oh!

149
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,560
(chandelier creaks)

150
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,750
Oh!

151
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,140
Thank goodness
they're heavy sleepers.

152
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,770
Well, at least that didn't fall.

153
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,360
For a second there I thought my
bad luck was working overtime.

154
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,930
(groans in pain)

155
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,660
(sighs sadly)

156
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,280
(sighs sadly)

157
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,920
Gusty. Lickety-Split.

158
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,870
What's the matter?

159
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,210
Woebegone's disappeared.

160
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,460
He's gone.

161
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,540
Oh, good!

162
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,770
If he stayed any longer,

163
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,550
Paradise Estate would've become
a disaster area.

164
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,800
You don't actually believe
that bad luck stuff?

165
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,690
What difference does it make?

166
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,940
All that matters is
that he's hurt.

167
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,520
And that he needs us
to take care of him.

168
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,780
Come on!

169
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,290
If they're gonna bring that
little jinx back,

170
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,400
I'd better reinforce
the whole Estate.

171
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,650

(bushwoolies)
Thank you very much.

189
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,860
Uh-ho!

190
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,190
Look who's back.

191
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,660
And he probably brought his
bad luck with him.

192
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,610
There's no such thing
as bad luck.

193
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,330
And the nursery of Paradise
Estate didn't really collapse,

194
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,200
the moon's made of
green cheese,

195
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,720
and I'm the Queen of England.

196
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,460
Of course, the nursery of
Paradise Estate collapsed,

197
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,330
but no one was hurt.

198
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,160
Lickety-Split's right.

199
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,480
I am bad luck.

200
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,800
And if you don't believe it,
watch.

201
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,140
Ohhhh...
Never mind that.

202
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,390
That old tree,

203
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,890
uh, must have been
filled with termites.

204
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,820
But I am a jinx.

205
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
Run to the Estate fast.

206
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,690
It's dangerous to be
in the same place

207
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,910
as that Woebegone character.

208
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,490
Whoa!
(resisting)

209
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,070
(All gasp)
Help me!

210
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,950
Help!
