(All scream)

11
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,680
Did you do that?

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,630
That was marvelous.

13
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,890
Yes, well, I am a Gnome.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,380
And Gnomes have powers
over earth and stone.

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,880
But we're back to
where we started now.

16
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,950
But the castle's
made out of stone.

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,140
Can't you use your powers
on it to get us in there?

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,770
(struggles)

19
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,230
Not really.

20
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,400
The castle is
magically protected.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,790
I can't do anything with the
stone in it unless I'm inside.

22
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,230
We could catch the castle
without any trouble,

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,800
if it weren't for those
creatures guarding it.

24
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,370
The Undine and the Salamander

25
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,320
uh... a water creature
and a fire creature.

26
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,220
Yeah, them.

27
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,330
If we could just find a
way to dry up the Undine.

28
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,580
Yeah!

29
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,710
Or put out the
Salamander's flame.

30
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,230
We can.
It's simple.

31
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,340
I think she's heard
too many fairytales.

32
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,590
No, no.

33
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,470
It's a perfect plan.

34
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,990
We'll just use them
against each other.

35
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,590
It just might work!

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,940
Let's give it a go!

37
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,350
(loud smash)

38
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,620
Hey, you!
Undine!

39
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,660
Your mother wears galoshes.
(laughs)

40
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,260
(roars)

41
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,920
(Locket)
Yoo-hoo! Salamander.

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,370
(Purple)
Your fire's not that hot.

43
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,290
(Locket)
And neither are you.

44
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,420
(growls angrily)

45
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,340
(teases)
Na, na, brrr!

46
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,640
(chuckles)

47
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,880
(growls)

48
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,350
(gasps in surprise)

49
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,700
(groans)

50
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,860
(All rejoice)
Yeah!

51
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,810
Okay! Let's go before
the castle can pull away

52
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,830
from these mountains again.

53
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,730
Inside! Quickly!

54
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,250
Oh, this is so exciting!

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,490
Boy, it sure is
spooky and confusing.

56
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,640
We could get lost in
here real easy.

57
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,660
We need a guide.

58
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,890
I think I might be
able to provide that.

59
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,400
(incantation)
Show us the way to Ariel.

60
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,850
That's great.

61
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,190
How'd you do that?

62
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,760
It was nothing.

63
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,360
Let's not waste any more time.

64
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,480
I want to find
Ariel, my true love.

65
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,150
Be careful, ponies.

66
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,280
Just because we're inside
doesn't mean it's safe.

67
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,540
We won't have any problem.

68
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,190
Just watch.

69
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,290
Everything's going to
fall right into place.

70
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,450
(gasps)
Whoa!

71
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,250
Are you going to believe
me when I say "be careful"?

72
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,510
I certainly will.

73
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,970
We're almost there.
I can feel it.

74
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,690
Oh, my!

75
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,450
Oh! This is so wonderful!

76
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,240
Ariel, my beloved.
At last, we'll be together.

77
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,320
<i>Look out!</i>

78
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,410
(All scream)

79
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,500
(screams)

80
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,160
We've got to stop them

81
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,710
so that Garth can awaken Ariel
with a kiss.

82
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,460
Oh, really?

83
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,140
I thought we had to stop them
because they'll make

84
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,050
baked Alaska
out of us if we don't.

85
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,250
(Evil laugh)

86
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,220
My wings are soaked.

87
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,420
I can't fly.

88
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,590
Help!

89
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,150
(growls)

90
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,430
Thanks, Heart Throb.
Thanks, Locket.

91
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,990
(growls angrily)

92
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,410
(growls)

93
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,160
Help! Do something!

94
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,660
Get us out of here!
(All scream)

95
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,420
(screams)
Ah!

96
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,040
No! Nothing can happen
to my true love.

97
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,370
(growls)

98
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,010
(loud whirling)
(ponies scream)

99
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
No!

100
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,300
Thanks, Garth.

101
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,390
What can we do?

102
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,050
The castle!

103
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,950
Make the castle shake, Garth.

104
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,190
(groans)

105
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,450
(growls)

106
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,240
(tremoring)

107
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,560
Now is our chance.

108
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,910
Jump on, Garth!

109
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,080
(struggles)

110
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,070
(awakens and sighs)

111
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,590
Look!

112
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,250
Thank you.

113
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,550
Look there!

114
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,800
Oh, my goodness!

115
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,000
Ferdinand! Andrew!

116
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,570
My dear boys, what
are you doing here?

117
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,060
- My lady.
- My lady.

118
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,980
Who are they?

119
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,180
And what are they doing here?

120
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,680
My name is Ferdinand
and this is Andrew.

121
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,180
We were the suitors
for the hand of Ariel

122
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,280
that made her father
cast the spell.

123
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,770
These boys caused
so much trouble,

124
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,040
my father made them my
protectors all these years.

125
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,530
You're not going to take
one of them

126
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,110
for your husband now, are you?

127
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,370
Oh, no, no, no.

128
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,880
They're nice boys, but
they're not for me.

129
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,170
Oh, thank goodness!

130
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,790
Well, thank you all very much
for coming and waking me.

131
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,290
And now I must be going.

132
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,590
Wait! I woke you from the spell.

133
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,190
You're supposed to be mine now.

134
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,210
Look! I don't mean
to be rude or anything,

135
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,730
but the spell wasn't my idea.

136
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,600
I'm not ready to
fall in love yet.

137
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,480
But...but it's not fair.

138
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,060
(All gasp)

139
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,310
What's happening?

140
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,200
The spell's over,
now that Ariel's awake.

141
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,700
The castle's starting to fall.

142
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,820
You didn't land the castle
before you woke me?

143
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,040
Give me a break.

144
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,320
I was busy.

145
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,070
We'd better get out of here!

146
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,640
But there's not enough
of us to carry everybody.

147
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,500
Garth, do something.

148
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,750
Why should I bother?

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,630
I don't care anymore.

150
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,310
(All scream)

151
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,670
Garth, how could you?

152
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,420
- Please!
- You've got to help us!

153
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,020
Please! Not for my
sake, but for theirs.

154
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,530
Any moment the whole
castle will crush.

155
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,280
That's it!
Come on!

156
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,910
Oh! hey!

157
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,750
Make the sand soft, Garth,
like you did before.

158
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,360
Oh, all right.

159
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,960
Look at what he's doing!

160
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,460
Please come back inside.

161
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,430
You could fall...
(All scream)

162
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,350
It worked!
It worked!

163
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,600
Now let's get back to Ariel.

164
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,230
Get away from it, quickly!

165
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,740
That was close!

166
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,230
Are you all right, my beloved?

167
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,200
Fine, thanks.

168
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,150
A little dusty.

169
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:16,540
Well, I guess you'll be on your
way now to begin your new life.

170
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,240
Just a moment!

171
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,870
Garth's right.

172
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,750
It's not fair.

173
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,490
Yeah. Are you sure you
won't change your mind?

174
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,060
Well, there's always
that possibility.

175
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,050
(All)
Goodbye!

176
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,170
(All)
Goodbye!

177
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,770
(All)
- Goodbye! - Farewell!
