(laugh)

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,280
Everyone run for it!

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,460
(grunt and groan)

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,780
You pushed me bagger.

14
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,680
No, you pushed me smacker.

15
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,370
You both pushed me,
and now you're stinking mean.

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,220
Oh! Dear, Ma...

17
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,460
(All panting)

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,050
Everyone hide.
Quickly!

19
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,020
Paradise! The Horseshoe's
illumination will reveal

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,520
our place of concealment
to the goblins.

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,300
Perhaps you can wish it off?

22
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,040
All Little Ponies,

23
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,560
we know you're here.

24
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,740
Yeah. We can read your minds.

25
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,130
You don't like us,
you think we're ugly and mean.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,370
They're right.

27
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,620
(All laugh)

28
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,070
Oh My!

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,420
The goblins just caught
North Star and Spike,

30
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,910
They seem to intuit their
precise locations.

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,430
- What?
- They know where they were.

32
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,420
I'm reading two more minds
right over here.

33
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,670
Ahhhh!

34
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,770
Ma is gonna be
so proud of me.

35
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,560
I got two and you guys
only got one.

36
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,330
And that's all there is.
(laughs)

37
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,070
I thought there was more?

38
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,520
Dummy, we'd read their minds
if there was.

39
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,070
Let's go show Ma...

40
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,240
If the goblins found everyone
by reading their minds,

41
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,760
why didn't they know
we were here?

42
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,000
Perhaps it's the Horseshoes,

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,870
they might cancel out
the telepathic power

44
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,700
of the Goblin's Horseshoe.

45
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,600
Then we can follow them
secretly.

46
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,250
Come on!

47
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,880
(struggling)

48
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,010
That's the 306th time
I won today.

49
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,270
(laughs)

50
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,780
Look what we got Ma...

51
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,940
I got two
and they only got one.

52
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,690
So? Wanna make something of it?

53
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,310
Both of you is thinkin' worser.

54
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,210
Alright, you two's been
asking for it.

55
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,460
Boys!

56
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,990
I like all your presents.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,890
They'll make good little slaves,

58
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,160
and we need slaves.

59
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,930
But what would please
me and your Pa most

60
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,170
would be if you would

61
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,470
STOP FIGHTING!

62
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,550
- Yes Ma.
- Sorry Ma.

63
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,430
It won't happen again Ma.

64
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,940
We'll be good.

65
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,930
Why can't the three of you
learn to get along?

66
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,930

I'm Sorry.

00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,670
I'm Sorrier.

91
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,170
I'm sorriest of all.

92
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,430
No you're not.

93
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,990
Excuse me!

94
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,010
Your sons fight because
the magic Horseshoe you wear

95
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,910
lets them read
each others minds.

96
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,190
If you free us, we will take the
Horseshoe far away from here.

97
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,320
Nonsense!

98
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,270
Goblins don't give things away.

99
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,370
Boys, Pa and I are going in
the back to count our treasures.

100
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,660
We don't want any more arguing,
you hear?

101
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,620
Yes Ma.

102
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,290
I wonder how Mimic is?

103
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,100
It doesn't look like
we could help her much now.

104
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,960
I've done all that
I can for her.

105
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,790
I'm afraid it's not much,

106
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,590
the only thing that can help
her now is the Horseshoes magic.

107
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,970
Well why can't you make
horseshoes for her?

108
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,230
I just might be able to,

109
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,350
but it would take too long
to return to my workshop.

110
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,530
I'll take you, I'll take you!
That's not problem.

111
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,190
It's no problem at all.

112
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,520
If any of us can get you there
in time, it's me.

113
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,730
I can get ya home in a wink.
I'm the fastest flyer here.

114
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,320
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

115
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,360
Then, what are we waiting for?

116
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,400
(snoring)

117
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
It's Paradise and Wind Whistler.

118
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,820
Hey, whatÂ's the big Idea?

119
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,720
Who do you think
you're hitting?

120
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,410
Oh boy, are we glad to see you.

121
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,840
The Slaves are escaping!

122
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,310
(fighting loudly)

123
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,220
See what your fighting has done?

124
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,390
Keep going, Lofty.
I'll catch up.

125
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,480
I've been robbed!

126
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,660
Ma we're sorry.

127
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,520
We'll get it back.

128
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,770
(All)
Oh yeah, Ma, sure we will!
I promise, I promise!

129
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,770
And I am sorry.
I was hittin' you guys.

130
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,250
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I punched you in the face.

131
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,760
Well, I'm sorry I was, you know,

132
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,250
jumping up and down
on your legs.

133
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,750
Oh!
Forget the Horseshoe boys.

134
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,850
We've got something better.

135
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,960
We got our family spirit back.

136
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,430
Bat's Wings... Tail of Newt...

137
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,680
(loud explosion)

138
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,960
Oh! Oh!

139
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,440
The magic involved is just
too strong for me to control.

140
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,530
(Spike sighs)
Now where do we go?

141
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,440
According to the power
of this Horseshoe,

142
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,540
the last one is near
but up high.

143
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,320
Look up there
on that high peek.

144
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,540
I've been there,

145
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,660
it's the home of
the green mountain elves.

146
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,070
It's awfully high up.

147
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,050
Do you think we can make it?

148
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,170
The air's thin up there,

149
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,490
but breathable.

150
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,760
Let's go!

151
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,720
I-I hope the others can make it,

152
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,220
it's a long way down.

153
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,050
(gasping for air)

154
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,850
Northstar. Wind whistler.
Help!

155
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,510
Air is too thin...
I can't breathe...

156
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,830
Come on, we'll make it together.

157
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,180
It doesn't look friendly.

158
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,080
It was built to be deceiving.

159
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,740
Warm welcome Lofty to you
and your friends.

160
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,670
I am Cara, keeper of the gate
to the Mountain Elf Kingdom.

161
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,590
What quest brings you here?

162
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,330
We're looking for
a magic Horseshoe,

163
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,210
that can take you
wherever you wish.

164
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,710
We need it to save
our friend's life!

165
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,970
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,090
It is not within my power
to give it to you.

167
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,300
It belongs to the child,
Princess Mave.

168
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,810
And according to Elven Laws,

169
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,380
no one may take anything
from a child,

170
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,530
unless the child
surrenders it willingly.

171
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,020
May we ask Mave
for the Horseshoe?

172
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,690
Yes. I'll take you to her.

173
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,360
(giggling)

174
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,370
Oh!
Come to play with Mave?

175
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,820
No, Mave.

176
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,040
This is Megan,
she has a favor to ask of you.

177
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,070
Ask.

178
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,790
A unicorn is very sick,

179
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,330
your magic Horseshoe
is needed to cure her.

180
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,580
Will you give it to us?

181
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,830
No.

182
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,330
Horseshoe Mave's!
Fun to play with.

183
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,580
Watch!

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,500
Hey, wait...help!

185
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,730
(All gasp)

186
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,900
See?

187
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,110
Horseshoe make fun for Mave
all day.

188
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,850
Now we go under the ocean
for more fun.

189
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,100
Uhh...let's not.

190
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,530
We've seen why you
want the Horseshoe.

191
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,450
Now let's go to Dream Valley
so you can see

192
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,280
why we need the Horseshoe.

193
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,190
Okay! Dream Valley.

194
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,130
(starts sobbing)

195
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,260
Here. Pony needs Horseshoe
more than Mave.

196
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,510
Thank you! Thank You!

197
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,060
Megan? Megan!

198
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,930
We have all the Horseshoes.

199
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,110
Give them to me, quickly.

200
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,440
(gasps)

201
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,780
Mimic, are you better?

202
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,320
All better. Thank you all.

203
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,880
(cheers)

204
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,160
(Mave sighs with relief)

205
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,410
We did it!
