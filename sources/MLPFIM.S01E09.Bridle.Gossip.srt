1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,783
Twilight: Wow, what a gorgeous day!

2
00:00:04,783 --> 00:00:07,802
Spike: Rainbow Dash must've gotten up early for 
 once and cleared all the clouds away.

3
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:11,796
Twilight: I bet all of Ponyville is gonna be out enjoying the sunshine.

4
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:15,186
...What? Where IS everypony?

5
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:17,266
(window slams shut)

6
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:21,107
(door slams)

7
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,754
Spike: Is it some sort of pony holiday?

8
00:00:23,754 --> 00:00:25,054
Twilight: Not that I know of.

9
00:00:25,054 --> 00:00:29,234
Spike: Does my breath stink? (breathes fire)

10
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:30,766
Twilight: Not more than usual.

11
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:33,042
Spike: Is it...ZOMBIES?!

12
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:35,039
Twilight: Uh...not very likely.

13
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,872
Spike: (apprehensively) Not likely...but...possible?!

14
00:00:41,587 --> 00:00:43,352
Pinkie Pie: (hushed) Psst! Twilight!

15
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:44,931
Spike!

16
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:45,906
Come here!

17
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:48,228
Come! Here!

18
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:50,039
HURRY!

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,711
Before she GETS you!

20
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:52,872
(door slams)

21
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:56,773
(light clicks on, Twilight grunts)
Spike: (fearful) Who?! The zombie pony?!

22
00:00:56,773 --> 00:00:59,095
Pinkie Pie: (voice trembling) Zoooombie poooony?!

23
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:00,767
(Spike shudders)

24
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:02,717
Twilight: Spike! There are NO zombie ponies!

25
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:05,689
Pinkie! What are you doing here alone in the dark?

26
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:07,361
Pinkie Pie: I'm not alone in the dark.

27
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:08,801
(Twilight gasps)

28
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:11,105
Twilight: Okay then, what are you ALL doing here in the dark?

29
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:13,770
Applejack: (stammering) We-we're hidin' from h-h-her!

30
00:01:13,077 --> 00:01:15,007
(draws curtain)

31
00:01:16,788 --> 00:01:18,832
(hoof scraping dirt)

32
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:25,101
(all except Twilight gasp)

33
00:01:27,098 --> 00:01:34,025
(theme song begins) My Little Pony, My Little Pony, ah, ah, ah, ah,

34
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:38,429
(My Little Pony) Twilight: I used to wonder what friendship could be

35
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:42,042
(My Little Pony) Until you all shared its magic with me

36
00:01:42,423 --> 00:01:44,076
Rainbow Dash: Big adventure
Pinkie Pie: Tons of fun

37
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:46,093
Rarity: A beautiful heart
Applejack: Faithful and strong

38
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:48,097
Fluttershy: Sharing kindness
Twilight: It's an easy feat

39
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:51,034
All: And magic makes it all complete, yeah

40
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:59,079
(My Little Pony) Do you know, you're all my very best friends

41
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:06,062
(Spike grunts)
Applebloom: Did you see her, Twilight? Did you see Zecora?

42
00:02:11,773 --> 00:02:14,056
Pinkie Pie: (exaggerated) Glance EEEVILLY this way!

43
00:02:14,056 --> 00:02:17,025
Twilight: And then a bunch of you flip out for no good reason!

44
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:19,011
Applejack: No good reason?!

45
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:21,076
You call protectin' yer kin "no good reason?"

46
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:25,015
Why, as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town,

47
00:02:25,148 --> 00:02:27,056
(Applebloom shaking audibly)
she started SHAKIN' in her little horseshoes!

48
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:29,037
Applebloom: (voice shaking) Di-i-i-d n-o-o-o-t!

49
00:02:29,374 --> 00:02:31,028
Applejack: So I swept her up and brought 'er here.

50
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:33,046
Applebloom: I walked here myself!

51
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:34,090
Applejack: For safekeepin'!

52
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:38,052
Applebloom: (rebellious) Applejack! I'm not a baby! I can take care o'myself!

53
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:41,026
Applejack: Not from that creepy Zecora.

54
00:02:41,263 --> 00:02:43,021
Fluttershy: She's mysterious.

55
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:47,016
Rainbow Dash: Sinister.
Pinkie Pie: (exaggerated) And SPO-O-O-O-OKY!

56
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:50,097
(Twilight grunts)

57
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:55,047
(all except Twilight gasp)

58
00:02:55,473 --> 00:02:57,042
Twilight: Will you cut that out?!

59
00:02:57,424 --> 00:03:00,067
Rarity: Just LOOK at those stripes! So garish!

60
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:02,067
Twilight: She's a zebra.

61
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:04,011
Everyone but Twilight: A WHAT?!

62
00:03:04,111 --> 00:03:07,087
Twilight: A zebra! And her stripes aren't a fashion choice, Rarity.

63
00:03:07,873 --> 00:03:09,064
They're what she was born with.

64
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:11,031
(Rarity faints theatrically)

65
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:17,007
Applejack: Born WHERE?! I've never seen a pony 
 like that in these parts...'cept... (shudders) her!

66
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:19,011
Twilight: Well, she's probably not from here.

67
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:20,041
And she's not a pony.

68
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:23,024
(hoof scratching dirt)
My book says zebras come from a faraway land.

69
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,052
(door opens quietly)
But I've never seen her in Ponyville.

70
00:03:25,052 --> 00:03:26,068
Where does she live?

71
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:32,025
(spooky theremin music)
Applejack: That's just it. She lives in...THE EVERFREE FOREST!

72
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:33,030
(loud thunder-like crash)

73
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:35,002
Twilight: SPIKE!
(loud thunder-like crash)

74
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:36,083
Spike: (sheepishly) Heh...sorry.

75
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:39,094
Applejack: The Everfree Forest just ain't natural.

76
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:41,029
The plants grow.

77
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:43,056
Fluttershy: Animals care for themselves...

78
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:47,083
Rainbow Dash: And the clouds move...
All three: ALL ON THEIR OWN!

79
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:49,051
(Rarity faints theatrically)

80
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:53,082
Pinkie Pie: And that wicked enchantress Zecora lives there doing her evil...uh...STUFF!

81
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:56,015
She's so evil, I even wrote a song about her!

82
00:03:56,147 --> 00:03:57,035
Rainbow Dash: (sarcastic) Here we go...

83
00:03:57,354 --> 00:04:00,037
Pinkie Pie: (singing frantically) She's an evil enchantress
She does evil dances

84
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,030
And if you look deep in her eyes
She'll put you in trances

85
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,081
Then what will she do?
She'll mix up an evil brew

86
00:04:05,806 --> 00:04:08,045
And she'll gobble you up
In a big tasty stew

87
00:04:08,454 --> 00:04:09,085
Sooo...WATCH OUT! (song ends)

88
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:12,080
(panting heavily)

89
00:04:12,796 --> 00:04:14,010
Twilight: Wow. Catchy.

90
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:15,063
Pinkie Pie: It's a work in progress.

91
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:18,018
Twilight: This is all just a bunch of gossip and rumors.

92
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:21,090
Now tell me, what exactly have you SEEN Zecora do?

93
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:27,043
Rainbow Dash: Well...once a month, she comes into Ponyville.

94
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,060
Twilight: (mocking) Ooooh.

95
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,079
Rarity: Then she lurks by the stores.

96
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,023
Twilight: (mocking) Oh MY!

97
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:36,057
Fluttershy: And then, she digs at the ground...

98
00:04:36,573 --> 00:04:38,052
Twilight: (hyperbolic) Good gracious!

99
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:42,005
(normally) Okay, I'm sorry. But how is any of this bad?

100
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:44,019
Maybe she comes to town to visit.

101
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:47,016
Applebloom: Yeah! Maybe she's just tryin' t'be neighborly!

102
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,083
Twilight: And maybe she's not LURKING by the stores.

103
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,025
Maybe she's GOING to them, lurk-free,

104
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:53,050
to do some shopping?

105
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:55,096
Applebloom: Yeah! Everypony likes to shop!

106
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,082
Applebloom: You know what I think?
Applejack: APPLEBLOOM!

107
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:59,035
Hush and let the big ponies talk!

108
00:04:59,352 --> 00:05:01,040
Applebloom: (pouting) I AM a big pony!

109
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:04,032
Rainbow Dash: What about digging at the ground?

110
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:06,060
You gotta admit THAT'S weird.

111
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:09,080
Fluttershy: What if she's digging for innocent creatures?

112
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:13,000
(Pinkie Pie singing "Evil Enchantress" in the background)
Twilight: I'm 
 sure there's an explanation for everything Zecora does.

113
00:05:13,005 --> 00:05:16,081
And if ANYPONY here were actually brave enough to approach her,

114
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:18,016
she would find out the truth.

115
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:21,092
Applebloom: Well, I'm brave enough! I'm gonna find out myself!

116
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:26,061
(Applebloom gasps, gulps)

117
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:34,067
(hoof scrapes dirt)

118

Download GOM Player to experience 
the highest video and audio quality!

119
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:45,040
Twilight: You ponies are being RIDICULOUS!

120
00:05:45,397 --> 00:05:49,011
Pinkie Pie: (ominously) Well, I heard that Zecora eats HAY.

121
00:05:49,112 --> 00:05:52,027
Twilight: (exasperated) Pinkie. I eat hay. YOU eat hay.

122
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:56,012
Pinkie Pie: Yeah, but I heard it's the EVIL way she eats hay.

123
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:58,045
Applejack: (worried) Hey! Where's Applebloom?!

124
00:05:58,446 --> 00:06:00,007
Fluttershy: The door's open!

125
00:06:00,072 --> 00:06:01,088
Rarity: She went outside?!

126
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:04,011
Rainbow Dash: And Zecora's still out there!

127
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:07,055
Applejack: (worried) That silly little filly! I told her to stay put!

128
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:10,089
Twilight: Spike, you stay here in case Applebloom comes back.

129
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:12,033
Spike: Will do!

130
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:26,047
(strange noises)

131
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:27,029
(Applebloom gulps)

132
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:37,092
Applejack: Applebloom?!

133
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,041
(Applebloom gasps)

134
00:06:39,406 --> 00:06:42,001
Applejack: You get back here right now!

135
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:47,044
Zecora: (African accent, speaking in meter) Beware! Beware, you pony 
 folk! Those leaves of blue are not a joke!

136
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:52,004
Applejack: You keep yer creepy mumbo-jumbo to yerself, ya hear?!

137
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:57,047
(ponies talking over each other, Pinkie Pie singing "Evil Enchantress")

138
00:06:57,472 --> 00:06:58,040
Twilight: (sighs) Oh brother.

139
00:06:58,004 --> 00:07:02,002
Zecora: (fading) Beware! BEWARE!

140
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:04,067
Rainbow Dash: Yeah, back atcha, Zecora!

141
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:08,001
You and your...lame...curse are the ones who better beware!

142
00:07:08,013 --> 00:07:11,059
Applejack: And YOU! Why couldn't you just listen to your big sister?!

143
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:13,026
Applebloom: (stammering) I...I...

144
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:16,005
Applejack: Who knows what kinda nasty curse Zecora coulda just put on you?!

145
00:07:16,048 --> 00:07:17,077
Pinkie Pie: Just like in my song!

146
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:21,055
(singing) Evil enchantress, with the dances, and the trances

147
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:24,020
Twilight: You guys! There's no such thing as curses!

148
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:28,080
Rainbow Dash: Well, that's interesting to hear, coming from Miss Magic-pants herself.

149
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:32,014
Twilight: My magic - REAL magic - comes from within.

150
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:33,081
It's a skill you're born with.

151
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:36,013
Curses are artificial. Fake magic.

152
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:38,073
It's conjured with potions and incantations.

153
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:40,040
All smoke and mirrors meant to scare.

154
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:44,007
But curses have no real power. They're just an old pony tale.

155
00:07:44,026 --> 00:07:50,099
Applejack: Just you wait, Twilight. You're gonna learn 
 that some pony tales really are true.

156
00:07:55,073 --> 00:07:59,086
Pinkie Pie: (singing) She's an evil enchantress, she 
 does evil dances
(Twilight dreaming other characters' voices)

157
00:07:59,864 --> 00:08:02,093
Zecora: Beware! BEWARE!
(Twilight dreaming other characters' voices)

158
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:07,053
Pinkie Pie: (singing) If you look deep in her eyes, 
 she will put you in trances
(Twilight dreaming other characters)

159
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:11,045
Rainbow Dash: Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!
Rarity: Wicked, 
 wicked diva! Fluttershy: A curse...
(Twilight dreaming other characters' voices)

160
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:13,082
Pinkie Pie: (singing) Then what will she do?
(Twilight dreaming other characters' voices)

161
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:17,090
Applejack: Just you wait, Twilight. Some pony tales 
 really are true.
(Twilight dreaming other characters' voices)

162
00:08:17,905 --> 00:08:21,002
Pinkie Pie: (singing) Then she'll gobble you up in 
 a big tasty stew
(Twilight dreaming other characters' voices)

163
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:25,034
Pinkie Pie: Soooo...WATCH OUT! (Zecora laughs sinisterly)
(Twilight dreaming other characters' voices)

164
00:08:26,868 --> 00:08:28,017
(Twilight whimpering in sleep)

165
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:30,072
(rooster crows)

166
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:33,042
Twilight: (groggily) Ugh...what a dream...

167
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,055
Curses-shmurses.

168
00:08:35,553 --> 00:08:39,064
Whoa! (chuckles) Maybe Zecora cursed my hair.

169
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:44,093
(laughs nervously, gasps)

170
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:46,037
(panicked) Or she cursed my horn!

171
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:51,006
Twilight: No, no, no, no, NO!

172
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,025
None of these books have a cure!

173
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:56,054
(horn flops)
(groans) There has to be a real reason for this!

174
00:08:56,543 --> 00:08:58,063
An illness? An allergy?!

175
00:08:58,633 --> 00:08:59,093
Spike: A curse!

176
00:08:59,934 --> 00:09:01,084
Twilight: I said a real reason.

177
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:04,007
Something that points to something real.

178
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:05,074
Spike: How about this one?

179
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:07,074
Twilight: (reading) "Supernaturals?"

180
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:12,084
Spike, the word "supernatural" refers to things like ghosts, and spirits, and zombies,

181
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,089
which are as make-believe as curses.

182
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,067
This book is just a bunch of hooey!

183
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:19,095
Spike: But what if you're wrong, Twilight?

184
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:21,099
Spike: What if this really is a-
Pinkie Pie: (garbled) A THURTH!

185
00:09:22,968 --> 00:09:24,078
Spike: A purse?! How could it be a purse?

186
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,033
Twilight: Pinkie! What happened?!

187
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,028
Pinkie Pie: (garbled, spitting) Ipth wapth Zeporptha!

188
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:31,010
Spthe thputh a curth on me!

189
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:33,051
Spike: Augh! Say it, don't spray it, Pinkie!
(loud thud)

190
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:34,076
Rainbow Dash: Ow!

191
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:36,016
(loud thud) Oh!

192
00:09:36,157 --> 00:09:38,099
She's (thud) trying to say-ow!

193
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,080
Zecora- (thud, grunt)

194
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:44,038
(door crashes open) She slapped us all with a- (thud) ow! Curse.

195
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:46,019
Rarity: I'm afraid I have to agree.

196
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:47,091
(blows hair out of face)

197
00:09:47,906 --> 00:09:48,093
(Spike and Twilight yelp in surprise)

198
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:51,025
Applejack: (high-pitched voice) I hate to say I told ya so, Twilight,

199
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,094
but I told ya so!

200
00:09:52,945 --> 00:09:53,097
(Twilight and Spike gasp)

201
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:55,080
Applejack: it's a curse, I tells ya!

202
00:09:55,802 --> 00:09:58,098
Twilight: But...Fluttershy...seems just fine.

203
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:02,028
Rarity: Yes, there doesn't seem to be a THING wrong with her.

204
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,034
Twilight: Fluttershy? Are you okay?

205
00:10:06,877 --> 00:10:08,036
Is there something wrong with you?

206
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:11,034
Twilight: ...Would you care to tell us?

207
00:10:12,682 --> 00:10:15,005
(horn flopping)
So...you're NOT gonna tell us?

208
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:18,049
Yes you're not, or yes you will?

209
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:21,074
Applejack: Good gravy, girl! What's wrong with you?!

210
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:25,017
Fluttershy: (baritone manly voice) I don't wanna talk about it...

211
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:27,087
(Spike snorts and bursts into raucous laughter)

212
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:29,096
Spike: This is HILARIOUS! (laughing)

213
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:31,058
Look at all of you! We got:

214
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,046
Hairity [Rarity],

215
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,009
Rainbow Crash [Dash],

216
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,039
Spittie [Pinkie] Pie,

217
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,064
Appleteeny [appletini],

218
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:37,048
Flutterguy [Fluttershy],

219
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:39,024
and...uh...

220
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:41,020
I got nothin'.

221
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:44,096
"Twilight Sparkle." I mean, seriously. I can't even work with that.

222
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:47,035
Twilight: (sarcastic laughter) This is no joke, Spike.
(horn flops noisily)

223
00:10:47,349 --> 00:10:50,011
Now start looking for more books so I can find a cure!
(horn flops noisily)

224
00:10:50,112 --> 00:10:51,093
(Spike groans)

225
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:56,034
(Rainbow Dash strains, pops out of ladder)

226
00:10:56,335 --> 00:10:59,068
Rainbow Dash: I think we'll find a cure to this curse at Zecora's place!

227
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,016
Twilight: It's not a curse!
(Rainbow Dash crashes)

228
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:04,004
Applejack: I agree with Dash!

229
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:07,067
We'll go to Zecora's and force her to remove this hex!
(Rainbow Dash zips around)

230
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,043
Twilight: It's not a hex either!

231
00:11:09,431 --> 00:11:13,061
(all but Applebloom arguing)

232
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:15,079
Applebloom: This is all my fault.

233
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:19,046
If I hadn't followed Zecora in the first place, none of this would've happened.

234
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:21,051
I just gotta fix this.

235
00:11:22,852 --> 00:11:25,041
Applejack: Now, where does she think she's goin' this time?!

236
00:11:28,332 --> 00:11:30,042
Rainbow Dash: I don't care what you say, Twilight!

237
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:33,026
It's time to pony up and confront Zecora!

238
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:35,039
Come on, girls! Are you with me?!

239
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:36,064
Pinkie Pie: I ampth!

240
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:37,073
Rarity: And I, as well.

241
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:42,003
Fluttershy: Uh, I don't know. Seems awfully dangerous.

242
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:44,035
(Spike giggles)

243
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:47,025
Rainbow Dash: How 'bout you, Applejack? ...Applejack?

244
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:49,014
Pinkie Pie: She'thp gonthe!

245
00:11:49,137 --> 00:11:51,074
Rarity: (panicked shriek) Or somepony stepped on her!

246
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,031
Twilight: Or...sat on her?
(horn flops)

247
00:11:58,121 --> 00:11:59,068
Rainbow Dash: Rarity's hair!

248
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,065
Rarity: (squealing) Oh! OH! Pinkie, what are you doing?!

249
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:06,000
Really! (squeals) You ever hear of personal space?!

250
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:07,041
Pinkie Pie: Nopeth.

251
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:09,013
Twilight: Applebloom is gone too!

252
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:11,045
Rainbow Dash: I bet they went after Zecora!

253
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:12,094
Twilight: Well, we better go find them.

254
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:15,054
(Rainbow Dash crashes)
Twilight: Come on, girls, let's go.

255
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:17,086
Rarity: (strains theatrically) Oh dear!

256
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:19,086
Oh, this is SO unseemly!

257
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:20,067
(exaggerated yelp)

258
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:22,067
Rainbow Dash: (dragging along floor) Hey! A little help, here?

259
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:25,027
Fluttershy: Oopsie! Sorry.

260
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:27,036
(sound of plane spinning out of control, crash)

261
00:12:27,357 --> 00:12:29,036
Rainbow Dash: OW!

262
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:33,095
Fluttershy: Uh, Spike? Are you coming?

263
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:38,046
Spike: Nope! Uh...gotta stay here and look for a cure.

264
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,010
(gasps) "Twilight Flopple!" [Sparkle]

265
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,070
Applejack: Stop right there!

266
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:51,027
Turn around right now, missy!

267
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:53,050
Applebloom: (rebellious) No.

268
00:12:53,503 --> 00:12:57,059
Applejack: No?! You can't ignore a direct order from your big sister!

269
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:59,063
(Applejack grunts)

270
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:02,078
Applebloom: (giggles) Sorry, Applejack,

271
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,088
but I'M the big sister now.

272
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:08,050
Applejack: Applebloom! You come back here right this instant!

273
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:11,034
(blustering) I'M GONNA TELL BIG MACINTOSH ON YOU!

274
00:13:12,636 --> 00:13:14,054
(upset) Aw, ponyfeathers.

275
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:19,051
Twilight: Come on, girls! We've got to get to Zecora's!

276
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:21,078
Hurry!
(Rarity trips)

277
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:25,031
Rarity: (yelps) Easier said than done!

278
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:27,050
Rainbow Dash: Hey! Wait for me!

279
00:13:27,497 --> 00:13:30,089
(Rainbow Dash screams, sound of plane spinning out of control, crash)

280
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:33,091
(Rainbow Dash groans, tree falls)

281
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:38,004
Applejack: Rainbow! Thank Celestia!

282
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,057
There's no time to lose!

283
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:42,078
(banjo music)

284
00:13:42,776 --> 00:13:45,061
I need to get to Zecora's, pronto!

285
00:13:45,609 --> 00:13:46,077
Giddyap, pony!

286
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:48,091
Rainbow Dash: Ex-CUSE me?

287
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:51,000
Applejack: (kicks Rainbow Dash's thigh) YEE-HAW!

288
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,095
Rainbow Dash: What the?!

289
00:13:52,946 --> 00:13:56,080
Applejack: No, Rainbow Dash! Other way!

290
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:04,074
Rarity: (theatrically) Oh! I look HORRIBLE!

291
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:07,030
Pinkie Pie: Thish plashp looksh horriplesh!

292
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:10,069
Rarity: Oh my. That place really DOES look horrible!

293
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:14,036
Rarity: Nice decorations.

294
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:16,017
If you like CREEPY!

295
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,007
(door opens)

296
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:20,053
(ponies gasp)

297
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:25,006
(cauldron bubbling)

298
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:30,012
(Zecora speaking native language)

299
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:31,065
Pinkie Pie: She shtole my sthong!

300
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:33,088
She (unintelligible babble)!

301
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:35,065
Rarity: She stole your song?

302
00:14:35,648 --> 00:14:38,067
Twilight: Oh, Pinkie. That doesn't sound anything like your song.

303
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,011
Pinkie: (blows air over tongue) ...Ah!

304
00:14:40,106 --> 00:14:41,087
(Pinkie tries and fails to talk)

305
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:43,012
(inquisitive yelp)

306
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:46,061
(Fluttershy sighs)

307
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:51,062
Fluttershy: (singing baritone unenthusiastically) She's an evil enchantress
She does evil dances

308
00:14:51,623 --> 00:14:56,004
And if you look deep in her eyes
She will put you in trances

309
00:14:56,035 --> 00:14:59,029
Then what will she do?
She'll mix up an evil brew

310
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:03,014
Then she'll gobble you up
In a big tasty stew

311
00:15:03,014 --> 00:15:06,044
Soooo...watch out.

312
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:10,080
Rarity: YOU saw those terrible things! NOW do you believe us, Twilight?!

313
00:15:12,521 --> 00:15:16,070
Twilight: Scary looking masks, confusing incantations, and a great big bubbling cauldron?

314
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:21,081
(horn flopping)
(sighs) Everything IS pointing to Zecora being...bad!

315
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:25,085
Or...what if Zecora's just making soup?

316
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:31,061
Zecora: (tastes soup, speaking in meter) Mmm. The perfect temperature for ponies, I presume.

317
00:15:31,608 --> 00:15:35,060
Now, where is that little Applebloom?

318
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:39,055
Twilight: (fearful) Or...what if she's making Applebloom Soup?

319
00:15:41,221 --> 00:15:44,038
What if she's making Applebloom Soup?

320
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:46,072
(ponies scream, Fluttershy in a very low pitch)

321
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:48,077
(Rainbow Dash screams)

322
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:51,023
Applejack: I'm comin' for ya, Applebloom!

323
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:57,040
(door crashes open, Zecora speaks native language frantically, Rainbow 
 Dash crashes into various things)
Applejack: Whoa there!

324
00:15:57,405 --> 00:16:00,047
Easy, Rainbow Crash!
(glass breaks, Zecora speaks native language)

325
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:03,054
(Rainbow Dash screams, Zecora speaks native language, door slams, horn flops)

326
00:16:03,535 --> 00:16:05,081
Twilight: (horn flops) What have you done with Applebloom?!

327
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:08,092
Zecora: No! No! (speaks native language)
(Rainbow Dash screams, crashes)

328
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:12,027
(rope twirls)

329
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:18,097
(Applejack grunts repeatedly, Rainbow Dash screams)

330
00:16:18,097 --> 00:16:20,049
(crash)

331
00:16:20,486 --> 00:16:24,020
Zecora: Ponies! What is this you-
(Rainbow Dash screams, cauldron falls over and spills contents)

332
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:30,014
(speaking in meter) No! You know not what you do! You've 
 gone and spilled my precious brew!
(stew pours onto ground)

333
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:32,010
Twilight: We're onto you, Zecora!

334
00:16:32,096 --> 00:16:36,009
I didn't want to believe you cursed us, but the evidence is overwhelming!

335
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:38,007
Rarity: You made me look ridiculous!

336
00:16:38,068 --> 00:16:40,006
Fluttershy: You made me SOUND ridiculous!

337
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:43,007
(Pinkie Pie talks and spits unintelligibly)

338
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:45,002
Twilight: (horn flops) You ruined my horn!

339
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,000
Zecora: How dare you?!

340
00:16:46,957 --> 00:16:52,008
(speaking in meter) You destroy my home, destroy my work, 
 then rudely accuse me of being a jerk?!

341
00:16:52,808 --> 00:16:56,006
Rainbow Dash: You put this curse on us, now you're gonna UNcurse us!

342
00:16:56,057 --> 00:17:02,005
Zecora: (speaking in meter) It is unwise to venture down this 
 road. Your actions will make my anger explode!
(ponies gasp)

343
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:05,000
Twilight: (accusatory, horn flops) Where is Applebloom?

344
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:09,004
(Twilight and Zecora butt heads)
Applebloom: Zecora! I think I 
 found all the things ya asked for.

345
00:17:09,387 --> 00:17:12,008
What in Ponyville is goin' on here?!

346
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,001
Applejack: (gasps) Applebloom!

347
00:17:15,146 --> 00:17:16,004
You're okay!

348
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:17,006
Applebloom: Why wouldn't I be?

349
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:21,007
Twilight: Because Zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us 
 and was going to cook you up into soup!

350
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:23,003
(horn flops)

351
00:17:23,273 --> 00:17:25,006
(Zecora and Applebloom laugh)
Applebloom: Oh, Twilight!

352
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:28,005
Did those silly fillies finally get in yer head?

353
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:30,007
Y'know there's no such thing as a curse!

354
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:35,002
Twilight: (horn flops, condescending) Applebloom, sweetie, you can't just stand 
 there and tell me this isn't a curse!

355
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,003
Applebloom: (flatly) This isn't a curse.

356
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:42,000
Zecora: (metric) If you will remember back, the words I spoke were quite exact.

357
00:17:41,988 --> 00:17:48,000
(in flashback) Beware! Beware, you ponyfolk! Those leaves of blue are not a joke!

358
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,008
Applebloom: It was a warning.

359
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:54,002
About that blue plant. It's called Poison Joke.

360
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:59,008
Zecora: That plant is much like poison oak, 
 but its results are like a joke.

361
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:02,003
Applejack: WHAT in the hay does that mean?

362
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:08,006
Zecora: It means this plant does not breed wrath. 
 Instead, this plant just wants a laugh.

363
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:12,002
Applejack: Will SOMEpony please talk normal?!

364
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:18,000
Twilight: I think what she's saying is that when we ran 
 in to save Applebloom, we ran into the Poison Joke.

365
00:18:18,025 --> 00:18:21,003
All our problems were just little jokes it played on us.

366
00:18:21,322 --> 00:18:23,001
Applejack: "LITTLE" jokes?!

367
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:24,004
(sarcastic) Very funny.

368
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:27,006
Rainbow Dash: Ok, fine. But what about the cauldron?

369
00:18:27,595 --> 00:18:29,001
Fluttershy: And the chanting?

370
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:30,006
Rarity: And the creepy decor?

371
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:38,007
Zecora: Treasures of the native land where I am 
 from. This one speaks 'hello', and this 'welcome'.

372
00:18:38,737 --> 00:18:41,004
Rarity: Not welcoming at all, if you ask me.

373
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:46,008
Zecora: The words I chanted were from olden 
 times. Something you call a nursery rhyme.

374
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:50,007
Twilight: But the cauldron...The Applebloom Soup?

375
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,003
Applebloom: Lookie here, Twilight!

376
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:54,001
That pot o'water wasn't for me!

377
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:56,001
It was for all these herbal ingredients!

378
00:18:56,106 --> 00:18:59,005
The cure for Poison Joke is a simple old natural remedy!

379
00:18:59,543 --> 00:19:01,007
You just gotta take a bubble bath!

380
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,006
Twilight: (horn flops) But I tried to find a cure in all my 
 books and couldn't find anything. What book has this natural remedy?

381
00:19:08,645 --> 00:19:14,000
Zecora: Here is the book, you see? Sad 
 that you lack it in your library.

382
00:19:14,032 --> 00:19:21,006
Twilight: (embarrassed) Actually, I do have this book, but I 
 didn't look inside because the title was so... Weird.

383
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:26,007
Twilight: (reading) "Supernaturals: Natural Remedies and Cure-alls That Are Simply Super."

384
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:30,007
(humbled) I...I...I'm so sorry, Zecora.

385
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:34,009
(horn flops)
I had the answer the whole time, if 
 only I had bothered to look inside.

386
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:41,008
Zecora: [chuckle] Maybe next time you will take a second 
 look, and not judge the cover of the book.

387
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,001
(Applebloom giggles)

388
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:47,007
Twilight: Zecora? Would you be kind enough to mix 
 up another batch of the herbal bath?

389
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:53,002
Zecora: Mix it up I certainly will. Yet 
 I am missing an herb from Ponyville.

390
00:19:53,181 --> 00:19:58,001
Applebloom: But whenever Zecora comes to town, all the shops are mysteriously closed!

391
00:19:58,057 --> 00:20:01,007
Twilight: (horn flops) Oh, well...I think we can help you with that. 

392
00:20:01,726 --> 00:20:05,005
(ponies chattering)

393
00:20:05,487 --> 00:20:07,006
Daisy: Look, Rose! How awful!

394
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,001
Rose: The wicked enchantress has cursed them all!

395
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:12,009
Lily: The horror! The horror!

396
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:21,001
(ponies screaming over each other, doors slamming)

397
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:22,003
(Twilight knocks on door)

398
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:24,008
Twilight: Daisy? We need to talk.

399
00:20:26,617 --> 00:20:28,002
Twilight: (voice-over) "Dear Princess Celestia,

400
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:31,006
my friends and I all learned an important lesson this week:

401
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,009
Never judge a book by its cover.

402
00:20:33,908 --> 00:20:36,009
Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary.

403
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:40,002
But you have to look past that and learn who they are inside.

404
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:45,002
Real friends don't care what your cover is; It's 
 the contents of a pony that count.

405
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:49,002
And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever.

406
00:20:49,234 --> 00:20:51,009
Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

407
00:20:51,927 --> 00:20:58,000
Lotus: Miss Zecora. I would love to get the 
 recipe for this bath. It's simply luxurious!

408
00:20:58,011 --> 00:21:02,002
Applebloom: (realizing) Applejack! Hey, where's Applejack?!

409
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:03,009
(ponies gasping and splashing loudly)

410
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:07,000
Applejack: I'm right here, li'l sis!

411
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:08,008
I ain't tiny no more!

412
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:14,004
Rarity: Ooh. I have never felt so lovely in all my life!
(splash)

413
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:17,006
Pinkie Pie: Oh my gosh! I've never realized how horrible 
 it is to not be able to talk.

414
00:21:17,585 --> 00:21:20,009
I mean I love talking so much and when I 
 couldn't talk 'cause my tongue was all 'ehhhh'.

415
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:23,006
It was the worst! Don't you agree, Fluttershy?

416
00:21:24,876 --> 00:21:26,004
Fluttershy: (normal voice) Yes.

417
00:21:26,362 --> 00:21:30,004
(ponies laugh)

418
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:32,007
(ending theme begins) My Little Pony

419
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:37,000
My Little Pony

420
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:48,000
(instrumental)

421
00:21:48,003 --> 00:21:54,005
My Little Pony, friends
