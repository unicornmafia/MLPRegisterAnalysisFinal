(Bull snorting)

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,010
(Both)
MEGAN!

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,060
He doesn't look
very happy to see us.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,110
We can't stay here,
Morning Glory.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,070
Megan has to be
around here somewhere.

15
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,320
Let's find her.

16
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,600
Oh...

17
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,190
(buzz)

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,490
Oh no.

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,920
Oh, Bull.

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,010
Yoo-hoo.
Up here.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,290
Hey, Mr. Bull,
bet you can't catch me.

22
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,750
Come on, Sting.
Wake up.

00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,290

(Morning Glory)
Yoo-hoo, Mr. Bull.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,630
(Morning Glory)
You missed me.

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,530
(Morning Glory)
Try again if you can.

28
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,220
What's going on here?

29
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,470
Megan,

30
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,310
it's me, Morning Glory.

31
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,440
- (Bull snorts)
- Look out.

32
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,570
Do something, quick.

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,390
Be right back.

34
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,450
Hurry.

35
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,620
We've got to get the
bull back into his stall.

36
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,220
Over here, Toro.
Come on, boy.

37
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,380
(snorts)

38
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,380
Come on, Sting.
Wake up.

39
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,250
What happened?

40
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,500
I'll tell you later.

41
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,750
Just follow me.

42
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,820
Open the stall door.

43
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,310
(snorts)

44
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,480
Okay, Toro.
Come and get it.

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,320
Got him.

46
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,990
Thanks, Megan.

47
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,850
Oh, this is Sting.

48
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,920
Nice to meet you.

49
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,570
The Flutter Ponies
need your help.

50
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,200
What's the trouble?

51
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,010
It's the witches again,
and Bumble.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,950
My ex-queen.

53
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,120
They stole the Sunstone,

54
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,290
and if we don't get it back to
Flutter Valley by sunset,

55
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,790
Flutter Valley will be no more!

56
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,790
(Megan)
We better hurry then.

57
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,840
Uh-oh.

58
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,720
I just realized
you're too big to fly on me.

59
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,290
Me too.

60
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,130
No problem.

61
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,680
You hold this side,

62
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,480
and you hold this side,
Morning Glory.

63
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,890
It's a magic carpet.

64
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,220
I'm ready if you are.

65
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,360
Check.

66
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,390
Check.

67
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,890
To Ponyland.

68
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,140
We did it!

69
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,950
(crow caws)

70
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,530
Punch, punish,
puny, purgatory...

71
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,080
Here it is.
I got it - purple.

72
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,570
Do it, Draggle.

73
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,790
Turn those
puny little ponies purple.

74
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,290
I'll try, Mama...
I mean Hydia.

75
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,420
Oh, when the furbob gets back
with help,

76
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,930
you'll be sorry, witches.

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,750
Get on with it, Draggle.

78
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,080
Make 'em purple.

79
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,980
Skirmin, forster,
mandeboo, marcus, farcus, yuck!

80
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,100
Well?

81
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,390
Oh, I left out a "yuck."

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,650
YUCK!

83
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,780
(laughs)

84
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,660
Look what you've done.

85
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,580
You nincompoop.

86
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,170
(wails)

87
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,990
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'll get it off. Here.

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,920
Wait...
It's coming.

89
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,590
Get away from me.
It's not coming off.

90
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,840
I'm still purple.

91
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,430
Me too.

92
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,840
Now we have to go all the
way back to the Volcano of Gloom

93
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,120
to get it off.

94
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,970
And if I miss the sunset,
you'll be one sorry witch.

95
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,140
I'm already sorry.

96
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,030
Come on, Hydia.

97
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,600
Let's get on purple.

98
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,400
You too, Ahhg.

99
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,060
(sobs)

100
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,560
Oh, what did I do wrong?

101
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,700
There are plenty
of other witches.

102
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,560
Why did I have
to get Draggle?

103
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,460
(crow caws)

104
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,880
Uh-oh!

105
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,130
What am I going to do?

106
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,000
I've got to get help.

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,640
I know, I'll go back to
Furbobia and get more furbobs.

108
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,160
No.

109
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,760
Oh, I can't do that.
The stonebacks are there.

110
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,970
Paradise Estate.

111
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,250
I'll go there.
I can't.

112
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,150
I don't know where it is.

113
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,260
Oh me, maybe somebody else
should have escaped.

114
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,140
What a fix.

115
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,650
Everyone's counting on me
to be a hero,

116
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,770
and I can't even make up
my mind how to be one.

117
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,110
Or if I can,
or if I even wanna be one.

118
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,030
Now what do I do?

119
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,510

It looks like a Bushwoolie.

134
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,550
Maybe he's got some word on
the Flutter Ponies.

135
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,990
Who are you?

136
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,260
I'm Morning Glory,
a Flutter Pony.

137
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,770
And this is Sting,
and Megan.

138
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,360
We thought
you were a Bushwoolie.

139
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,180
The Bushwoolies are my cousins.

140
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,500
I'm a Furbob,

141
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,940
and I have to rescue
some little ponies.

142
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,570
What a dilemma.

143
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,090
Maybe we should
rescue the ponies first.

144
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,360
No, I think we'll need the
Flutter Ponies

145
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,290
to defeat the witches.

146
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,780
Furbob is right.

147
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,340
Let's go to Bumbleland
and free the Flutter Ponies,

148
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,100
get the Sunstone
and then go to Flutter Valley.

149
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,460
Let's do it.

150
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,840
Are you sure
we're doing the right thing?

151
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,220
Yes. Come on.

152
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,680
It's about time, Pointer.

153
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,650
I'm famished.

154
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,140
(slurps)

155
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,970
Oh, so tasty.

156
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,290
Without the Sunstone,
it's back to the old ways,

157
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,450
Flowers are hard
to come by around here.

158
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,200
Not for long.

159
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,700
Bring me the Flutter Ponies!

160
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,160
(buzz)

161
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,410
What do you
want with us now, Bumble?

162
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:38,210
I want the Sunstone,
and you,

163
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:43,230
right here in Bumbleland
to keep Flutter Valley alive.

164
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,090
The Sunstone
belongs to us.

165
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,420
Yeah, you stole it!

166
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,320
No matter.

167
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,560
The Sunstone must be retrieved

168
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,510
or it will do
none of us any good.

169
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,270
Suppose we help
you dig it up.

170
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,190
Will you give it back to us?

171
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,160
(laughs)

172
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,100
Give it?
(laughs)

173
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,610
Give...
Give it back?

174
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,290
You will dig it up
because you are my prisoners.

175
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,830
Let the work begin!

176
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,700
(slurps)

177
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,210
(snoring)

178
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,130
Darn.
I thought I had it that time.

179
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,010
Make the hole bigger.

180
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,730
If we could just get the honey
off our wings we could fly.

181
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,270
Then we could do
something about this.

182
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,020
I have a better idea!

183
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,540
Be careful, Honeysuckle.

184
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,950
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

185
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,810
Er... I'm just thirsty.
It's hard work.

186
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,750
Hey!

187
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,980
Hey, what is going on here?

188
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,170
Let me down.

189
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,060
No, no don't let me down.

190
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,310
Help!

191
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,900
You're not going anywhere,
Bumble.

192
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,590
Not until we get the Sunstone
and go back to Flutter Valley.

193
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,770
You'll never get away
with this.

194
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,900
Pointer, do something.

195
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,420
I'll save you,
your Bumbleness.

196
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,910
No, Pointer.
Not that way.

197
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,740
No!

198
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,710
(screams)

199
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,000
Get the Flutter Ponies!

200
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:40,760
Oh!

201
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,210
Whoopsy...

202
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,430
Help!

203
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,350
Honeysuckle...
