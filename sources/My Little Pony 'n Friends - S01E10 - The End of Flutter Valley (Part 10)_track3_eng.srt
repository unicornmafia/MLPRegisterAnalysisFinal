Rooooaaaghhhr!

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,820
Our beloved Valley is no more,
Megan.

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,320
We'll never save it now.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,120
There's still time,
Rosedust.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,410
All we have to do is
get past Ahhg.

15
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,660
That's all?

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,870
If we would have done something

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,170
about the witches
in the first place,

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,880
this never would have happened.

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,580
We'll find a way to get the
Sunstone back in place,

20
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,830
you'll see.

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,230
(Stonebacks snorting)

22
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,510
That's it.
The Stonebacks.

23
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,930
What about the Stonebacks?

24
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,440
With their help,
we can tunnel under Ahhg,

25
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,310
and get into the valley
that way.

26
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,600
What do you say, Stonebacks?
Can you do it?

27
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,100
(snorts)

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,240
Come on! We've got to
go where he can't see us.

29
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,950
(snorts)

30
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,920
Come on, Flutter Ponies.
We can help too.

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,750
(snorts)

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,680
I don't hear the tinkle
of Utter Flutter any more.

33
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,260
(Laughs)
That's 'cause
Ahhgy's doing his job.

34
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,690
Nobody's getting into
this valley now.

35
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,780
To the setting sun, and the end
of Flutter Valley.

36
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,280
Soon it will be ours.

37
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,820
There must be something
we can do

38
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,700
to stop this from happening.

39
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,860
We've tried everything.

40
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,910
And I'm all out of surprises.

41
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,320
That's a surprise.

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,120
If only Megan were here,
she'd know what to do.

43
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,990
If only we had more help,
we could do it.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,760
Megan.
Megan, we're here.

45
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,470
- Yeah, we're here.
- We're here.

46
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,720
Hi, Megan.

47
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,670
Hello, Baby Cuddles.

48
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,140
Is there still time?

49
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,510
Just. But we
need everyone's help.

50
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,590
We can help.

51
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,240
Yeah,
we're good diggers.

52
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,100
- Real good.
- Yeah, good.

53
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,680
- So are we.
- No, we aren't.

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,900
What about the Stonebacks?

55
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,940
(snorts)

56
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,020
(blows raspberries)

57
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,240
I told them
they want to be friends,

58
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,110
but it may take a while.

59
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,750
No, right now
we all have to work together.

60
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,030
Together?

61
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,360
With Stonebacks?

62
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,180
Yes, with Stonebacks!
It's our only chance.

63
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,250
Start digging.

64
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,690
We did it, everybody!
We did it!

65
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,440
Huh? Roooooooaaaaaaghhhr!

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,870
(cheers)

67
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,130
What was that?

68
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,970
Look.

69
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,540
It's the Flutter Ponies.

70
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,590
No, Flutter Valley was
almost mine.

71
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,470
I was so close.

72
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,720
Come on!

73
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,090
No, you can't do this.
Flutter Valley's mine.

74
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,170
- Megan.
- Let us out.

75
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,820
Blast it, Flutter Ponies.

76
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,900
Gee, are we ever glad
to see you.

77
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,160
Same here,
Fizzy.

78
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,000
Come on! Let's get the Sunstone
back where it belongs.

79
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,010
(All)
Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull!

80
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,470
(All)
Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull!

81
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,010
Good work, Flutter Ponies.

82
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,130
You're getting it.
Just a little more.

83
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,300
Hurry, it's almost sunset.

84
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,270
(cheers)

85
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,800
What's that?

86
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,820
It's Bumble and her swarm.

87
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,140
Oh no!
It can't be.

88
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,390
What are we gonna do?

89
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,310
(buzz)

90
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,460
(buzz)

91
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,290
No, Bumble.
Don't do it.

92
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:59,710
Out of my way, Sting.
I want that Sunstone.

93
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,380
Look out, Sting.

94
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,580
Oof!

95
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,880
Uhh!

96
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,800
Leave the Flutter Ponies alone.

97
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,330
The Sunstone is theirs.

98
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,230
But I want it too.

99
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,970
It grows flowers with
all that delicious nectar.

100
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,490
You're fat and greedy
and selfish, Bumble.

101
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,310
You only think of yourself.

102
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,410
I am not fat.

103
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,700
If you promise to
leave us alone, Bumble,

104
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,910
you can come here
any time for the flowers.

105
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,440
Well, I...

106
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,580
That's very kind of you,
Rosedust.

107
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,080
I don't know what to say.

108
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,700
Say you're gonna be nice,

109
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,870
and maybe I'll come back
to Bumbleland.

110
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,540
I'll be nice.

111
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,920
Oh, thank you, Rosedust.

112
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,350
Oh, what a wonderful day.

113
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,040
Come on,
let's go home.

114
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,940
Goodbye, Sting,
and thank you for your help.

115
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,180
So long, everybody.
Bye bye, Morning Glory.

116
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,060
Come visit me.

117
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,730
I will.
See you.

118
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,980
Goodbye.

119
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,120
(All)
So long. Goodbye.
Thank you!

120
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,390
The Sunstone
is starting to work.

121
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,660
Just a few more minutes
of sunlight

122
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,120
and the Sunstone
will be back to normal.

123
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,620
(cheers)

124
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,660
I guess you were right,
Honeysuckle.

125
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,540
There are some bad things
in this world

126
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,410
we have to be careful of.

127
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,290
But you were right too,
Morning Glory.

128
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,420
Even bad things
can turn out good.

129
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,680
Look at Bumble.

130
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,250
Not everything is good.
Look.

131
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,800
(Stoneback snorting)

132
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,810
Oh no!
The sun is gone.

133
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,060
Without some more sunlight,
the Sunstone will fade forever

134
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,400
It's terrible!

135
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,150
<i>I didn't see that cloud before.</i>

136
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,070
It just magically appeared.

137
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,020
Maybe it will go away.

138
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,270
(cackles)

139
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,520
Oh,
it's the witches.

140
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,410
I'd know that cackle anywhere.

141
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,240
(cackles)

142
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,040
Yes.
It is us.

143
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,420
And we've come to claim
the valley for our own.

144
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,540
(cackles)

145
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,590
No sun,
no Sunstone.

146
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,090
No Sunstone,
no pretty valley.

147
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,890
In a matter of seconds,

148
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,630
it will be dark, dank
and dreary forever.

149
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,530
(cackles)

150
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,890
That's what you think, Hydia.

151
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,770
To the skies, Flutter Ponies.

152
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,160
We'll blow that cloud so
far away, they'll never find it.

153
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,650
Wish you luck,
Flutter Ponies.

154
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,030
- Yeah, good luck.
- You'll need it.

155
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,490
Shift to Utter Flutter.

156
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,420
You're doing it.
It's working.

157
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,000
(cheers)

158
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,210
Give me that.

159
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,430
Do something, Hydia.
It's moving.

160
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,550
Lerton, momminic,
scronic, blacksner!

161
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,060
The witches are winning.

162
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,930
Harder, Flutter Ponies.
Give it all you have.

163
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,450
(cheers)

164
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,500
Now get the witches.

165
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,610
