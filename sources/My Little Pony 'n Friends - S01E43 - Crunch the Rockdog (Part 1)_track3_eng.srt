(sobbing)

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,620
Why would Valentine's
friend gallop away at sunset?

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,700
(sniffling)
..huh?

17
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,920
It is illogical to begin
a long journey

18
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,160
just as the sun is setting.

19
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,410
Who cares

20
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,630
what the sun was doing

21
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,710
when he had to leave
his one true love?

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,590
Yeah, how can you ask

23
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,090
a question like that
at a time like this?

24
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,730
Time like what?

25
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,220
(groan impatiently)

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,980
(sobbing)

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,270
I fail to understand
this display of sentiment.

28
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,070
It is just a story, after all.

29
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,150
Wind Whistler, it's too bad
you weren't around

30
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,950
when the Feelings Fairy
was passing out feelings.

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,860
(laughs)

32
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,330
I do have feelings..

33
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,950
Which I think
you two just proved.

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,370
Yeah, by hurting 'em.

35
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,450
Way to go, Buttons.

36
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,710

Run! Yeah, run, run!

Ow! I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry!

It's okay!
I'm glad you're sorry.

44

Right, left! Yeah, right left!
Right left!

I have feelings..

68
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,700
I merely refrain from expressing
them at the drop of a hat.

69
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,560
Don't feel bad, Wind Whistler.

70
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,160
They didn't mean it.

71
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,370
HELP! HELP!
(panting)

72
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,240
The Rockdog from
the Purple Mountain,

73
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,460
oh, it was horrible.

74
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,660
Terrible, I tell you.

75
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,990
Turned to stone.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,890
(gasps and wheezes)

77
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,710
Made marshlands
into rocky valley!

78
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,640
Oh.. No more green,

79
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,310
and.. and- and- and- and- and-
Crunch the Rockdog

80
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:28,570
turned Bushwoolies-
turned Bushwoolies- to STONE!

81
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,510
I'm gonna give that obnoxious
Rockwhatis a piece of my mind.

82
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,910
I can't go nowhere 'til I change
into my travellin' outfit.

83
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,690
Everyone!
Please remain calm!

84
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,610
Calm? Calm?

85
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,070
Only someone with no feelings

86
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,870
could remain calm
at a time like this.

87
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,910
I meant that we need
a plan of action.

88
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,040
She's right!

89
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,170
But we better find out
what makes this Rockdog tick.

90
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,290
And for that, we'll have to talk
to the Moochick.

91
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,690
Don't you worry, lil' fella.

92
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,850
We won't let that
walking stalagmite hurt you.

93
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,100
(gasps)

94
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,390
Hello?

95
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,790
Mr. Moochick?

96
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,150
Ooh- get it, ooh- ooh,

97
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,730
no, no no no, ooh, no- no,
that way!

98
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,830
(shrieks)

99
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,740
What's going on here,
Mr. Moochick?

100
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,010
After it!

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll get it! There it is!

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,750
That is a.. a very smart stick.

103
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,320
Huh! too smart, if you ask me.

104
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,560
Doesn't know its place!

105
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,810
Aha!

106
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,520
Oh, he's scared!

107
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,770
Yes, he certainly is.

108
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,610
Aww, the poor little thing.

109
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,150
Perhaps it feels unappreciated,
or overworked?

110
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,170
Unappreciated?
Overworked?!

111
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,410
Let it have some fun.

112
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,860
- Yeah, give it a day off!
- Let's do that.

113
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,110
Well, alright!

114
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,590
It can have a day off
every time the mushrooms bloom.

115
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,960
Hah! Hm.. oh yes, yes,
that is more like it.

116
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,350
Now, what are you folks
doing here, hmmm?

117
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,790
Have you heard of
a Crunch the Rockdog?

118
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,310
He comes from somewhere in the
Purple Mountains.

119
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,600
Oh, no no no,
never heard of him.

120
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,880
But! If he's
from the Purple Mountains,

121
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,850
then you should talk
to His Elevated Eminence,

122
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,180
the Mountain King.

123
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,480
Ooh! Just head for
the Purple Mountains,

124
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,690
you can't miss it.

125
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,970
Thank you, Mr. Moochick.

126
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,540
At least, I think
it's His Elevated Eminence..

127
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,030
or is it His Royal Rockface..?

128
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,530
Hmmm..

129
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,290
This is bad, alright...

130
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,080
Purple Mountain!

131
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,210
So that's where we'll
find His Elevated Eminence, huh?

132
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,010
(rumbling noise)
What was that?

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,170
C-C-C-C-C-CRUNCH THE ROCKDOG!

134
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,390
(roars)

135
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,360
Look out! Behind you!

136
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,900
No, lil' fella! Don't do it!

137
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,160
Behind you! Behind you!

138
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,030
Behind me? Behind me?!

139
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,780
Oh, look!
(laughs)

140
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,180
Two for the price of one.

141
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,870
(yell frantically)

142
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,260
One...

143
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,850
Two...

144
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,810
(Evil laugh)

145
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,210
(gasp)

146
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,530
I can handle him.

147
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,850
Danny, don't!

148
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,350
It's just a dog.

149
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,650
(gasps)
Oh no!

150
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,770
Hey, you!

151
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,320
Yeah, you! You fossilized mutt!

152
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,280
You're a bad dog!

153
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,360
Bad! Bad dog, sit! sit!

154
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,040
(laughs)

155
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,080
Heel, heel!

156
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,290
You- you granite mongrel!

157
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,120
(continues to laugh)

158
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,750
Down boy! Lie Down... Down!

159
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,050
He's completely blown our cover.

160
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,310
At this point, I fear our

161
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,160
only recourse
is to make a run for it.

162
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,590
I think you're right.

163
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,430
(laughs)

164
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,670
What's so funny?

165
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,680
C'mon, Danny!

166
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,980
(laughs)

167
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,260
Heel! Sit!

168
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:49,280
(laughs)

169
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,110
After them!

170
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,010
Go on without me!

171
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,340
Gusty! What in tarnation
are you doin'?

172
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,710
Go on! I've got an idea!

173
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,560
We're not leaving you!

174
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,780
I'll draw them off,
and catch up at the Mountains.

175
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,150
Gusty,
I must protest.

176
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,000
Here's dust in your eye!

177
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,120
See? I'll blind 'em
with a small dust storm,

178
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:45,720
and I'm outta here!

179
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,550
Uh- oh...

180
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,720
Uh, come to think of it..

181
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,840
a little dust wouldn't have
much effect on rocks,

182
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,090
would it..?

183
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,430
Going somewhere?

184
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,850
(evil laugh)

185
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,990
Good! 'Cause I'd like you to..

186
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,190
(laughs)

187
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,150
..stick around!

188
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,120
(continues laughing)

189
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,740
Forever!
