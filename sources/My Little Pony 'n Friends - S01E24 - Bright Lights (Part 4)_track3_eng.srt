I'll just take your shadow.

00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,930
Woah..!

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,220
(thud)
Oof!

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,360
Woah!

19
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,560
That was close.

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,120
Hold on, we've got
a long way to go.

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,400
Megan, there's no point
in talking to the Grayvalians.

22
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,580
They hate me!

23
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,750
You're wrong, Knight Shade.

24
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,410
We need them to get
the Baby Ponies' shadows back.

25
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,240
Grayvalians!

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,170
Together, we can overcome
Erebus and Zeb!

27
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,010
Why should we help you,

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,920
when you stand with the very one
who stole our shadows!

29
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,470
Because our loved ones have
lost their shadows,

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,400
and we want to save them.

31
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,560
We trusted him before,
and he betrayed our trust.

32
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,570
If you don't trust me,

33
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,190
trust Megan and the Ponies!

34
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,430
They-

35
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,530
No! Go!

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,490
And leave us alone!

37
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,990
There's nothing we can do.

38
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,950
No shadows?

39
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,840
You let them get away?

40
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,700
I must have more shadows.

41
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,000
Only Knight Shade can get me
all the shadows I need

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,090
I will not fail
you again, Erebus.

43
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,120
We've got to get the
shadow satchel away from Zeb.

44
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,100
He and Erebus are gonna come
looking for us,

45
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,600
because we're the only ones
around with shadows.

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,470
So when they come,
we can be waiting for them.

47
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,440
I'll stay here with
Lickety-Split and Knight Shade

48
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,610
and try to get them
from behind, okay?

49
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,310
You and the sheriff
can circle through the woods.

50
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,150
We'd better do something,
they're here!

51
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,160
Now's our chance!

52
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,400
There they are, Zeb!

53
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,880
Return to me, Knight Shade,
and I'll forgive you!

54
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,300
You can't fool me anymore,
Erebus!

55
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,090
I'll never return,

56
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,800
And I won't let you
hurt my friends.

57
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,640
Surrender, Knight Shade.

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,230
You and your friends
can't stop us.

59
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,760
(fizzing)

60
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,650
(dismayed noises)

61
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,860
You must return to me.

62
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,320
Your friends cannot protect you.

63
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,180
Now feed me.

64
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,080
Give me that shadow now!

65
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,740
<i>Going someplace?</i>

66
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,110
Zeb's waitin' for ya.

67
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,460
(Evil laugh)

68
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,960
Leave this place, Erebus.

69
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,760
Listen to him, Zeb.

70
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,710
He's giving me orders!

71
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,800
Such rudeness,

72
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,180
and after everything
you've done for him, too.

73
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,560
You should have stuck
with me, my boy.

74
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,390
I would have made you famous,

75
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,710
and you could have
supplied me with shadows.

76
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,950
Spare him!

77
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,290
(laughs)
A mother's love!

78
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,040
How touching!
(laughs)

79
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,580
Knight Shade, you don't want
your mother to suffer, do you?

80
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,500
(Evil laugh)

81
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,000
Hey, Boss,
we got 'em!

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,670
Aww, we got the
big Cheesies, hurr hurr..

83
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,920
Seize them!

84
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,220
Oh..!

85
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,930
Mother!

86
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,180
Knight Shade, you know I'm the
only one

87
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,270
that has really had the power
to do anything for you.

88
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,900
Remember the fame?
The adoring fans?

89
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,420
It's not worth it
any more, Erebus.

90
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,690
You're a real fool.

91
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,590
Zeb! Another shadow.

92
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,830
This time, get his friend,

93
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,030
who thinks she's been hiding
from us in the bushes.

94
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,180
Knight Shade!

95
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,290
I'll just take your shadow.

96
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,130
No!

97
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,480
Go away, don't bother me.

98
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,820
You!

99
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,310
Because of you and your friends,
Knight Shade turned against me!

100
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,730
Soon you'll join him
in his torment!

101
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,380
I have a surprise
for you, Erebus.
