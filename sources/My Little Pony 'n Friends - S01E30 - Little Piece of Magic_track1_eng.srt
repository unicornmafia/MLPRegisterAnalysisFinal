What we play now?

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,590
Not play.

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,260
Time for practice to be
the famousest famous Ballerina.

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,510
(singing)
Ra...ra...ra...ra

16
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,380
Whoa! Ow!

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,550
Okay, maybe play now.

18
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,930
Okay, what game?

19
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,200
Aa...ba...

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,440
Checkers!

21
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,740
Baby Lofty, go get
checkers, okay?

22
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,980
Me try.

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,070
Whoa!

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,120
(gasps)
I'm never gonna fly good.

25
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,250
Didn't wanna play
checkers anyway.

26
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,670
Yes, checkers!

27
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,380
Aaa...

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,880
Baby Ribbon, get up, okay?

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,130
Wink up there.

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,010
Hmmm...okay.

31
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,810
Get checkers!

32
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,400
No! I'm not all here.

33
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,230
Checkers is all there.

34
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,510
I'm not all here.

35
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,900
We thought we heard a crash.

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,230
Is everybody okay?

37
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,100
What's going on?

38
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,150
Mama!

39
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,820
Where are you?

40
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,070
Some of me up here.

41
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,030
Help!

42
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,200
Thanks, Mommy.

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,250
Now hold still.

44
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,830
Some little ponies look
a little bored to me.

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,100
Buttons, would you play
a game with us?

46
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,950
Please!

47
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,100
(All) Play with us, please!

48
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,540
Why don't you play
by yourselves today?

49
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,100
How does a game of
make-believe sound?

50
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,810
(All) Ugh!

51
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,380
Make-believe is a great game.

52
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,970
You don't need anyone
else to play with you.

53
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,470
All you need is
your imagination.

54
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,110
I-Imagination?

55
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,720
(giggles)
Sure.

56
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,700
Buttons and I will
get you started.

57
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,320
But then the rest is up to you.

58
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,040
Let's go!

59
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,900
All right everyone.

60
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,280
Look at the hill.

61
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,130
Something special will be
coming over at any second.

62
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,950
Just grass there.

63
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,580
Ribbon and I'll send our very
favorite old toy over the hill.

64
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,470
Oh, it's a wonderful red ball

65
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,960
that can be anything
you want it to be.

66
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,510
(both gasp)
Anything? In the whole world?

67
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,050
Anything.
It's all up to you.

68
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,310
This gonna be fun.

69
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,180
What ball can it be?

70
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,680
Maybe...maybe...

71
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,190
(ball bouncing)

72
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,650
<i>Who are you?</i>

73
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,830
<i>Your very own special
playmate, Baby Tiddlywinks.</i>

74
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,670
<i>And I know a place filled with</i>

75
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,450
<i>the best toys and games

76
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,000
<i>Oh! Boy!</i>

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,620
<i>Just close your eyes, we'll
be there in a flash.</i>

78
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,040
<i>Wow! Look at all the toys.</i>

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,790
<i>In this place, there's nothing
to do but play all day.</i>

80
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,970
<i>What's this?</i>

81
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,930
<i>It's a ping-pong table,
made especially for you.</i>

82
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,180
<i>Get ready.</i>

83
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,110
<i>(Baby Tiddlywinks)
Wanna play more.</i>

84
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,390
<i>Okay, come on.</i>

85
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,660
<i>This is the best game ever.</i>

86
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,900
<i>Look!</i>

87
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,150
<i>(Baby Tiddlywinks)
Wow!</i>

88
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,490
<i>Looks hard.</i>

89
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,000
<i>Every room has a
different surprise.</i>

90
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,870
<i>And you have to find
your way through.</i>

91
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,750
<i>- Try it.
- Okay</i>

92
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,990
<i>I'll see you at the other end.</i>

93
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,880
<i>Oh-oho!</i>

94
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,420

<i>Which way I go?</i>

99
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,900
<i>Go...this way.</i>

100
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,410
<i>(merriment)</i>

101
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,190

103
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,950
<i>I told you, you could do it.</i>

104
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,420
<i>Baby Tiddlywinks likes ball.</i>

105
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,620
<i>Ha ha, shucks.
I'm turning red.</i>

106
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,090
(laughs)
It will be just like that.

107
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,970
Will be just like what?

108
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,710
I was just thinking what red
ball would be like to play with.

109
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,980
Oh, boy!

110
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,470
Red ball is gonna
play with me too.

111
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,350
Yes.

112
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,290
<i>What we do?</i>

113
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,860
<i>I'm gonna teach you how to be
a great flier, Baby Lofty.</i>

114
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,460
<i>Follow me.</i>

<i>Pretty!
So pretty!</i>

124
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,690
<i>I couldn't have
brought you here,</i>

125
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,180
<i>if you weren't such a
good flier already.</i>

127
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,600
<i>Sure.</i>

School of Winking.</i>

167
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,560
<i>(cheering)</i>

168
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,900
<i>It's good. Bye.</i>

169
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,040

That was fun.

177
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,670
Where ball?

178
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,520
Maybe, it wasn't any ball.

179
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,230
Maybe, it was imagination.

180
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,980
Imagination?

181
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,230
Yeah.

182
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,680

<i>(Ribbon)
Naptime everyone, naptime.</i>

200
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,300
So, did you have fun
playing by yourselves?

201
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,900
(All chuckle)
Yeah.

202
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,420
(chuckles)
I guess you did.

203
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,680
Now, it's time for your nap.

204
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,820
- Okay.
- See you later. Bye, bye. Bye.

205
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:06,310
They really enjoyed themselves.

206
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,820
What...what happened
to the red ball?

207
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,690
I didn't see it
with the baby ponies,

208
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,580
and I know
we sent it over the hill.

209
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,340
Ribbon, look!

210
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,540
