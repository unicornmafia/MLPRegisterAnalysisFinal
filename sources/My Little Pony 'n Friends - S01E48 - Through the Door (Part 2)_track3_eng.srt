I'm not half so good as you,
Robin Hood!

You'll get the hang
of it, North Star.

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,510
Watch!

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,100
(All gasp)
Ah, impossible!

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,970
I've never missed a shot. Ever!

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,230
(cries)

20
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,890
There! Clean as a whistle.

21
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,240
Just let me clean
what's underneath and--

22
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,530
(struggling)
What's happening to my strength?

23
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,320
Oh, my dear!

24
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,220
All my life,

25
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,540
my heart has yearned for
one as fair as you.

26
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,590
And you, and you, and you.

27
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,090
(All sigh)

28
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,680
My dearest, my darling.
(smacks)

29
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,420
My only, my one true love.

30
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,820
(gasps)
A wrinkle?

31
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,560
My face, my perfect face!

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,730
It's ruined!

33
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,570
(All applaud)

34
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,740
Graceful flowing,
my little Salomes.

35
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,030
<i>(growl in the distance)</i>

36
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,490
Run, my little ones!

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,170
The monster!

38
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,830
And what about the
barometric pressure?

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,760
The pollen count and--

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,880
Oh, I just wished for
a perfect day--

41
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,520
Don't be discouraged,
Lickety-Split.

42
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,710
Give it another try.

43
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,260
At this point, the only thing

44
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,880
that would cheer me up is a
nice, big, ice-cream cone,

45
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,480
and I mean a huge one!

46
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,270
Chocolate, strawberry,
vanilla, butter pecan?

47
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,810
(groans)
Here we go again...

48
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,060
(Lickety-Split clears throat)

49
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,560
Pardon me, but I believe
I can expedite matters.

50
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,780
(clears throat again)

51
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,610
Lickety-Split would like
a 200-foot sugar cone

52
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,130
filled with 200
scoops of rocky road.

53
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,780
Each scoop 2 to 4
feet in diameter

54
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,750
and the entire confection
should be covered with

55
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,620
2 tons of chocolate jimmies.

56
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,120
You got it!

57
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,170
Gee wiz!

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,330
You did it!

59
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,380
Indeed, it's exactly
what I requested.

60
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,130
Of course, you expected
something less.

61
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,580
Uh-oh! Make it go away!

62
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,150
But you just called it
"perfection!"

63
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,310
(All gasp)
Make it disappear!

64
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,470
Huh?

65
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,150
(All yelling)
Run! Run! Run!

66
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,930
W-what happened?

67
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,350
How'd ya make it disappear?

68
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,430
I didn't.

69
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,830
That ice-cream cone

70
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,400
should have lasted long
enough for you to eat it.

71
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,200
Yoo-hoo! Prince Charming?
Darling?

72
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,160
It's me,
your little Heart Throb?

73
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,330
My! They certainly are letting
this place get rundown!

74
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,000
(crumbling)

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,950
Appalling!

76
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,800
Oh Princey-poo?!

77
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,940
(gasps)
Huh?

78
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,600
What happened to the words?

79
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,880
Where are the pictures?

80
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,600
The storybooks are all blank!

81
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,150
(Paradise)
Megan! Are you there?

82
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,690
Paradise! What're
you doing here?

83
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,290
I wanted to ask you about some
new legends I've just met.

84
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,450
Robin Hood, Chaharazad,
Paul Bunyan.

85
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,700
You met them?

86
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,570
They're only legends in books.

87
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,070
Only-- all the pages in
my books are blank.

88
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,750
Well, they all left the Land of
Legends today

89
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,040
and came to Ponyland.

90
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's go to Paradise Estate.

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,590
Something weird's
going on here...

92
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,830
and there!

93
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,600
You're Robin Hood, all right.
The great archer.

94
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,590
I seem to have lost my touch.

95
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,390
Really?

96
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,510
<i>(Chaharazad) Run! Everybody
run for your lives!</i>

97
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,760
<i>(Paul Bunyan) It's coming!</i>

98
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,930
(Megan)
What is?

99
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,150
The monster!

100
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,430
<i>(stomps approaching)
(angry growl and roar)</i>

101
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,160
(All gasp)

102
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,820
I'ma comin' to get you!

103
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
(Megan)
It doesn't look so dangerous.

104
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,690
Come on!

105
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,200
Hey!

106
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,170
No fair hiding!

107
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,530
We're doomed!

108
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,420
(chuckles)
I found you!

109
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,670
(Lickety-Split)
Monster!

110
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,920
Huh?

111
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,000
Stop it!
Bad monster! Down!

112
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,220
(groaning)
Aww...

113
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,670
Bad monster!

114
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,550
You play too rough.

115
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,970
(crying)
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,610
This is what you
were so afraid of?

117
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,690
Where have you been?

118
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,190
I haven't had anyone to chase.

119
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,720
I get it!

120
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,320
It can't help
being the monster

121
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,230
anymore than Prince Charming
can help being charming

122
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,730
or Paul Bunyan can keep
from chopping down trees.

123
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,910
See! You all have different
roles in the Land of Legends.

124
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,800
And the monster's role is...

125
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,370
well, to be a monster.

126
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,750
I don't know about that.

127
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,330
<i>(Heart Throb)
Yoo-hoo! Prince Charming!</i>

128
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,010
Princey! My love!

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,970
I thought I'd never
see you again.

130
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:50,010
Unfortunately, you're not nearly
as charming as I remembered.

131
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,420
(sighs)
It's true.

132
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,770
I'm losing my looks.

133
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,650
And I can't swing my
axe to save my life.

134
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,400
And my aim is gone.

135
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,730
Well!
Maybe it's time you considered

136
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,610
going back where you belong?

137
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,750
But we want to stay.

138
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,020
I can't say I blame them.

139
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,250
That place is simply
falling apart!

140
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,290
Falling apart?

141
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,860
The Land of Legends?

142
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,920
Let's help them if we can.

143
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,250
(Heart Throb)
The land beyond the door

144
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,180
(tremoring)
is falling apart!

145
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,770
I think it's because they
left the Land of Legends.

146
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,010
I bet if you all
went back through door,

147
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,270
everything would get better.

148
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,020
Very well, we'll go back.

149
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,520
But not with that thing!

150
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,020
(All)
He's right! He's right!
I don't want to go with him.

151
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,200
But has he ever really hurt you?

152
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,150
Well, no.

153
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,710
But he's made our
lives miserable.

154
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,820
But I only do what I have to do!

155
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,290
I always lose, so you can win.

156
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,660
You are heroes and I'm
always the bad guy.

(All gasp)

179
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,030
Why don't you take him with you?

180
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,710
- I don't know...
- What do you think?

181
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,250
(sobs)

182
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,990
May hap,
we were wrong about you.

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,140
We're sorry.

184
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:30,970
(sobs loudly)

(All)
-Goodbye! -Farewell! -Farewell!

187
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,940
Goodbye!

188
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,650
(Ponies)
So long! Bye!

189
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,850
Goodbye, Robin.

190
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,560
I shall miss you.

191
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,080
I don't suppose we'll
ever meet again!

192
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,070
You'll see us all
sooner than you think.

193
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,570
We'll always be around.

194
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,450
Tally ho!

195
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,910
(door creaks and slams)

196
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,770
Well, I guess everything
will be back to normal soon.

197
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,180
Righto, everything will be
just ducky...

198
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,880
You miss him too, don't you?

199
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,770
Yes I--
Huh?

200
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,730
Oh! Look!

201
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,600
Megan left her books behind.

202
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,940
And the stories are back!

203
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,460
(gasps)
"The Adventures of Robin Hood."

204
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,700
Lofty, it's him!

205
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,370
And look! "Chaharazad's
Thousand-and-One Nights."

206
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,380
"Once upon a time, there was a
princess named Chaharazad. "

207
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,830
Robin Hood was right.

208
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,380
They will be around forever.
