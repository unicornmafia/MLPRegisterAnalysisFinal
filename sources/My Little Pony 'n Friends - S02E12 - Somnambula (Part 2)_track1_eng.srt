That's where
the Little Ponies are, Tex.

That's where Buttons is!

Then that's
where we're gonna go.

Now, you lil' 'uns head back
up to the hills and stay safe.

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,050
Come on!
Let's see some teamwork.

16
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,860
Whoa!

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,110
Now that's what I call teamwork.

18
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,070
Boy howdy!

19
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,290
I'm beginnin' to understand

20
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,880
why all the Little Ponies
left home.

21
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,070
Maybe.

22
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,910
But there's something
weird about all this.

23
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,210
Truly!

24
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,160
Hey, c'mere,
we wanna talk to ya.

25
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,930
Well how do you like that?

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,250
Lickety-Split?

27
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:35,900
It's us.

28
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,840
It's the Big Brother Ponies.

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,760
Not now, I've gotta
get some more ice cream.

30
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,520
(Arabian music)

31
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,520
Heart Throb!

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,150
No!

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,030
I am Salome,

34
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,120
one of the most famous lovers
in history.

35
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,360
Heart Throb,
don't you recognize us?

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,610
Go away,

37
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,210
you're spoiling my performance.

38
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,580
No!

39
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,960
You're gonna listen to us.

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,130
Heart Throb...you're so old.

41
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,380
I feel fine.

42
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,630
Now get out of here!

43
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,140
I want to be alone.

44
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,140
Gingerbread!

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,100
(All gasp)

46
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,780
I just gotta find Buttons
I gotta know if she's okay.

47
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,620
That gal's face looked like
40 miles of bad road.

48
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,730
Something is not
altogether ship-shape here.

49
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,980
I'll say!

50
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,580
We've got to get them
outta here now.

51
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,790
And we can't let
anything stop us.

52
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,620
(All)
Wooaaaah!

53
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,330
Well shift my gears!

54
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,430
Boy, what a spread!

55
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,140
(All gasp)

56
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,020
Ho-ho-ho!
Blow me down!

57
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,570
Now who coulda' known
that football is my game?

58
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,350
Aye, and there's the
fine ship I've always wanted.

59
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,610
Wait a minute, guys.

60
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,830
This isn't right.

61
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,700
It's too perfect.

No, don't make me do it
Somnambula.

88
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,980
What you're doing is evil.

I have my new powers.

I've got to get out

I've just got to.

105
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,800
Gotta get out.
Gotta get out.

106
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,560
Oh, I am out.

107
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:47,890

108
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
Hey, look!

109
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,520
- Hey!
- Over here.

110
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,510
(All)
There she is! Look!
Yeah, I see her!

111
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,740
What do you want?

112
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,580
Have you seen the ponies?

113
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,570
They're in there,
and they're all playing.

114
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,690
What?

115
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,910
Somnambula made me
sing them into a trance.

116
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,910
Who's Somnambula?

117
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,190
She's an awful witch,

118
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,420
who takes the youth for herself
and only gives back age.

119
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,680
Y-you put them in a trance?

120
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,530
Can you put them out of it?

121
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,380
Well, I suppose I could sing a
different song,

122
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,260
but I'm not going back there.

123
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,380
I'm not going anywhere
near Somnambula again.

124
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,710
But you have to help us.

125
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,960
Please!

126
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,890
Help rescue our friends.

127
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,770
(All)
Yeah, help us! Please!

128
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,930
Okay...I'll help.

129
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,150
Will you come with me?

130
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,440
(All)
YES!

131
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,060
Okay, no one's around.

132
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,940
Cover your ears.

133
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,910

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,250
You came!
You rescued us.

138
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,310
Our heroes.

139
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,420
But what's happened to us?

140
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,920
We're so old.

141
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Where's Buttons?

142
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,890
I can't find her.

143
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,060
Yeah! I haven't
seen any of the unicorns.

144
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,940
And you won't, either.

145
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,690
4-Speed, Slugger,
come with me.

146
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,940
The rest of you -
protect the Little Ponies.

147
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,570
And bring that bird.

148
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,280
You heard him.

149
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,950
Let's get down to business.

150
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,200
Yee-Haw!

151
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,580
Let's break it down.

152
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,790
Aaaagh!

153
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,290
Let's try again.

154
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,630
Now you'll know what it's like
to have someone gnawin' on you.

155
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,720
Hey, watch where you're goin'!

156
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,150
This is gettin' us nowhere.

157
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,030
We've got to get it open.

158
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,190
Remember Slugger -

159
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,210
Buttons is probably
on the other side.

160
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,250
It's like
all their magic powers

161
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,740
are being sucked
into that crystal.

162
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,320
So...that's it.

163
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,090
Somnambula's been getting
her youth from the other ponies,

164
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,960
and her new powers
from the unicorns.

165
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,840
Quite right, Kyrie!

166
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,630
And I've no intention
of giving them up.

167
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,340
Woo-Wee!

168
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,090
Sing, Kyrie
- wake the unicorns up.

169
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,190
But she can't.

170
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,150
(muffled squeaks)

171
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,020
Then, I'll stop you myself.

172
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,650
Ah...but you won't.

173
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,320
(laughs)

174
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,580
Buttons!

175
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,040
(gasps)
No!

176
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,620
NO!

177
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,340
No...!

178
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,810
No, no!

179
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,030
Well, tie me up
and brand me.

180
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,280
Ya all's young again!

181
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,650
And everybody's safe
and sound.

182
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,790
What about Slugger?

183
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,890
And Buttons?

184
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,620
Don't worry.

185
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,160
They're the safest
and soundest of any of us.

186
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,650
(All giggle)

187
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,880
Let's hard a port and
set sail for safe dry dock.

188
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,640
I've got a better idea, Salty.
Let's go home instead?
