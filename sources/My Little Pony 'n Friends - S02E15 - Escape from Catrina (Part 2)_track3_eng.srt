We're coming!

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,910
And I've got the rainbow.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,530
(gusts of wind)

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,460
Okay, rainbow,

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,800
do your stuff.

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,710
It's working.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,810
The sun is coming out.

17
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,270
It's melting the snow.

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,610
Be careful, rainbow.

19
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,310
Look out!

20
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,560
The rainbow saved us.

21
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,740
It protected us, again.

22
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,630
Good work, rainbow.

23
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,900
I guess we'll have to
find some other slaves.

24
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,050
Nope, I want
those little ponies.

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,580
But how do we get past
the rainbow?

26
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,210
We'll get the rainbow first,

27
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,750
then the little ponies.

28
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,000
Dream Castle's so beautiful.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,890
All that's left to do
is hang these balloons.

30
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,590
I'll help!

31
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,260
No thanks, Sundance.

32
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,140
You've done enough already.

33
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,390
Oh...

34
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,650
What'd she do wrong?

35
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,270
Everything!

36
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,780
Sundance is a very good jumper.

37
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,320
It's landing she's not so
good at.

38
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,690
(sobs)

39
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,520
Don't cry, Sundance.

40
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,950
Everyone goes through
a clumsy stage.

41
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,870
Even I did.

42
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,790
I've always been clumsy.

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,700
But you're a great jumper,
right?

44
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,790
I can jump farther
than any other little pony.

45
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,950
Well, that's wonderful.

46
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,550
Think of all the things
you can do that others can't.

47
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,130
Now if I wanted that
big juicy apple...

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,930
I can't reach it.

49
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,180
I can.

50
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,310
See... Great jump.

51
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,300
And you didn't crash
or anything.

52
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,700
Maybe I was just lucky.

53
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,190
You're not lucky,
you're special.

54
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,310
Gee... maybe you're right.

55
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,490
Maybe? Come on.

56
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,400
I can also get to the party
faster than you can.

57
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,050
Wanna ride?

58
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,540
Sure.

59
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,680
My turn. Let me look.

60
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,220
You just looked,
it's my turn now.

61
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,100
No, I wanna see.

62
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,340
Come on, Baby Ponies.

63
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,570
Time for the party.

64
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,390
(All)
Yay! Yippee!

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,110
(All)
Party time! Let's go!

66
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,680
Baby Moondancer,
where's your costume?

67
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,940
Don't have one.

68
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,830
Don't have anything to wear.

69
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,990
Well, let's see what we can
do about that.

70
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,700
There, you can go as a princess.

71
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,950
Need a gown.

72
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,370
A gown... Let's see.

73
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,010
How's that?

74
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,800
Pretty!

75
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,600
One more thing.

76
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,310
Gee, the Rainbow Locket!

77
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,180
Perfect.

78
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,700
(gasp)
Thank you, Megan.

79
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,940
Now go to the party.

80
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,560
I'll be there as soon as
I put on my costume.

81
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,310
(morphing sound)

82
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,900
(disguised pony)
Hello there, Princess.

83
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,150
Who are you?

84
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,070
I'm going to
the costume ball too.

85
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,960
My, what a pretty locket!

86
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,830
- Can I see it?
- Why?

87
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,630
Uhh... I-I'm a nurse

88
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,500
I have to examine it.

89
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,580
No...

90
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,800
Give me that locket.

91
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,430
No!

93
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,140

95
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,180

96
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,740
I'll take that locket.

97
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,030
Help!

98
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,740
(Yells in pain)

99
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,110
I'll take the locket... and you.

100
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,910
Help!

101
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,330
Give us a ride, Rep.

102
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,960
Help! Help!

103
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,250
Baby Moondancer.

104
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,600
Take off!

105
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,040
You're too heavy.

106
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,210
Hurry.

107
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,770
Help, Megan! Help me!

108
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,020
Help!

109
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,150
Where are they?

110
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,280
What if we can't find them?

111
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,530
They'd better not hurt
Baby Moondancer!

112
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,650
(laugh)

113
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,150
Who are you?

114
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,120
We're Bushwoolies.

115
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,370
What do you think?
How do we look? Do you like us?

116
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,840
I think they're cute.

117
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,630
(Bushwoolies)
Yeah! She likes us!
Yeah! We're cute!

118
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,500
Simmer down, Bushwoolies.

119
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,250
You aren't looking for a large
cat by any chance, are you?

120
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,060
Yes, we are.

121
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,180
And a funny looking creature who
can change into other things.

122
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,850
Catrina and Rep! They
went down that hole over there.

123
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,520
Yeah, down that hole! Yeah!

124
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,770
What's down there?

125
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,330
That used to be our home, 'till
Catrina made us her slaves.

126
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,820
We've got to get down
there and save Baby Moondancer.

127
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,370
And the Rainbow of Light.

128
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,610
Follow me.

129
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,330
Whoah!

130
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,790
Oh no!

131
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,260
I want you to be my slaves.

132
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,460
No!

133
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,460
If I spare the rainbow,
will you be my slaves?

134
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,550
No!

135
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,520
Then say goodbye to
Baby Moondancer.

136
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,380
Catrina, wait.

137
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,810
That's going too far.

138
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,140
Raaaaaaaaahhhh!

139
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,530
You asked for it, Catrina.

140
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,830
Agh!

141
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,990
Aaaaahhhhh!

142
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,290
Whoa...whoa!

143
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,870
I did it, Megan!

144
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,220
You sure did, Sundance.

145
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,380
Agh!

146
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,170
Help, Rep.
Help me!

147
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,880
I-I don't know, Catrina.

148
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,480
If only you could change
and be good again.

149
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,640
I can change.
I can be really good.

150
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,510
How do we know?

151
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,840
I-I'll prove it.

152
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,190
Just help me!

153
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,900
Okay... Okay,

154
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,100
if you destroy
the witch weed machine.

155
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,900
But that took forever to build.

156
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,750
Can't you think of
something else?

157
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,270
Wait, I'll do it.

158
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,170
But I need some more potion.

159
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,410
I'm... I'm out of power.

160
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,550
Here it comes, Catrina!

161
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,800
The machine, Catrina!

162
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,010
Remember what you said.

163
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,300
(cheers)

164
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,600
Would you please
help me out now?
