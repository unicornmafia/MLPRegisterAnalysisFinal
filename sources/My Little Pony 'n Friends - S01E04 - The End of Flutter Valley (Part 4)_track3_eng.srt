Ooh, don't-don't you think
that's enough, Bumble?

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,570
You don't want to
drown them?

12
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,820
I don't.

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,790
Oh well, of course I don't.

14
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,330
I just want
to <i>GROUND them.</i>

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,650
(laughs)

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,880
That's enough.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,000
How about if I get
you some more nectar,

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,890
your...your...your...
Bumbleness?

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,840
Ugh, I'm afraid we're stuck,
Flutter Ponies.

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,340
I can hardly move.

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,930
I can!

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,810
Oh, I'm trying, Honeysuckle.

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,570
There's a tiny opening...If...
if I can only get up there,

24
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,440
maybe I can escape.

25
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,650
You can do it, Morning Glory.

26
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,480
Just a little more.

27
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,280
One more step to freedom.

28
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,900
(cheers)

29
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,370
Hey, you can't do that!

30
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,200
Oh no!

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,410
Buzz...ooh!

32
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,050
Hey, Stonebacks!

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,340
(giggles)
Up here.

34
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,960
Bet you can't catch me.
Na na na na na...

35
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,470
(snorts)

36
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,590
It's not working, Surprise.

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,720
I'd make a bubble,
but what good would it do?

38
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,230
What's Gusty doing?

39
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,900
Trying to blow them away.

40
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,570
It's not working.

41
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,980
Oh, they're too, too heavy.
I...I can't do it.

42
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,620
Wish them away, Wishful.

43
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,080
Oh, I wish I could.

44
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,530
- Try it, yeah.
- At least try.

45
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,750
I wish...I wish
the Stonebacks would go away.

46
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,130
(snorts)

47
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,410
Some wish.

48
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,840
Yeah,
we could do that.

49
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,890
Get ready to run.
I have an idea.

50
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,510
Run, everyone!

51
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,600
(grunt)

52
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,830
In here, Furbobs.
Hurry!

53
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,530
I knew we lived this way.

54
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,750
(snorts)

55
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,370
Welcome to Furbobia!

56
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,960
Ooh, it's beautiful!

57
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,180
And these are
the rest of the Furbobs...

58
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,380
- Hi!
- Hello!

59
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,680
- Goodbye.
- Glad to see you.

60
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,550
- No, we're not.
- What's up?

61
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,520
We need your help.
Baby Cuddles hurt her leg.

62
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,770
Prepare the steamer!

63
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,940
The steamer?

64
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,060
Me not want to get steamed.

65
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,020
(gasps)

66
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,140
I...I'm getting tired.

67
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,470
My wings are heavy
from the honey.

68
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,980
I'll never make it
to the little ponies.

69
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,870
I don't suhelp? you could

70
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,540
Well,
thanks anyway.

71
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,050
Flutter Pony!
Get her!

72
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,550
Oh dear!

73
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,140
Oh... Oh no!
My wings won't work.

74
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,640
Oh... It's hard to be a hero...

75
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,560
Back to Bumbleland!

76
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,070
No! Help!

77
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,280
Ugh,

78
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,030
I drank so much nectar,
I'm going to explode.

79
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,040
I told you to take it easy,
your Bumbleness.

80
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,490
Too much of a good thing
makes it bad.

81
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,960
Spare me the wisdom of your
philosophy, Sting,

82
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,460
and remove my slippers.

83
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,510
Ahh...that's better.

84
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,800
The escapee.

85
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,690
Well done, Pointer.
You may go now.

86
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,730
And just where did you think
you were going? Hmm?

87
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,050
Please don't hurt me.
I won't try to escape again.

88
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,120
I don't think you will either.

89
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,360
Sting,

90
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,110
place this sticky little
Flutter Pony in the cage.

91
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,990
And this time,

92
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,870
<i>YOU guard her!</i>

93
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,830
Oh, do I have to...

94
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,070
Do you wish to continue
being my right hand bee?

95
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,130
Well, to tell you the truth...

96
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,380
Just do it!

97
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,560
Oh, let's go. Let's go!
It's just you and me now.

98
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,160
Move it out!

99
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,930
Ooh!

100
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,140
Is it getting warm in here,
or is it just me?

101
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,390
(yawns)

102
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,600
I'm so sleepy...

103
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,270
(snores)

104
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,270
I scared, Spike.

105
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,770
Aww, don't worry.
I'm here.

106
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,910
I won't let anything
bad happen to you.

107
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,290
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

108
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,580
As sure as I'm a Furbob.

109
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,830
We do it all the time.

110
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,590
Besides, they are our cousins.
They wouldn't do anything bad.

111
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,680
No, never, uhuh.

112
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,850
Nothing bad.

113
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,620
Baby Cuddles will be
as good as new.

114
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,880
What's that?

115
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,350
Shh...

129
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,280
Thanks for your help, Furbobs.

130
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,510
But I'm afraid we have to
leave now

131
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,470
and get back
to Paradise Estate.

132
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,920
Before you go,

133
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,520
do you think you could
help us with the Stonebacks?

134
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,440
Yeah, they destroy
every place we live.

135
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,360
They haven't found this one.

136
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,730
They will.

137
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,550
You helped us, Furbobs,

138
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,780
so we'll help you.

139
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,030
Let's get them!

140
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,280
Wait, Gusty!
There are too many Stonebacks.

141
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,490
Why don't we ask
the Flutter Ponies

142
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,360
to help us help the Furbobs?

143
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,160
Because we can do
it ourselves, that's why.

144
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,030
Fizzy's right.

145
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,660
We'll go back to Flutter
and get the Flutter Ponies.

146
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,630
It's too dangerous alone.

147
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,080
Hi.

148
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,310
Spike?

149
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,510
I thought you were staying
behind with the others.

150
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,180
Us dragons are brave and tough.

151
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,680
I thought you might need me.

152
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,520
Aaaah, what was that!

153
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,770
Oof!

154
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,240
(laughs)

155
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,190
What happened
to brave and tough?

156
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,330
Well, I'm pretty sure
we're tough.

157
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,360
Come on!

158
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,950
The way out of the orchard's
this way. I think...

159
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,090
(snorts)

160
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,580
Soon, my little girls,

161
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,710
Flutter Valley will be
wilted and ugly,

162
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,180
and we'll have a
new place to live.

163
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,210
(cackles)

164
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,880
Ow!

165
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,310
I'm not so sure I want to
the Volcano of Gloom, Hydia.

166
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,810
Me either.

167
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,950
It's hard to start over
in a new neighborhood.

168
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,190
You'll do
what I tell you to do!

169
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,980
Besides,

170
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,370
I've always wanted an
ugly old place in the country.

171
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,130
Some acreage,
a dried up stream...

172
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,290
The perfect setting to
raise a family.

173
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,570
I'm going to win, girls!

174
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,470
(Laughs)

175
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,800
It's my turn.

176
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,660
My turn.

177
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,560
Oh, I won, I won!

178
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,590
Rooaaaaggghhhr!

179
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,430
How much longer till
Flutter Valley turns rotten?

180
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,930
Just as soon as the sun sets.

181
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,940
Then it's goodbye sun,
goodbye Flutter Valley!
