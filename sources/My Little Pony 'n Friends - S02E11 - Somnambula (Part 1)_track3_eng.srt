Yay!

Gee, what if the Big Brothers
don't make it on time?

36
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,080
Who knows what might
have happened to them?

37
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,300
And a year's an
awfully long time.

38
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,090
You're speaking of
the Big Brothers.

39
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,090
They'll be here alright.

40
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,680
And they'll be on time.

41
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,690
(giggling)
Surprise!

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,100
(balloons burst)

43
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,470
Hiya Buttons!

44
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,970
Wasn't that a good surprise?

45
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,440
Uh, sure!

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,280
Now help me replace
all these surprised balloons.

47
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,820
(distant music)

48
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,160
Do you hear something?

49
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,240
(circus music playing far)

50
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,670
A bit louder, perhaps?

51
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,300
It sounds like a circus.

52
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,560
Now, Kyrie sing.

53
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,480
No, Somnambula,
please, don't make me.

54
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,140
Sing!

55
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,100
(singing)

56
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:19,370
<i>(singing continues)
Let's see... What it is...</i>

57
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,770
<i>(singing continues)
Paradise!</i>

58
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,170
<i>(singing continues)
What are you doing?</i>

59
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,110
<i>(singing continues)
You- aaoh!</i>

60
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,660
<i>(singing continues)
But the party.</i>

61
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,880
<i>(singing continues)
Oh well, It doesn't matter.</i>

62
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,080
<i>(singing continues)
Lofty,</i>

63
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,300
<i>(singing continues)
You can't! The Party!</i>

64
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,260
<i>(singing continues)
Everybody, please don't do this!</i>

65
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,840
(band plays)

66
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,190
<i>(Kyrie sings)
We're gonna play this</i>

67
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,470
<i>(singing continues)
when the big brothers cross
the finish line</i>

68
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,180
<i>(singing continues)
So get it right!</i>

69
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,810
<i>(singing continues)
You hear somethin'?</i>

70
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,400
<i>(singing continues)
I surely do.</i>

71
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,220
<i>(singing continues)
I hear the sound of
ya all not playin'!</i>

72
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:01,070
(band plays)

73
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,980
<i>(Kyrie continues to sing)</i>

74
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,380
That's enough, Kyrie.

75
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:14,000
Aaahhh...
I feel better already.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,890
Welcome.

77
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,710
We thought
we heard...a circus.

78
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,060
And so you did.

79
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,060
We can go there if you like.

80
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,740
All you have to do is follow me.

81
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,070
(All laugh)

82
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,420
(laugh Continues)

83
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,410
Fourth down and five yards
to go, Steamer.

84
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,290
We're almost home.

85
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,760
Yeah! And I'm gonna ride
all over your rails

86
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,630
at the finish line, Score!

87
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,420
Ah, just think, Salty.

88
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,600
In a few moments,
we'll see Paradise Estate again.

89
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,100
Ah, after all this time..

90
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,970
(laughs)
Aye, matey.

91
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,280
We'll hoist our jib
and lay ha-hard into port.

92
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,470
Uh... right.

93
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,470
Reckon you're lookin' forward to
seein' them

94
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,620
(laughs)
little fillies when we get home,
eh Slugger?

95
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,190
Yep.

96
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,490
'Specially that there Buttons,
huh?

97
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,280
Yep...

98
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,570
Hm.. sure hope she can improve
your talkin' abilities some.

99
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,620
Yee-haw!

100
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,220
Gonna bust
your chops, Score.

101
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,580
It ain't a touchdown
till you pass the goalpost, Tex.

102
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,100
Uh...
Ho-ho-ho! Blow me down.

103
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,920
Where is everybody?

104
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,900
Maybe they forgot
we was comin'?

105
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,760
Ah, not the Little Ponies.

106
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,180
N-not Buttons!

107
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,150
They'd never forget.

108
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,900
I've got it!

109
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,150
This is all a gag.

110
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,520
All we gotta do is walk
through that door,

111
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,740
and they'll all
jump out yelling "Surprise!"

112
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,940
It's the big brothers ya all.

113
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,110
Uhh... You could jump out
and surprise us now.

114
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,990
Anybody home?

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,260
Ahoy?

116
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,330
There is something
seriously wrong here.

117
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,710
Who could imagine
we'd return

118
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,720
after all this time to find
Paradise Estate abandoned?

119
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,920
Devoid of life?

120
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:25,600
Silent.

121
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,100
(Truly)
<i>You're here!</i>

122
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,390
You're here.

123
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,350
- Hooray!
- Me happy.

124
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,550
What happened to everybody?

125
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,220
They heard
the sound of a circus.

126
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,440
And they all
just up and left.

127
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,890
Like they were in some kind
of trance or something.

128
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,030
I hear it,
but it didn't bother me.

129
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,530
Me heard it too,
but no make me go.

130
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,070
Hm...it sounds like it affects
just the Little Ponies,

131
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,950
and not the babies.

132
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,490
And not baby dragons.

133
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,540
What d'you think
we should do?

134
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,160
I think Truly and the others
should wait here.

135
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,460
While we go find 'em!

136
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,130
They're just so dashing.

137
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,170
And brave.

138
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,090
Oh, I do hope
they can rescue the others..

139
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,640
(evil laugh)

140
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,340
Ah...I can feel
my powers increasing already.

141
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,910
Now I can make all this <i>real.</i>

142
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,320
(gasps)

143
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,850
<i>Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes,
here it is!</i>

144
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,030
<i>The wonder kitchen
bake to your heart's content.</i>

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,170
<i>Step right up, folks.</i>

146
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,080
<i>The gardener's delight!</i>

147
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,530
Oh boy, seeds!

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,670
(seeds scattering)

149
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,010
<i>Ice cream, ladies and gents.</i>

150
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,870
<i>All you can eat.</i>

151
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,090
I'll have one of each.

152
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,890
We've been following
the Ponies' tracks all day

153
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,110
without a sign of 'em!

154
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,680
And it's getting dark.

155
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,280
We're gonna
have to bed down soon.

156
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,020
N-no! We keep searching.

157
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,230
No way, Slugger!

158
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,700
Why, in five minutes,

159
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,290
you won't be able to see
your own nose.

160
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,870
(laughs)

161
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,120
Now, Kyrie.

162
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,040
Sing for me.

163
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,950
No, Somnambula.

164
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,920
It's not right.

165
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,740
I have the power to make
my illusions real now.

166
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,080
Uh- ah- all right, all right.

167
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,470
(sings)

168
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,320
<i>(singing continues)</i>

169
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,020
<i>(singing continues)
Truly!</i>

170
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,690
<i>(singing continues)
Come on! We've gotta stop her!</i>

171
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,950
<i>Hurry!
Oh, Truly, wake up!</i>

172
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,700
<i>(singing continues)</i>

173
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,340
<i>(singing continues)</i>

174
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,010
<i>(singing continues)
Oh no!</i>

175
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,590
<i>(singing continues)
Not big brothers, too?!</i>

176
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,300
<i>(singing continues)
We gotta break their trance,
somehow.</i>

177
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,180
Oh, I hate to do this,

178
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,700
but...let'em have it!

179
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,060
<i>(Kyrie continues singing)</i>

180
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,540
What in the Sam Hill?

181
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,400
What're we doing here?

182
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,870
Somebody knocked us
off the tracks.

183
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,540
<i>(Kyrie continues singing)
It was us.</i>

184
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,410
Oh! Wha-what's that singin'?

185
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,410
It's funny singing.

186
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,250
It makes all the grown-up ponies
act strange.

187
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,250
Even Big Brothers,
like they walking in sleep.

188
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,000
<i>(Kyrie continues singing)
But where is it coming from?</i>

189
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,250
Right there!

190
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,640
Slugger!

191
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,670
What're you doing?

192
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,170
Truly!

193
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,490
<i>(Kyrie continues singing)
Ahh...oh, no!</i>

194
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,260
Come back!

195
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,660
Hey, you okay good buddy?

196
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,680
<i>(Kyrie continues singing)
Yup, I-I think so...</i>

197
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,530
<i>(Kyrie continues singing)
That's where we've gotta go.</i>
