time to eat.

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,520
Come on, we take
newborn twins for walk.

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,800
Walk, where?

43
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,220
The Satin Slipper Sweet Shoppe.

44
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,390
That keep them quiet.

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,980
Scoops...
Fudge sundaes, all around.

46
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,080
I am sorry, Baby Lickety-Split,

47
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,570
we're out of ice cream.

48
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,090
- Ah! It unheard of.
- That impossible!

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,670
It terrible!

50
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,840
(All crying)

51
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,680
Rocky Ripple has shut down
the Mixville Ice Cream Works

52
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,090
to drive Fudgy McSwain
out of business.

53
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,840
Fudgy who?

54
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,680
Fudgy McSwain. He runs
the Creamy Confection Foundry.

55
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,810
He makes all the ice cream
toppings in Ponyland.

56
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,660
They really hate each other.

57
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,400
And the saddest thing is they
used to be such good friends.

58
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,750
Then there only
one thing to do.

59
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,910
We gonna make those two
friends again.

60
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,110
Come on.

61
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,790
There it is,
Mixville Ice Cream Works.

62
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,210
Is the Rocky Ripple guy
gonna even listen to us?

63
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,630
You kidding, Baby Tic-Tac-Toe?

64
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,100
Bunch of cute kids like us?

65
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,630
He do anything we ask.

66
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,130
Never!

67
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,010
Fudgy McSwain's a thief.

68
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,850
I've spent years...

69
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,550
Oops! Wrong way.

70
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,620
I spent years developing
my greatest ice cream flavor

71
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,480
double banana, marshmallow,
colada...

72
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,950
And on the day
I'm ready to start

73
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,900
making my greatest creation,

74
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,650
the piece of paper
with the recipe disappears...

75
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,290
and Fudgy McSwain took it.

76
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,290
Hmm...

77
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,870
This be tougher than I thought.

78
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,990
The Creamy Confection Foundry.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,510
Fudgy McSwain listen to us.

80
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,380
What? No!

81
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,890
Why should I crawl to him?

82
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,760
It's me that's owed the apology.

83
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,850
But Rocky Ripple just confused
'bout you that's all.

84
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,100
(both twins crying)

85
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,440
And our newborn twins
want their treat.

86
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,660
All right, then.

87
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,600
I'll speak to my old friend

88
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,750
and set things straight
for you ponies.

89
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,360
So you see, Rocky. I could
never have taken the recipe.

90
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,860
Without your ice cream,
I'd be out of business.

91
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,460
And I'd be willing
to help you look for it.

92
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,250
Old friend.

93
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,620
Old friend.

94
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,090
(All cheer)
Yay!

95
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,890
So...you pretend
to be my friend,

96
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,030
so you can abuse me in this way?

97
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,560
Now see here.

98
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,730
See how you like it

99
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,530
when you're up to your eyeballs
in butterscotch topping!

100
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,880
We better get out of here before
we make any more trouble.

101
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,620
Fudgy, wait! S'il vous plait,
if you please?

102
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,390
Insult me, will he?

103
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,130
I'll teach him a lesson
he'll nay soon forget.

104
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,230
Fudgy, please,
this is not right.

105
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,670
(babies cooing)

106
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,260
(Ponies plea together)

107
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,190
Oh, no!

108
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,330
(All Ponies gasp)

109
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,520
(All giggling)

110
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,360
- Quack, quack...
- Goodbye.

111
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,530
(babies squeal in delight)

112
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,760
Me know this must be fun full,
but...

113
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,510
I'll drown him
in chocolate syrup.

114
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,630
I'll destroy him
with chopped nuts.

115
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,770
We better warn, Rocky.

116
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,050
Rocky Ripple, you're finished!

117
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,640
Fudgy McSwain, use this.

118
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,040
It's no good.

119
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,610
Ice cream's 'sposed to
make people happy!

120
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,070
I've not yet begun to fight.

121
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,460
Why, you!

122
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,980
Ya quick frozen faker...
I'll plow you under!

123
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,840
Ooh-la-la!
We must stop this!

124
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,190
We gotta get newborn twins
some place safe.

125
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,900
Come on, we take 'em
to Satin Slipper Sweet Shoppe.

126
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,820
Why Satin Slipper?

127
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,940
No ice cream there.

128
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,700
(All Ponies shouting)

129
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,090
(baby twins crying)

130
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,540
It's just what I feared,

131
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,680
an all-out Ice Cream War.

132
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,760
Quack... Newborn Twins
hungry, Baby Fifi.

133
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,510
Well, there is plenty
of ze ice cream for them to eat.

134
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,360
No, they can't have that.
It's been on the ground.

135
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,520
Oh, well.

136
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,140
I was saving this
for a special occasion.

137
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,610
It's the very last ice cream
I have.

138
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,690
(crying loudly)

139
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,620
Oh, Milkweed dear,
everything all right?

140
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,490
have some nice ice cream.

141
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,630
(slurping)

142
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,000
What you got there, Milkweed?

143
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,460
The secret recipe!

144
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,510
(gasps)
Then Fudgy didn't steal it.

145
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,750
Rocky must have gotten careless

146
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,250
and dropped it
in the ice cream mixture.

147
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,510
Come on, gang,

148
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,020
we're gonna put a stop
to this silliness.

149
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,060
Ya marshmallow maniac,

150
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,190
I'll stop you
if it's the last thing I do.

151
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,000
Aye, and it'll be
the last thing ya do!

152
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,740
Ya double-dip dog!

153
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,570
Oh...wait!

154
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,990
They gonna destroy
each other.

155
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,370
Watch it! I need to stop it.

156
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,710
(tires screeching)

157
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,010
Baby North Star,
are you all right?

158
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,560
- Look!
- The recipe.

159
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,520
We find in carton
of your ice cream.

160
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,530
Uh, I guess I do get
confused once in a while.

161
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,650
Well, Fudgy, looks like
I owe you an apology.

162
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,150
Can ya ever forgive me?

163
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,030
Old friend?

164
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,160
Of course,
