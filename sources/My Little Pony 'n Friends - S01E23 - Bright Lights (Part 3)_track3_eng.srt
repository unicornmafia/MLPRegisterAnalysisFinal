My son..

00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,520
Mother, can you ever forgive me
for what I've done?

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,740
You're my son,
I love you.

I didn't expect them
to hate me so much.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,660
What else did you expect
from them, my son?

26
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,540
You haven't earned their trust.

27
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,340
And Erebus possesses
their spirit and courage.

eh Zeb?

33
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,520
Yes, Master,
Knight Shade has done well.

34
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,020
I suggest we roll out
the red carpet

35
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:03,040
and give them all a welcome
they'll never forget.

Ah, my boy...

63
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,320
You've done well.

64
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,920
This is a fine assortment
of shadows.

65
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,530
(licks lips)
Mmm,

66
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,030
very fine indeed.

67
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,080
Surprise, Erebus!

68
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,420
As of right now,

69
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,280
I quit helping you
steal shadows.

70
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,600
You can't mean that.

71
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,090
I made you what you are.

72
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,090
That's right, you did.

73
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,600
But now I'm making
my own decisions.

74
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,060
That's right,
not only is he quitting,

75
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,680
but we want
everyone's shadow back

76
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,640
and we want them back NOW.

77
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,020
I can't afford to let you
turn on me, Knight Shade.

78
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,740
You and your friends
will pay dearly.

79
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,900
(Erebus hollers)

80
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,500
<i>The master said you'd pay...</i>

81
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,510
...and now, it's time
for me to collect.

82
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,500
Oh...Uh! Oh!

83
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,810
I'll take care of Zeb.

84
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,070
Find that satchel!

85
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,190
Okay, Knight Shade.

86
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:55,540
You fool, you're out
of your league here.

87
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,840
The satchel should be
in one of these rooms.

88
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,600
We can't help running!

89
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,350
What'll we do?

90
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,720
The bushes, quick!

91
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,670
Hm? Ah, hahahaha!

92
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,490
You can run, my little friends,
but you can't hide.

93
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:44,550
(surprised noises)

94
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,140
(pants)

95
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,390
<i>Split up and hide!</i>

96
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,060
It's our only chance.

97
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,320
There's the satchel.

98
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,070
Got it!

99
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,360
Now let's go find the others.

100
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,090
Ahh...Oh!

101
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,090
You girls oughta watch
where you're going.

102
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,010
(chuckles)

103
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,090
Come on, Molly,
we've gotta stop him.

104
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,050
Uh!

105
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,300
Oh, darlings!
I'm so sorry!

106
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,190
Are you both alright?

107
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,890
We're fine.
Have you seen Erebus?

108
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,060
Seen him? Seen him?

109
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,810
My darlings, we've been trying
to stay away from him.

110
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,410
(gasp)

111
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,120
Galaxy, use your light!

112
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,720
No you won't!

113
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,340
Zeb, Zeb, quickly!

114
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,680
Bring the satchel!

115
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,140
Keep back!

116
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,430
Mm..
(screams)

117
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,910
I hunger, Zeb!

118
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,830
Feed me!

119
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,610
My pleasure, master.

120
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,250
Let's get
Galaxy to safety.

121
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,630
So the Shadow Satchel seems to
be the source of Erebus' power.

122
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,100
And the longer Erebus
chased after us,

123
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,360
and used up his energy,

124
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,210
the smaller he became.

125
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,730
That's right!

126
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,300
So if we can keep him
exerting himself long enough,

127
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,350
we should be able to beat him.

128
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,620
But we'd need
an army for that.

129
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,980
Well, that's kind
of what I had in mind.

130
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,860
(somewhat weakly)
Quickly, I need more.

131
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,980
That one pony shadow
wasn't enough.

132
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,380
I need more
and I need it now.

133
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,400
But master,
there isn't any more.

134
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,300
And without Knight Shade
there's no way

135
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,910
to lure people to us.

136
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,330
I don't care, Zeb.

137
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,750
I need more shadows,
or I'll take yours!

138
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,380
Yes, yes..

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,920
Now!

140
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,050
(laugh)

141
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,260
Oh, come on!
I need your help.

142
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,230
Now remember..

143
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,190
I know, I know,
it's important.

144
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,430
Now remember, Lofty.

145
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,310
Stay low until
you get out of Grayvale.

146
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,830
We can't risk Erebus
spotting you.

147
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,100
We're counting on you.

148
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,990
Lofty, shouldn't
we stay lower?

149
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,860
You're right, Molly.

150
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,110
(caught off-guard)
Woah!

151
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,750
See, it's just so
hard flying like this.

152
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,170
(screams)
Lofty, help!

153
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,250
(gasps)

154
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,970
What a lovely little girl.

155
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,130
Your shadow is just right
for my collection.

156
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,960
(laughs)
