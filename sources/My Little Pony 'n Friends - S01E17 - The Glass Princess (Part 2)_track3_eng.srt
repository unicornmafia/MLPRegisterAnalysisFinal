00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,190
Must tell the little ponies!

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,060
(All)
Yeah, yeah! Tell Ponies!

13
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,550
Let's go! To Paradise Estate!

00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,370
(All)
Tell 'em! Tell 'em! Let s go!

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,030
(All)
Tell 'em! Tell 'em! Let s go!
Yeah yeah, tell 'em!

16
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,400
(Raptorians cackling)
Ooh ho ho ho ho hooo!

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,900
- Watch it!
- Oh! No!

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,650
- Ugh! Oof!
- Oof!

19
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,990
Oh boy! Soon we're
gonna have our own territory.

20
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,630
Yeah, more space than
we knows what to do with!

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,130
OK, let's move it!

22
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,330
We haven't got all day -
come on!

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,100
Hey, we're moving.
You needn't get rough.

24
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,340
Ow!

25
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,930
(Danny)
Geronimo!

26
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,260
(All squeal)

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,480
Danny!

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,480
Sorry, Danny is feeling
a little rambunctious today.

29
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,030
Today?

30
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,770
<i>Come on, come on! Tell ponies!
We've got to tell them!</i>

31
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,990
(All)
Tell ponies, tell ponies.

32
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,160
Gotta go to Paradise Estate.

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,660
(All)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

34
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,660
Stop!

35
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,780
(chaos)

36
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,780
(bubbles)
Stop!

37
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,290
Oh no, not again!

38
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,600
Ugh!

39
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,590
(All)
Tell 'em, tell 'em.
Tell 'em, yeah, tell 'em.

40
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,920
What's with you guys?

41
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,100
(All)
Thank you! Yeah, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

42
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,100
Thanks, thanks a lot. Thanks.

43
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,560
Well, what is it?

44
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,720
(breathing heavily)

45
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,850
Ponies kidnapped!

46
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,780
Yeah, ponies kidnapped!

47
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,310
(All)
Yeah, ponies kidnapped,
Yeah yeah kidnapped!

48
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,140
What do you mean,
the ponies have been kidnapped?

49
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,910
Raptorians come with nets
and take them away!

50
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,280
(All gasp)
Which ponies?

51
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,050
Lickety Split, Heart Throb
and Gusty.

52
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,450
(All gasp)
Oh no!

53
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,420
Well, which way
did they go?

54
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,160
The Black Mountains!

55
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,830
We must form a search party
and follow their trail

56
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,080
while it's still fresh.

57
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,460
Uhh, Magic Star, Paradise
and North Star,

58
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,340
you come with me
and the Bushwoolies.

59
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,850
The rest of you stay here
in case they manage to escape

60
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,140
and make their way back here.

61
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,970
(Bushwoolies)
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

62
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,440
Be careful.
Hurry back!

63
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,310
There must be something I can do
that no other pony can do.

64
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,240
There must be something!

65
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,230
My question is why?
What do they hope to gain?

66
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,910
Where in the world
have you been?

67
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,080
Have you heard, have you heard
about their kidnapping?

68
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,070
We're so worried.

69
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,530
What kidnapping?

70
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,790
What kidnapping?

71
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,990
A dozen Raptorians abducted

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,620
Lickety Split, Heart Throb
and Gusty

73
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,830
and took them with them
to the Black Mountains,

74
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,110
the Black Mountains.

75
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,040
Megan formed a rescue party
and went after them.

76
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,210
If only I hadn't been
so overly sensitive.

77
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,100
I should have stayed to listen

78
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,960
to what the other ponies
had to say.

79
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,340
But Shady,
you had no idea

80
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,020
that something
would happen to them.

81
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,010
But maybe I could
have helped them escape,

82
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,610
or I could have run for help,
or... Oh, dear!

83
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,770
Shady, it's not your fault.

84
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:37,560
Now I'm not only useless,
but I'm a deserter besides.

85
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,980
Deserter?

86
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,940
Oh, no! Not that, Shady.
No, never!

87
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,820
Wait a second, I don't get it -
what s she talking about?

88
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,320
(sobs)

89
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,480
Shady!

90
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,050
Shady! Shady,
come back!

91
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,290

- Bushwoolie fur?

111
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,940
It must be their
shedding season.

112
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,360
Maybe we better
follow the trail.

113
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,220
And we can be extra help
for everyone

114
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,870
in case they need it.

115
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,360
That's a brave idea.
Let's go.

116
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,860
Really?
You think so?

117
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,230
Ooh..welcome, welcome.

118
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,000
(laughs)

119
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,740
Ooh! Welcome, welcome!

120
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,160
Ooh! It's so beautiful.
It's perfect.

121
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,010
Just what I needed
to repair my cloak.

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,500
But first, the hair
must be absolutely squeaky clean

123
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,060
through the wash with them.

124
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,260
Look! over there.
It's Gusty's headband.

125
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,200
Our first clue.

126
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,270
(All)
Way to go, way to go,
way to go North Star?

127
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,790
The ponies must be around
here somewhere.

128
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,860
Spread out!

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,870
- Clues, clues..
- We want clues.

130
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,540
Hey! Megan.
Come here, quick!

131
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,680
This must be where
the Raptorians took the ponies.

132
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,770
So, what are we waiting for?

133
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,210
Come on! Help me push it.

134
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,300
Uh...It's no use.

135
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,270
We'll have to find
another way in.

136
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,520
But how?

137
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,110
Hey! our grand-daddies
used to live in these caverns.

138
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,980
We can find a way in there.

139
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,560
Wonderful!

140
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,400
(All)
Alright! Yeah! Yeah!

141
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,730
Wonderful.

142
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,320
Now, let me see.

143
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,200
Ah-ha this way.

144
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,650
(All)
Yeah, yeah, yeah this way!

145
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,130
No...
Thatta' way.

146
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,380
Thatta' way, thatta' way,
yeah, yeah, yeah!

147
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,000
Which way?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thatta' way.

148
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,670
Uh... But then again...

149
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,000
Mmm...

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,220
Move it, move it, move it.

151
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,300
(Raptorians cackle)

152
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,650
(magical incantation)
Kazim, Kazam, Kazoom...

153
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,720
(All gasp)

154
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,020
Ooh dear, this cloak
is practically worthless now.

155
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,760
Do something quick!

156
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,360
Not so tight!

157
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,490
Be sure they get good and clean.

158
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,240
Yes, yes.
Your most lovely highness.

159
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,490
(machinery creaks)

160
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,210
(switch clicks)

161
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,930
(boiler whistles)

162
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,790
(wheels ratchet)

163
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,350
(ratcheting continues)

164
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,490
Atchoo!

165
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,850
Soon, we'll have a better place
to live than this cramped dump

166
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,170
and we won't be needing
no Porcina, no more.

167
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,320
(All laugh)

168
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,110
If only I could do something
to save Heart Throb,

169
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,230
Lickety-Split, and Gusty
all by myself.

170
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,330
I owe them that much.

171
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,570
We'll figure out something.

172
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,570
I don't want
anybody else's help.

173
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,750
Well, I am coming
along with you, just in case.

174
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,370
Okay.

175
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,670
(laugh)
Snip! Snip! Snip!

176
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,960
Ooh..! Do you think
they'll hurt us?

177
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,210
No, Heart Throb.

178
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,090
Look, all they want is our hair.

179
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,970
After that, they'll let us go.

180
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,850
I don't know, Gusty.

181
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,710
I think they want
more than that.

182
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,470
That's right.

183
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,440
This won't be
the end of it my pretties,

184
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,810
not even when we have
harvested your lovely dresses.

185
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,030
Why, then your job
is just beginning

186
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,530
and then your precious Ponyland

187
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,570
will never be the same.

188
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,150
What do you mean?

189
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,370
Why, thanks to your hair

190
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,490
Porcina will turn
all of Ponyland into glass.

191
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,120
(All gasp)
