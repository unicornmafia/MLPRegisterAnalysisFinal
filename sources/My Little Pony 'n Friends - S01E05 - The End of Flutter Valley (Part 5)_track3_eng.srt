00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,220
(sighs)

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,760
(snoring)

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,730
Excuse me...

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,580
Uh, I think you'd better
wake up, your Bumbleness.

15
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,240
(snoring)

16
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,610
<i>WAKE UP, YOU BUMBLEHEAD!</i>

17
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,690
W...wh...what? Who? What?

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,210
What is it? What is it?

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,360
It's me, your Bumbleness.

20
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,880
I...I...I'm really sorry,

21
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,120
but I think you should know

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,870
that the Sunstone is
burning up the flowers.

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,020
Don't be ridiculous.

24
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,710
It's just heating them up.

25
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,380
But it burned my finger.

26
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,710
See.

27
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,630
Then be more careful next time.
Now be gone.

28
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,630
I'm not through
taking my nap.

29
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,190
I tried to warn her.
I really did.

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,560
It's getting awfully
warm in here.

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,860
What's going on outside?

32
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,130
Hey, watch where
you're dripping.

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,400
Sorry, Honeysuckle.

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,370
But there's nothing I can do.

35
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,040
There's nothing any of us
can do.

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,540
We could be stuck here forever.

37
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,880
Be brave, Flutter Ponies.

38
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,380
When Morning Glory
reaches Paradise Estate,

39
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,250
the little ponies will help us.

40
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,140
If Morning Glory
reaches Paradise Estate!

41
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,250
Sting,
can we talk for a minute?

42
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,150
What is it? I'm busy.

43
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,090
Well, if you keep the Sunstone,

44
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,350
we won't have a home anymore.

45
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,020
By sunset it will
wilt away to nothing.

46
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,030
You're breaking my heart,
Morning Glory.

47
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,360
Look, I just do what Bumble
tells me to do, understand?

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,830
Even if she
tells you to do bad things?

49
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,830
I'm good at bad things.

50
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,750
See?

51
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,500
But wouldn't it be more fun to
fly gracefully through the sky,

52
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,880
and play with your friends
in the white puffy clouds?

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,800
(sniffles)

54
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,290
What is it, Sting?

55
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,810
(Morning Glory)
What's wrong?

56
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,020
(sniffles)
I can't fly.

57
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,630
Well, that's silly.

58
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,950
I mean, all bees can fly.

59
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,690
Well, I used to fly,
but I wasn't very good.

60
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,030
So I just don't do it anymore.

61
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,230
Gee, if we only did
things we were good at,

62
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,370
we'd never try to make
ourselves better.

63
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,570
I think you should try again.

I can fly!

Oh, thanks, Morning Glory.

84
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,020
You're a good kid.

85
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,540
My pleasure, Sting.

86
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,060
Uh...
(coughs)

87
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,390
I-I think I'll go now.

88
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,910
I have to try and save
the other Flutter Ponies.

89
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,530
Bye!

90
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,570
Why did you do that?

91
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,540
I thought we were friends.

92
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,040
I've got a job to do,
Morning Glory,

93
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,550
and keeping you
in a cage is it.

94
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,330
I think it's ugly.

95
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,510
You're right. It is ugly.

96
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,850
You said it was filled with
colorful flowers

97
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,810
and green trees.

98
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,010
It is...

99
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,480
I mean, it was...

100
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,350
Oh, I mean it used to be.

101
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,430
(sniffs)
Phew, it smells terrible!

102
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,910
And what happened to the
Flutter Ponies?

103
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,160
Where are they?

104
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,450
The Flutter Ponies are gone.

105
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,020
My Little Ponies!

106
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,370
(cackles)

107
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,110
Bumble and her bees have them.

108
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,380
And we have Flutter Valley.

109
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,500
And there's nothing you
can do about it.

110
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,050
(cackles)

111
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,870
Oh, yeah?

112
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,510
Whoaaah ho ho!

113
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,940
Reeka, Draggle,
get those little ponies!

114
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,310
Oof! Whooooaaaah!

115
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,970
<i>I SAID GET THEM!</i>

116
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,570
Surprise!

117
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,480
Whoah!

118
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,030
(gasps)
Surprise!

119
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,370
What are you doing here?

120
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,230
We left you in Furbobia.

121
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,410
I had a feeling you
might need me.

122
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,660
(giggles)

123
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,170
Well, I've got a surprise
of my own.

124
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,040
Ahhg!
Get 'em.

125
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,470
Rooooooaaaaaggghhhr!

126
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,470
Run, little ponies, run!

127
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,980
Nice try, little ponies.

128
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,890
But you're mine now.

129
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,770
(laughs)

130
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,190
What you gonna do with us?

131
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,180
Oh, I'll think of something.

132
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,450
In the meantime,

133
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,320
we can all sit back and watch

134
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,070
the sun set together.
(laughs)

135
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,290
(snores)

136
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,040
Aaaahhh!

137
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,010
Pointer. Pointer?

138
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,870
Where are you?

139
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,770
You called, your Bumbleness?

140
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,630
Tell me something, Pointer,

141
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,020
do you see anything
unusual going on?

142
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,850
I, uh,

143
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,440
I think Bumbleland's on fire.

144
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,550
Very observant, Pointer.

145
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,450
Do something about it!

146
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,030
(gasps)
Bumbleland's on fire.

147
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,730
No wonder it's so hot.

148
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh no! We're trapped.

149
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,070
I guess Morning Glory

150
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,490
didn't make it
to Paradise Estate.

151
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,370
We don't know that,
Honeysuckle.

152
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,640
We can't give up hope.

153
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,160
Don't give up, Flutter Ponies.

154
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,660
The little ponies
will save us somehow,

155
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,090
I just know it.

156
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,760
Sometimes it's hard
not to give up hope.

157
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,010
What am I going to do?

158
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,520
My entire kingdom is burning!

159
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,760
Help!

160
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,640
(screams)
Ooh.

161
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,160
Oh! Whoah! Whoah!
Whoah! Whoah!

162
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,580
Load up, swarm.

163
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,760
Down here!

164
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,080
Drench the Sunstone!

165
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,950
Drop it!

166
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,540
(coughs)
Not me!

167
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,680
The Sunstone,
you bumblebrains!

168
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,800
Sorry, your Bumbleness.
We'll get some more.

169
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,930
No, we'll wait till
the fire burns itself out.

170
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,060
Then we'll return.
Let's get out of here.

171
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,060
You know,

172
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,860
I forgot just how good
it really feels to fly.

173
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,080
I'm glad I could
be of assistance.

174
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,570
(gasps)
Sting, look!

175
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,700
There's smoke coming
from Bumbleland.

176
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,470
It looks like a fire.
I'd better check it out.

177
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,910
Oh, no!

178
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,490
All the Flutter Ponies
are there.

179
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,010
Bumble? Pointer?
Where is everybody?

180
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,230
What did you find?

181
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,640
Bumbleland's on fire,
all right.

182
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,220
And all the bees are gone.

183
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,240
Sting, please let me out.

184
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,310
I have to save the rest
of the Flutter Ponies.

185
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,110
I can't, Morning Glory.

186
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,730
But you have to.

187
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,200
I thought we were friends.

188
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,740
We are friends.

189
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,990
Then you'll set me free?

190
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,190
No, I can't.

191
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,780
I'm still a bee.

192
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,660
Come back, Sting!

193
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,920
Help me!

194
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,200
(all)
Help! Somebody,
please help us! Help!
