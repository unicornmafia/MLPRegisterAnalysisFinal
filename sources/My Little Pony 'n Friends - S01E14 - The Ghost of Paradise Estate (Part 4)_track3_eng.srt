(laughs)

00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,110
(All gasp)

12
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,240
That shell!

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,420
Maybe I can move it
with my unicorn magic,

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,380
and put it between
these jaws to stop them.

15
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,250
Try it, Buttons.
Hurry!

16
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,210
All right!
It's working!

17
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,540
That's it, Buttons.
Take it nice and slow.

18
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,270
(All gasp)

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,320
You saved our lives,
Buttons.

20
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,810
Or bought us some time anyway.

21
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,290
Now if we can just get loose

22
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,040
before that shell gives out,

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,800
maybe we can stop Squirk

24
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,370
from turning Ponyland
into a giant aquarium.

25
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,830
Then, by cracky,
it's up to us, Pluma.

26
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,340
Maybe together,
we're strong enough.

27
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,500
Oh my!
I'll try it, grandfather,

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,000
but I just don't know
if I... I mean...

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,300
I'm not sure I can.

30
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,890
Doh, for Christ's sake, girl

31
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,090
Just quit belly-aching
and change!

32
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,480
It's working!
Your ropes, they're breaking.

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,120
Way to go, Grandpa.

34
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,910
Quick, everybody.

35
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,040
Jump!

36
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,090
Make your air bubbles, Fizzy,
so we can get out of here.

37
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,040
It won't be long now, Squirk.

38
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,610
Soon the whole land will be
flooded, and you'll rule again.

39
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,390
I know that, Crank.

40
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,100
Shut up!

41
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,400
(laughs)

42
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,330
I wonder if Squirk's found
the Flashstone yet.

43
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,910
We can find out easily enough.
Come on!

44
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,590
There's your answer.

45
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,350
How are we ever going
to stop him?

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,860
I think I know.

47
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,100
Come on!

48
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,980
Let's go back to Paradise Estate
and I'll show you.

49
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,600
It won't be long before the
water reaches here, I reckon.

50
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,280
We're not accomplishing anything
waiting for it.

51
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,620
Just hang on, Gusty.
It's Danny we're waiting for.

52
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,080
He thinks
he's figured out a way

53
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,030
to get the Flashstone
away from Squirk.

54
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,280
Look!

55
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,050
My nets!

56
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,460
Right, we can catch
Squirk and Crank in 'em

57
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,710
just like a couple of fish.

58
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,060
We just have to flush
those two out of the water

59
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,930
long enough to drop
the nets on 'em.

60
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,020
I think I know
a way to do that.

61
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,520
Okay, but we've still got to get
the Flashstone.

62
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,770
Leave that part to me.

63
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,990
There's no trace of Squirk.

64
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,650
You sure?

65
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,230
We've looked everywhere.

66
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,580
Then he must be down
there somewhere.

67
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,960
Keep circling and wait
for our signal.

68
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,080
Okay, Pluma,
you know what to do.

69
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,170
Oh, can't I do it once, Squirk?

70
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,010
Come on,
I never get to do nothing.

71
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,930
That's because I'm ruler,
and you're not.

72
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,940
Oh, I never get nothing to do.

73
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,070
Hey boss, look!

74
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,750
Let's check it out.

75
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,330
You! You've escaped!

76
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,120
Yes!

77
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,120
But we, uh,
we've come here to ask you...

78
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,100
that is, tell you actually,

79
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,380
that... well,
it's okay if you...uh,

80
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,350
if you want to rule us.

81
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,380
You've got
to be kidding.

82
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,650
Just stop flooding the land,
Squirk,

83
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,140
and we'll do whatever you want.

84
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,890
Maybe you'll even be,
you know, a good ruler.

85
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,400
(Spike)
Just don't get us wet, okay?

86
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,490
There he is.

87
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,740
The signal!

88
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,580
Let's go!

89
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,120
As the ruler's best friend,

90
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,670
I'd just like to say...

91
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,490
Shut up!

92
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,640
I'm so glad
you've all seen the light...

93
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,500
so to speak.

94
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,630
(cackles)

95
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:07,090
Uh, could I say one thing,
your Squirkiness?

96
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:07,670
What?

97
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,760
Drop it!

98
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,100
Hey! No! Agh!

99
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,530
Okay, Buttons,
do your stuff.

100
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,690
Get them, Squirk!
Blast them!

101
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,840
They can't do this to a ruler!

102
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,080
Shut up, and quit splashing.

103
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,850
You're lousing up my aim.

104
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,760
Hey!

105
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,340
Wind Whistler,

106
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,760
let's move.

107
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,600
<i>Come back with my Flashstone!</i>

108
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,650
Okay, Wind Whistler,
now we finish the job.

109
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,810
Here goes!

110
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,030
She's stopping the flood.

111
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,400
Do it again, Megan.

112
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,730
Make it go away.

113
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,320
(gulp)
Oh no...

114
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,050
The tide has turned, boss.

115
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,390
Agh! Do something!

116
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,300
You're the ruler,
you do something.

117
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,500
(screams)

118
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,090
(both scream)

119
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,270
(All cheer)

120
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,320
Well done, Megan.
Magnificent!

121
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,030

But why did you destroy
the Flashstone, Megan?

136
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,490
A power like the Flashstone's

137
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,490
can be used for evil
too easily, Fizzy.

138
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,860
We're all much
better off without it.

139
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,080
Maybe, but we couldn't have
gotten our home back without it.

140
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,420
That's right,
our home's okay now.

141
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,670
See, Baby Heart Throb?

142
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,540
I told you
it would be all right.

143
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,670
And I do hope you can forgive
me for pretending to be a ghost.

144
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,050
Well, next time you'll know that
we're your friends,

145
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,470
and you can trust us.

146
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,390
Speaking of home,

147
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,150
well, it's high time
we went back to ours.

148
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,850
Goodbye, everybody.

149
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,200
And thank you.

150
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,390
Thank you all for your help.

151
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,070
(All)
Goodbye! See you! Bye-bye!
