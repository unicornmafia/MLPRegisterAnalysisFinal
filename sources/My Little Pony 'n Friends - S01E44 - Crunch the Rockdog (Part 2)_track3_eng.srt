(laughs)

00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,120
(Evil laugh)

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,920
Gusty!

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,540
That rock-thing's
gonna be plum sorry

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,840
he messed with our Gusty...

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,040
She is beyond help.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,090
Logic clearly dictates
that we save ourselves.

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,350
Gosh, Wind Whistler,

18
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,810
how could you just go off
and leave poor Gusty?

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,850
What else would you
expect from somebody

20
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,430
with no feelings, Buttons?

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,610
No, Truly,
Wind Whistler's right,

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,550
we've gotta go on without Gusty.

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,820
Well, whatever we're gonna do,
let's snap it up.

24
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,780
Bye-bye, Gusty!
We'll be back!

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,980
She knows, Truly.
She knows.

26
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,230
Woah!

27
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,900
Track 'em!

28
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,550
Y'know, Gusty was on
the right track after all.

29
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,910
This one's for you, Gusty!

30
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,880
Buttons, don't!

31
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,960
Betcha can't catch me!

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,300
Oh Yeah?!
Another one?

33
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,220
Huh? Where'd she go?

34
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,170
Yoo-hoo!

35
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,050
Over here.

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,140
Hey, there she is.

37
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,810
She's drawing them off.

38
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,140
To the Mountains, then, quickly!

39
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,030
No, this way!

40
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,180
(groans)

41
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,680
Oh, I hope
Buttons is okay!

42
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,350
Oh, I'm sure
she's fine.

43
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,300
Buttons! Y'all did it!

44
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,270
It doesn't take
much to outsmart a rock.

45
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,850
Okay.

46
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,350
Now all we have to do is
find this Eminence guy.

47
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,860
The Moochick said if we go to
the Purple Mountains,

48
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,730
we couldn't miss him.

49
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,980
Greetings!

50
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,190
Uh.. Excuse me,
whoever you are,

51
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,370
but do you know
where we can find

52
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,490
His Elevated Eminence?

53
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,950
(laughs)
You're standing on him.

54
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,470
Remarkable!

55
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,240
This entire mountain
is a living, sentient being.

56
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,750
Greetings,
Your Elevated Eminence!

57
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,260
Uh.. yes, greetings,
Your Eminence.

58
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,080
We've come to ask
for your help.

59
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,760
You see, Crunch the Ro--

60
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,090
Oh, Crunch!

61
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,220
He is definitely out of control.

62
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,320
And it's all my fault.

63
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,060
You see, I needed a guard
to protect the Heartstone,

64
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,980
<i>which is the magical gem
that gives me feelings.</i>

65
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,450
<i>I created Crunch the Rockdog
to protect the gem,</i>

66
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,820
<i>but I neglected to put any
heart into Crunch himself,</i>

67
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,950
<i>accidentally creating a cold,</i>

68
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,090
<i>ferocious beast!</i>

69
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,170
<i>But I discovered
my mistake too late.</i>

70
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,090
<i>To make him indestructible,</i>

71
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,210
<i>I had put a piece of
Black Lava Rock,</i>

72
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,960
<i>from the roiling depths
of the Volcano of Gloom,</i>

73
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,210
<i>into his collar.</i>

74
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:46,850
<i>It gives Crunch the power
to turn anything to stone!</i>

75
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,190
There's only one thing
powerful enough to defeat him...

76
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,190
the Heartstone!

77
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,940
You must take it
and stop Crunch!

78
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,290
Well, I.. guess that doesn't
sound so difficult.

79
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,780
Where is the Heartstone,
anyway?

80
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,000
Deep within me.

81
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,490
And, how do we,
uh, get there?

82
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,870
I'll guide you.

83
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,510
But, I'm not exactly certain
what will happen

84
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,080
when the Heartstone
is removed.

85
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,810
W-what could possibly happen?

86
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,340
Which way?

87
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,310
To the left.

88
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,350
One more jaunt to the right
and you're there.

89
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,680
It's beautiful!

90
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,410
Take it, Megan!

91
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,690
Ooh..

92
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,650
Maybe I shouldn't...

93
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,530
Go ahead, my dear.

94
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,040
Which way, Your Eminence?

95
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,200
(screams)

96
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,250
Uh-oh!

97
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,250
(All yell)

98
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,120
Careful, Megan!

99
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,440
Give me my Heartstone!

100
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,850
What's the matter with him?

101
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,180
If His Eminence,

102
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,440
gets his feelings
from the Heartstone..

103
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,610
..Then without it, he's turning
into a major-league grouch!

104
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,890
Run!

105
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,720
Hurry!

106
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,700
This way!

107
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,700
- Hurry!
- This way!

108
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,620
Come on, let's go!

109
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,240
No! That way!

110
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,120
(cough)

111
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,540
(coughs)
Look!

112
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,240
(roars)
I've found you.

113
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,340
Who wants to be
turned to stone first?

114
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,380
You've gone too far
this time, Rockdog.

115
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,230
No, Truly!

116
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,500
No, Truly, don't go!

117
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,760
Stay here!

118
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,930
Go ahead.

119
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,270
Huh? Go ahead?

120
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,730
What are you
talking about?

121
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,310
What's the matter with you?

122
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,230
You really
don't like anyone, do you?

123
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,100
I mean it! Go ahead!

124
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,100
I don't care
what you do with her.

125
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,780
You're crazy
if you think I'll buy that.

126
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,490
I'm perfectly serious.

127
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,280
I've been surrounded by these
romantic idiots for so long,

128
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,660
it is refreshing
to find one such as yourself.

129
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,960
Wind Whistler!
How could you?

130
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,250
Pay no attention
to them, Crunch!

131
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,840
You really don't care
what I do to her?

132
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,960
That sentimental fool?
Certainly not.

133
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,180
Good, cause
I'm gonna turn her to stone!

134
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,510
Haha! I thought so!

135
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,530
You do care, don't you?

136
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,560
Wait!

137
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,020
I'll prove I'm on your side.

138
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,140
By giving you your next victim.

139
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,900
Yeah, that's it, Wind Whistler,
bring me to him.

140
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,820
The Heartstone!

141
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,370
Please, Heartstone,
do something.

142
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,720
No!

143
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,410
(yaps)

144
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,750
It worked!
She's alright!

145
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,650
(cheer)

146
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,890
Hey you guys,
look, it's me!

147
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,240
Hooray, it's Gusty!

148
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,060
I knew you wouldn't turn
against us, Wind Whistler.

149
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,650
Yeah, yeah! We're okay,
we're okay!

150
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,910
Yeah, yeah, fine!
I feel good!

151
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,920
Hooray! We found you!
(laughing)

152
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,360
Stop laughing! Stop cheering!

153
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,410
Why are you so happy?

154
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,870
There's nothing
to be happy about.

155
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,210
Stop it or I'll bite ya.

156
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,170
I bet all he needs
is a little heart.

157
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,170
Yeah, then
he'd be a nice puppy.

158
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,890
(yaps)

159
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,600
Now hold still!

160
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,710
Look..!

161
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,230
I can't believe
how happy he looks!

162
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,100
Well, of course he does!

163
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,300
(yaps)

164
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,060
Well, I guess we'd better get
this back to His Eminence

165
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,530
before he turns

Thank you
for all your help!

182
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,300
I'm pleased that Crunch
now has a heart of his very own.

183
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,180
Goodbye! Goodbye, Eminence!
Bye bye!

184
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,570
Wind Whistler, uh, we're sorry
we said you had no feelings.

185
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,690
And we, uh, we wanna
thank you for doing

186
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,570
what you did back there.

187
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,700
Why? Logic alone dictated
my actions.

188
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,370
It would have been
too much trouble to carry

189
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,150
three heavy stone statues
all the way home.

190
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,670
Just kidding!
