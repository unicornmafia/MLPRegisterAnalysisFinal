(Stonebacks snorting)

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,130
Help! Help!
Somebody! Help us!

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,930
(snorts)

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,250
- Somebody!
- Anybody!

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,760
Stop, Stonebacks.

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,480
Don't do this.

16
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,730
(All scream)
Help!

17
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,940
I'll make a parachute.

18
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,720
Oh, Fizzy, thank you.

19
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,540
Oh, we're safe.

20
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,770
Oh, thank goodness we're safe.

21
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,970
(All)
Yeah! Yeah, safe! Safe!

22
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,980
(snorts)

23
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,310
Why don't
the Stonebacks like you?

24
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,450
(All)
Yeah, why? Why, why?
Why not? Why?

25
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,570
Because we wouldn't
play with them.

26
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,540
That's not why.
It's because they smell bad.

27
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,790
They don't smell bad.

28
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,040
We've been fighting so long,

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,620
I guess we don't remember
why we're fighting.

30
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,300
My leg hurts.

31
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,720
Oh, Baby Cuddles.
What happened?

32
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,260
Don't know.
Can't walk.

33
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,300
And it's a long way
back to Paradise Estate.

34
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,250
Come home
to Furbobia with us.

35
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,520
We'll fix you up.

36
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,390
- This way.
- That way.

37
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,850
This had better work, Reeka.

38
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,900
I desperately want
that Sunstone.

39
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,780
Oh, don't worry, Bumble.

40
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,490
Is your swarm ready?

41
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,530
They but await
my special signal.

42
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,160
A special signal?

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,080
Then get ready to give it.

44
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,370
Smirtlab, wilmot,
crock and zerb!

45
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,120
Look, a rainbow.

46
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,930
Isn't it beautiful?

47
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,350
But it didn't even rain.

48
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,260
Proceed after me, swarm.

49
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,890
That's the worst
special signal I ever heard.

50
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,390
Take it to Bumbleland.

51
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,730
They're stealing
our Sunstone.

52
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,660
I knew it.
This rainbow's a phony.

53
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,990
Hurry!

54
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,160
We have to get the Sunstone
back before sunset,

55
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,790
or Flutter Valley will die.

56
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,640
Farewell, Flutter Ponies.

57
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,580
The Valley's ours now.

58
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,210
(laughs)

59
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,550
We're gaining on them.

60
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,440
To the hives!

61
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,080
(gasp)
They've gone into Bumbleland.

62
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,020
Wait!
What if it's a trap?

63
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,660
We can't argue
about it now.

64
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,610
Let's go.

65
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,750
Sting,
prepare the honeycomb.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,420
Where did you go?

67
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,840
Yes, your bumbleness.
Right away.

68
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,220
What are you doing?

69
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,790
I'm going.
I'll get the honeycomb ready.

70
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,680
Okay?
I'll get it.

71
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,630
Oh, how does anything
ever get done around here?

72
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,850
(gasp)
The Sunstone!

73
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,800
I don't think
it's a good idea.

74
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,820
Why doesn't anybody
listen to me?

75
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,020
Let's get it.

76
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,290
Wait!

77
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,890
Help!

78
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,370
We're trapped!

79
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,620
We can't get out!

80
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,330
(laughs)

81
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,620
You're mine now,
my little Flutter Ponies.

82
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,460
And I've got
some marvelous plans for you.

83
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,710
But first...

84
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,490
(slurps)

85
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,480
Sting, place the Sunstone
to reflect the sun.

86
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,390
Bring forth those golden rays
that will make Bumbleland

87
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:03,060
drip with rich,
nectar-bearing flowers!

Flutter Valley will be
just the way we like it.

109
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,140
(All)
Wilted!

110
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,100
(cackles)

111
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,480
Aww, are we getting
close to Furbobia?

112
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,730
- No!
- Yes!

113
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,310
I think we'd better
rest for a while.

114
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,690
Me too heavy?

115
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,780
Don't you worry about a thing,
Baby Cuddles.

116
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,660
Everything's going to be fine.

117
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,410
Cupcake is right.

118
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,410
That leg of yours
will be fixed up in no time.

119
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:44,990
Right, Furbobs?

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,590
- Definitely!
- Maybe!

121
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,860
Ahh, Gee, I wish we
could have some apples.

122
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,010
Yeah, an apple.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,170
- Me too!
- I want one.

124
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,170
Gosh, Wishful.

125
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,500
That was terrific.

126
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,520
You mean all you have to do
is make a wish

127
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,710
and you get what you wish for?

128
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,630
(gasp)
Gosh!

129
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,540
Well, it doesn't
work all the time.

130
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,810
No, not all the time.

131
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,680
- Sometimes. Once in a while.
- Rarely.

132
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,600
I think we'd better be
moving on to Furbobia.

133
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,050
The sun is going to set soon.

134
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,150
Ready, little ponies?

135
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,060
Ready.
Let's do it.

136
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,690
Lift!

137
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,190
To Furbobia!

138
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,490
Ouch! Huh?

139
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,310
I think it's that way.

140
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,580
(snorts)

141
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,620
On second thought,
maybe it's that way?

142
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,500
(snorts)

143
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,580
(gasps)

144
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,000
I wonder
if they speak our language.

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,330
(snorts)

146
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,510
I don't think so.

147
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,050
What are we going to do?

148
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,850
- Yeah, what?
- Yeah, what?

149
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,220
Maybe I could snort to them.

150
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,350
I heard my dad do it once
a long time ago.

151
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,600
(snorts)

152
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,230
What did you say, Spike?

153
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,110
I...I don't know...

154
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,040
Oh, goodie, goodie!

155
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,500
I can't wait.

156
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,360
(slurps)

157
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,120
More!
I want more!

158
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,590
Don't you think you ought
to wait a few minutes?

159
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,710
I've been waiting
a lifetime for this, Sting.

160
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,710
Get me some more.

161
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,710
Ah...yes, your Bumbleness.
Whatever you say.

162
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,850
Do you still want to turn
the other wing, Morning Glory?

163
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,200
There must be a
simple explanation

164
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,060
for this seemingly mean act.

165
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,270
There is.

166
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,700
Bumble got the Sunstone,
the witches got Flutter Valley,

167
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,960
and we got...

168
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,700
Honeysuckle, Morning Glory,
what's done is done.

169
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,780
What we have to do now
is get out of here.

170
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,080
We have one chance,
Flutter Ponies.

171
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,960
If we try very hard,

172
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,080
maybe we can blow down
these walls and escape.

173
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,550
We can do it, Rosedust.

174
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,050
We're with you!
We'll try anything!

175
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,720
Let's do it.

176
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,300
All right, Flutter Ponies.

177
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,170
Shift to Utter Flutter!

178
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,510
Release the honey!

179
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,360
There is no escape now,
Flutter Ponies.

180
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,190
You will be my slaves!

181
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,580
(slurps)

182
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,700
Yes, slaves!

183
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,200
(cackles)
