(sniffles)

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,620
Maybe they
look for us right now?

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,020
Let us out of here!

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,590
(sniffles)

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,010
We've got
to find our babies!

16
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,850
Save your breath.
They won't let us go.

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,380
But we
didn't do anything.

18
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,860
Didn't do anything?
You've done plenty.

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,450
Or rather,
your friend Knight Shade did.

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,190
We don't know what's wrong,

21
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,110
but we're not gonna let you do
that to the rest of 'em.

22
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,390
But Knight Shade
is not our friend.

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,320
So you say...

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,580
Say.. I've got it.

25
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,070
Mr. Mayor, look at the
sick children.

26
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,740
They cast no shadows.

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,450
That's the reason
they're sick.

28
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,380
Knight Shade must have stolen
their shadows.

29
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,640
That makes sense.

30
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,080
No doubt they
feel empty and incomplete.

31
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,580
The loss of their shadows
being an outward sign

32
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,080
of some loss of substance.

33
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,600
Please, Mr. Mayor, you must
let us go.

34
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,800
What happened to your children

35
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,980
could be happening to
the Baby Ponies right now.

36
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,490
We must be free
to stop this Knight Shade.

37
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,100
Well, perhaps
I will let you go.

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,930
(cheer)

39
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,910
But, Sheriff Ricotta and I will
go with you.

40
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,280
You'll need our help to get past
our nasty cousins, the Roadies!

41
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,280
(crying)

42
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,500
Nobody comin' to save us..

43
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,450
Where grown-ups?

44
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,700
Can't give up!

45
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,850
Hey...let's sing!

46
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,510
(All crying)

47
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,930
I wonder where the
Baby Ponies could be?

48
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,780
<i>(crying continues)</i>

49
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,020
Our babies!

50
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,610
The coast is clear.

51
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,620
We're so glad
we've found you.

52
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,890
But you're so pale.

53
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,540
We're sick..

54
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,470
Knight Shade stole shadows..

55
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,170
Well, he's not gonna get
away with it.

56
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,890
We're going to make him
give those shadows back.

57
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,150
(Molly)
There he is.

58
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,390
Let's go after him.

59
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,590
Where?

60
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,720
He's on his way to his trailer.

61
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,020
Let's go get him!

62
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,520
What is that
in the mirror?

63
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,180
It looks as
if that looking-glass

64
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,530
could use a good cleaning to me.

65
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,780
You fiend!

66
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,780
You'd better give our babies'
back their shadows or else!

67
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,930
We're gonna make you pay

68
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,500
for what you did
to our children.

69
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,750
Yep!

70
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,130
<i>(All)
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!</i>

71
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,420
We've gotta catch Knight Shade.

72
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,390
Or we'll never get
our babies' shadows.

73
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,480
Look at that!

74
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,880
Uh...oh...uh...

75
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,620
I didn't wanna do it.

76
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,500
I didn't wanna do it.

77
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,580
Then why did you?

78
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,550
He made me do it.

79
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,380
Who?

80
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,920
Erebus.
He's a wizard.

81
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,050
He looks like a big,
gray storm cloud.

82
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,260
That must be the
thing we saw in the mirror.

83
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,480
Yes!

84
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,940
That's how
he gives me my orders.

85
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,310
What kind of orders?

86
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,260
To steal shadows for him.

87
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,070
Although Zeb is the one
who actually steals 'em.

88
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,940
He puts them
in his satchel.

89
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,240
You mean, the babies' shadows

90
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,200
were in the satchel
he was carrying?

91
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,070
Yeah,
that's right!

92
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,120
And we let him get away...

93
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,360
Was he taking them to Erebus?

94
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,240
Yeah!

95
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,840
So you see, I couldn't
give back your babies' shadows.

96
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,080
I haven't got 'em.

97
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,370
What does Erebus do
with the shadows?

98
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,420
I don't know exactly,
but they give him power.

99
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,540
Power which he uses to make me
do what he wants.

100
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,210
<i>You see, I come from Grayvale,</i>

101
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,430
<i>a place that used
to be called Bright Valley.</i>

102
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,510
<i>I tried my best
as a singer there,</i>

103
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,810
<i>but nobody
came to see me.</i>

104
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,350
<i>I was ready to give up,</i>

105
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,310
<i>then Erebus came along.</i>

106
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,230
<i>He said he was a wizard
and promised to make me a star</i>

107
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,490
<i>All he said
he wanted in return..</i>

108
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,030
<i>was a little cooperation.</i>

109
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,230
<i>The first concert he promoted
in Bright Valley was a smash.</i>

110
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,870
<i>Everyone in town was there.</i>

111
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,250
<i>(cheering)</i>

112
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,820
<i>And while I was singing,</i>

113
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,540
<i>Erebus had Zeb steal
everyone's shadow -</i>

114
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,300
<i>including my own mother's.</i>

115
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,480
<i>When I saw what
Erebus had done,</i>

116
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,050
<i>I refused to work
for him anymore,</i>

117
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,270
<i>and I demanded that he give
everyone their shadows back!</i>

118
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,140
<i>But he threatened
to steal my shadow..</i>

119
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,760
<i>(evil laugh)
...and he laughed at me.</i>

120
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,760
<i>I didn't know then</i>

121
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,260
<i>that the shadows provided
Erebus with energy</i>

122
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,770
<i>that gave him his
magical powers.</i>

123
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,660
<i>And he used the energy
from the shadows</i>

124
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,770
<i>to make himself
into this huge cloud of energy.</i>

125
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,570
<i>I don't know how he does that-</i>

126
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,450
<i>it's a closely guarded secret.</i>

127
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,330
<i>I'm not even sure Zeb knows.</i>

128
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,500
<i>Then Erebus made me take my act
on the road,</i>

129
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,030
<i>and he sent Zeb along to
do the shadow stealing.</i>

130
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,250
<i>And as I became famous,</i>

131
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,450
<i>more fans came to see me.</i>

132
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,370
<i>Zeb stole more shadows</i>

133
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,340
<i>and Erebus became
even more powerful.</i>

134
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,920
<i>his hunger for power is
endless.</i>

135
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,440
<i>And I'm forced to help
Zeb supply him</i>

136
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,300
<i>with more and more shadows.</i>

137
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,880
<i>If I don't help him,
he'll steal my shadow,</i>

138
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,220
<i>which would end my career.</i>

139
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,180
<i>But worse, it would mean that</i>

140
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,700
<i>I'd never have any hope of
restoring Grayvale</i>

141
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,190
<i>and my mother,
to the way they used to be.</i>

142
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,310
Please let him go,

143
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,900
he didn't really wanna hurt us.

144
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,060
What do you think?

145
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,540
Well, the poor creature
didn't have any choice, did he?

146
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,370
Thank you, Baby Heart Throb.

147
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,920
You know, you're so lucky
to have loved ones

148
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,410
who care about you so much.

149
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,890
I have a wonderful mother,

150
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,180
but she--

151
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,250
(sniffles)

152
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,220
she has to live with
the terrible shame of

153
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,470
what I've done,

154
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,810
to her and Grayvale.

155
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,680
(All crying)

156
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,010
I think we oughta
help Knight Shade.

157
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,400
You mean we should
fight Erebus ourselves?

158
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Exactly!

159
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,820
That's the only way
we'll ever get

160
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,770
the babies' shadows back.

161
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,070
And our
children's shadows, too.

162
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,320
(sniffles)
Yup.

163
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,070
And my mother's,
and the rest of Grayvale's.

164
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,250
Well, what are we waiting for,
guys?

165
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,420
Knight Shade, show us
the way to Grayvale.

166
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,950
(All)
Alright! Yeah!

167
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,010
Where is everybody?

168
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,840
I think
they must be in hiding.

169
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,690
Knight Shade...

170
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,390
Knight Shade...

171
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,690
Knight Shade!

172
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,370
(gasp)

173
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,410
You've got a lot of nerve
coming back here, Knight Shade.

174
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,540
(menacingly)
