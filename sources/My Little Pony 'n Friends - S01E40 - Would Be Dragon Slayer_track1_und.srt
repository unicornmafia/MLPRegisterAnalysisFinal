And now!

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,960
Gingerbread and Shady

13
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,620
will compete in

Yaay!

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,040
(screams)
HELP! HELP! HELP!

18
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,500
HELP!

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,000
No one helps dragons!

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,840
Oh no, well,
you're absolutely wrong.

21
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,970
We do and this is how we do it!

22
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,300
(in pain)
Oh, uggh!

23
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,560
Yeah, Whizzer.

24
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,140
Hey!
Who blew out the candles?

25
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,660
Stand still beast.

26
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,180
Meet your fate like a man!

27
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,480
But I'm not a man!

28
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,780
I'm a dragon!

29
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,270
Whooaaoohh!

30
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,860
(screams)

31
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,740
Hang in there, Spike!

32
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,120
You've caused enough trouble
with that.

33
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,370
Now, who are you

34
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,920
and why are you trying
to hurt our friend?

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,790
I am Squire Alonso

36
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,010
and this is my
faithful steed, Panza

37
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,710
And I wasn't trying
to hurt your dragon.

38
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,600
I was trying to slay him,

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,460
to do a good deed.

40
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,810
How is getting rid of me
a good deed, huh?

41
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,600
Tell me, huh, huh!

42
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,530
Everyone knows dragons are evil.

43
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,140
That's not true!

44
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,770
(speaking together)
Spike s a real friend!
Spike s a nice little dragon!

45
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,820
I think, we're in trouble again.

46
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,780
But I read all about dragons.

47
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,980
They always catch princesses
and hold them in dungeons.

48
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,790
Not this dragon.

49
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,000
He's my friend!

50
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,460
I'm sorry, Spike.

51
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,790
Please forgive me.

52
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,570
It's just that
I must do a good deed

53
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,920
to become a knight.

54
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,050

I say,
let's help this guy.

76
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,280
He sure needs it.

77
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,800
Something tells me we can find
a good deed for you to do.

78
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,240
You think so?

79
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,570
Hmpf!
Here we go again.

80
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,170
I know you'll do a good deed
with just a little help.

81
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,660
So we're gonna help him,
huh, huh?

82
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,340
Yeah, let's help him!

83
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm willing.

84
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,050
Let's do it!

85
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,600
Aww, whose idea was this, huh?

86
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,250
We've been walking,

87
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,100
and walking, and walking.

88
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,260
Spike,

89
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,680
we're helping
a would-be knight

90
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,930
to do a good deed!

91
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,600
We're helping a
would-be dragonslayer.

92
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Megan, listen.

93
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,930
And look!

94
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,360
A castle!

95
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,830
But why is there a wall
of briars around it?

96
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,540
Must be like a moat.
To keep people out.

97
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,780
(Woman singing in the distance)
That voice.

98
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,660
It's so beautiful.

99
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,120
It must belong to a princess.

100
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,840
Maybe she's trapped
inside...in trouble.

101
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,550
We've got to rescue her.
Right now!

102
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,670
Briar wall?
It's so big!

103
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,270
I can light the
way with my horn.

104
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,880
Great!
Then let's go!

105
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,860
(gasps for breath)

106
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,780
Finally!
The outer wall.

107
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,900
Good work, Alonso.

108
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,890
Hello! You in there,
in the castle.

109
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,290
I, Squire Alonso,
am here to rescue you.

110
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,200
Over here.
I found a door.

111
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,500
Come on.

112
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,470
Oops!

113
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,090
It's Sir Huguenot

114
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,460
The bravest knight of all time.

115
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,970
His lady Princess Aileen.

116
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,810
And Emelita, Aileen's
fairy godmother.

117
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,480
So, who need rescuing?

118
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,340
No one needs rescuing.

119
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,590
Who are you?

120
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,840
Why have you intruded
on the wedding feast

121
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,360
of my godchild
and her groom?

122
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,430
Wedding feast?
Oh, no!

123
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,700
We thought the briars were there
to keep the princess a prisoner.

124
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,240
I conjured up the briar ring
to keep her out of trouble.

125
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,030
This hero, Aileen's wed,
attracts misadventure,

126
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,530
the way an old bone
attracts dogs!

127
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,330
Not anymore
my dear Emelita.

128
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,210
I've retired.

129
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,630
You mean, you've
given up your quests?

130
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,220
Quests are for younger men.

131
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,510
I ask Moffat here,
the wizard at court,

132
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,010
to find a replacement
to serve my king.

133
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,940
A replacement?
I'd do anything.

134
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,310
Well, gee Alonso,

135
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,200
Maybe we should leave.

136
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,280
An excellent idea.

137
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,140
Music - play.

138
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,400
Uh, so sorry
for the intrusion.

139
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:50,280
Good night.

140
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,800
I was so dumb.

141
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,650
And in front of the wizard.

142
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,170
Oh, cheer up, Alonso.

143
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,330
We could still find
a good deed for you to do.

144
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,490
Sure.
In eighty years or so,

145
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,010
when I'm too old
to lift a sword...

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,300
Maybe we should all go back
to Paradise Estate and rest up.

147
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Yes. Let's go back and
everybody can take a rest.

148
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,190
I guess, I just don't have
what it takes to be a knight.

149
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,230
Hey! What are you
throwin' at me?

150
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,490
Huh?

151
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,610
It's bad enough that
I'm stuck on my back.

152
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,000
Now, you're gonna
throw things at me?

153
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,020
Well, are you gonna
help me turn over?

154
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,870
Oh, yeah!
Sure.

155
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,490
Let me...

156
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,290
(grunts and groans)

157
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,500
Come on. That's it. Good try.

158
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,020
Hey, what's the matter?

159
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,510
You're so heavy!

160
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,260
Great. Now, you make
cracks about my weight.

161
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,390
Alonso, I hope you're not
thinking of this as giving up

162
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,780
Hey, Alonso.

163
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,350
She is been nice to you.
Why don't you talk to her?

164
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,820
You know,
you've gotta be nice and...

165
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,690
Alonso is missing!

166
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,530
We'd better go look for him!

167
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,730
I have a feeling
he's in trouble.

168
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,980
Come on!

169
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,900
(grunts and groans)

170
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,780
I knew it...

171
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,830
The simplest little
thing I can't do right.

172
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,160
Great. I'm stuck
and the only guy

173
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,830
who can do me
a good deed is a quitter.

174
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,130
I'm not a quitter!

175
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,910
I just don't have any way
to turn you over.

176
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,180
Huh!

177
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
Wait a minute!

178
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,090
Call me a quitter, huh?

179
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,720
What are ya gonna do?

180
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,070
(breathing heavily)
This is the place

181
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,260
where we saw him last.

182
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,860
Oh, what'll I do
without him around?

183
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,350
He's such a nice guy.

184
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:52,770
One, two, three, and ugghhhh!

185
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,030
Congratulations!

186
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,170
You've just passed
the top-up-turtle test!

187
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,620
I did? I have?

188
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,790
Yes!

189
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,010
I was looking for
a replacement for Sir Huguenot,

190
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,430
and I decided to give you
a little test.

191
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,100
Now, I know
I've found that replacement

192
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,930
I was looking for - You!

193
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,280
Me?

194
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,770
Yes, my boy.

195
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,220
Not everyone would have kept
going when things were that bad.

196
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,650
I need a knight
who won't give up.

197
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,790
A true knight! A knight with
a stout heart.

198
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,030
You got him!

199
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,660
And I'm taking him with me.

200
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,240
Well, I can't leave
without thanking you first.

201
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,630
If not for you, I might have
given up a long time ago.

202
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,880
You had it in you all the time.

203
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,210
Bye, bye.

204
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,060
And remember...
Be nice to dragons.

205
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,630
I will, Spike.

206
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,150
And I'll remember
all of you, too.

207
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,390
Always!

208
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,640
Good bye.

209
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,340
Good bye, bye, bye...

210
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,820
Bye, bye...

211
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,160
You know.

212
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,600
For a would-be dragonslayer,
he wasn't that bad.

213
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,860
Spike!

214
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,750
(laughs)
