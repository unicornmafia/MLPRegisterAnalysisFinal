10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,450
We better think of
something quick.

11
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,580
And this is one hot
bath we won't enjoy!

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,840
I wish I was not suffering

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,430
from a singular lack
of inspiration.

14
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,010
Wishing! Of course, there're
still two coins left.

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,340
Oops!

16
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:52,970
(coins cling)

17
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,510
Phew!

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,470
But which one will do the
trick without backfiring on us?

19
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,810
This is no time for
a equivocation.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,050
Hit one quickly!

21
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,810
I wish we were as
light as a feather.

22
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:05,950
But only momentarily.

23
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,900
(both scream)

24
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,870
The wish worked!

25
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,870
Yeah! The wish worked!

26
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,900
(Megan chuckles)
This is fun.

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,210
Uh!

28
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,880
Bet Niblick's never seen a
treasure like this one.

29
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,250
Does it look like I
need another ruby?

30
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,500
(box slams)

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Three tries is all you get.

32
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,430
But I'm not such a bad guy.

33
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,570
So I'm gonna let ya live.

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,230
On one condition!

35
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,730
Uhhh...what might that
be, Mr. Niblick?

36
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,930
GET OUTTA HERE! NOW!

37
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,620
(indistinct groaning)

38
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,440
Awww... Looks like we blew it.

39
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,040
I'll be happy to guide you
back to Ponyland, folks.

40
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,780
If that's where you're going.

41
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,120
Where else can we go?

42
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,080
I just hope the baby
Seaponies are okay.

43
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,850
It's all the water I can find.
Sorry!

44
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,600
Don't blame yourself, Shady.

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,550
There's no water anywhere.

46
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,070
Gotta be water some place.

47
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,310
I find some.

48
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,540
Baby Lofty, wait!

49
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,200
No water.

50
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,150
(crow caws)

51
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,460
Oops!

52
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,120
(glass breaks)

53
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,880
No water, Molly.

54
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,760
That's okay, baby, you tried.

55
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,820
(fire enkindles)

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,650
Something better happen soon.

57
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,070
I say look there!

58
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,320
I do believe it's a fire.

59
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,490
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind.

60
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,080
I'll check it out.

61
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,800
It is a fire...coming this way!

62
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,340
We've got to evacuate
the nursery.

63
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,270
Hiya! Where're we going?

64
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,930
Ah, it's fun!

65
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,130
(giggles)
Whee!

66
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,280
Get the baby Seaponies too!

67
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,300
The rest of us can start
digging firebreaks.

68
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,280
Looks bad, Ribbon.
You can't stop it.

69
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,250
We'll fight it as
long as we can.

70
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,960
But tell the others to get
ready to abandon Dream Valley.

71
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,580
Oh, no!

72
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,970
Come on!

73
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,750
(Danny)
We better not wait
any longer, Ribbon.

74
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,250
We <i>gotta leave!</i>

75
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,680
All right, let's--

76
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,010
Look! Over there!

77
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,220
It looks like Megan
and the others!

78
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,820
Maybe they found a
way to make it rain!

79
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,590
(Megan)
What're we gonna do?

80
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,910
Can't stop it.

81
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,410
There's only one chance, Megan.

82
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,150
Try the last coin.

83
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,080
Maybe you can
wish the fire out.

84
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
It's worth a try.

85
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,110
I wish the fire was <i>out!</i>

86
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,780
It isn't working!

87
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,420
It must be the wrong
coin for that wish!

88
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,950
(coughs)

89
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,090
Wind Whistler! Am I
ever glad to see you?

90
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,340
Climb on, hurry!

91
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,540
Thanks for saving my life.

92
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,560
I can hardly do
otherwise, Megan.

93
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,260
I would risk anything
for a friend.

94
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,860
For friendship after all is the

95
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,350
most important treasure
there is.

96
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,560
Friendship!

97
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,030
The clasped hands of course!

98
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,200
Now, I know what to do!

99
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,660
Megan! Is there any hope for us?

100
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,150
I think so,
if there's still time!

101
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,780
Keep fighting the fire.

102
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,460
Whistler, fly faster than
you've ever flown before!

103
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,960
You heard her,
let's do what we can!

104
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,910
Where we going, Megan?

105
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,260
Back to Niblick's house.

106
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,760
Mr. Niblick, Mr. Niblick!

107
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,100
(door slams)
You again?

108
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,680
You gotta lot of nerve showin'
your face around here.

109
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,580
Wait! I have a perfect treasure
for youe

110
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,150
and it'll come from
one of your own coins!

111
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,830
This better be good or else...

112
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,250
It will be!

113
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,620
I hope, I wish...

114
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,250
(All scream)
Run for it! Run! Help! Let's go!

115
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,440
Oh! What a pit--

116
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,100
Hey!
Who asked ya?

117
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,050
I might as well see
what the inside is like,

118
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,180
though I know
I am going to regret it.

119
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,970
Incredible!

120
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,220
What did you do?

121
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,490
Have a bunch of ogres
down for the weekend?

122
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,530
Well... Maybe I did let it go...
A little...

123
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,870
Oh! You can say that again.

124
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,990
Why not open a window?
Or Seven...

125
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,320
(indistinct muttering)

126
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,460
(indistinct muttering)

127
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,010
(Megan gasps)

128
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,090
You!
This was your doing.

129
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,470
It-it seemed like a
good idea at that time.

130
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,740
A good idea?

131
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,230
It was a great idea!

132
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,910
- It was?
- Sure!

133
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,730
I didn't realize
how lonely I was.

134
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,110
And this place sure could use
someone who likes to clean!

135
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,580
I don't believe it.
What did you wish for, Megan?

136
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,620
Only the greatest treasure
of all, a friend.

137
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,450
(Niblick)
This guy's worth more than all
the magic coins in Ponyland.

138
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,960
Name your price?

139
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,340
Undo the effects of the coins,
starting with the weather spell.

140
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,420
You got it!

141
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,470
(thundering)

142
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,960
(singing in harmony)
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo

143
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,150
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo

144
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,570
(cheer and laughter)

145
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,330
It's so nice to have
everything back to normal.

146
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,750
You said it!

147
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,330
(bubbling)

148
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,560
I got my old bubbles back!

149
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,250
And we got our water back!

150
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,680
I-uh...I don't know
how to thank ya.

151
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,900
I mean this guy maybe a pain

152
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,100
when it comes to
keeping things neat,

153
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,820
but he...well, I never had a...

154
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,240
I know what you're
trying to say, Niblick.

155
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,660
