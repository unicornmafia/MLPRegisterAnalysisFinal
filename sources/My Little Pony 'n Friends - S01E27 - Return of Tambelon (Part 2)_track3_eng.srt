10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,040
Nearly all the little ponies
and their friends

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,880
have been captured, master.

12
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,120
Nearly all
is not good enough, Bray.

13
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,190
I want
every inhabitant of Ponyland

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,550
in the dungeons by nightfall.

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,280
I am especially interested
in the humans,

16
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:08,020
since they,
like the Troggles, have hands.

17
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,160
We need more slaves
with hands, Bray.

18
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,310
(gulps)

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,040
Hands that can serve us.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,230
<i>NOW GO!</i>

21
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,540
The baby ponies
are safe with the Moochick.

22
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,710
His magic will protect them.

23
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,290
The bad news, Megan,
is all the Seaponies

24
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,510
except Surf Rider and Water Lily
have been captured.

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,380
As far as I can ascertain,
Forget-Me-Not and I,

26
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,980
are the only two Flutter Ponies
that escaped.

27
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,760
Lots of Bushwoolies
captured too.

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,720
(All)
Yeah, yeah, lots, yeah.

29
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,350
(tremor)

30
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,980
Here you are!

31
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,760
Grundles looked all over,
I mean all under for you.

32
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,100
Are you all the
Grundles that are left?

33
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,620
'fraid so.
All others captured.

34
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,770
What are we gonna do?

35
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,000
How are we gonna stop Grogar?

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,620
Oh, cheer up everybody.

37
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,830
As long as we're free,
there's still a chance.

38
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,280
It may look
pretty dark right now,

39
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,130
but believe me,
the morning is gonna come.

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,290
Tell us what to do first, Megan.

41
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,460
Well, the first thing to do
is figure out a way

42
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,960
to break into the city
and rescue everyone.

43
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,210
Any ideas?

44
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,550
Grundles can dig the way in.

45
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,430
Yeah, great idea!

46
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,680
Let's do it!

47
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:25,060
(All)
Yeah. Yeah. Great idea.

48
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,440
Are we there yet?

49
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,370
Uh-oh!

50
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,460
(panting)

51
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,790
Took wrong turn.

52
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,470
Bushwoolies have plan too.

53
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,460
(All)
Yeah. Yeah. We have a plan.

54
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,640
Bushwoolies sneaking
out tumbleweeds.

55
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,810
(All)
Tumbleweeds, tumbleweeds,
yeah, yeah, great idea.

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,140
Charge!

57
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,000
(All)
Yeah, yeah, charge. Yeah.

58
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,820
Yeah, charge, charge,
yeah, charge.

59
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,020
Look! Tumbleweeds!

60
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,480
They are great
for target practice.

61
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,100
Retreat!

62
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,990
Troggles don't like tumbleweeds.

63
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,020
We need a plan.

64
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,420
I've got an idea.

65
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,330
Maybe one of us can sneak in
where a lot of us can't.

66
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,110
Good idea.

67
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,200
Lofty and I will try it
before it gets light.

68
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,830
Be careful, Megan.

69
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,180
Don't worry, we will.

70
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
Over there, Lofty.

71
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,560
Well, we're inside.

72
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,480
Now all we have to do
is find them.

73
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,950
That's it.

74
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,730
Now let's push it
out of the wall.

75
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,080
Looks spooky.

76
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,420
I just know it leads to freedom.

77
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,740
Galaxy, Heart Throb,
and I will explore it.

78
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,090
The rest of you, stay here.

79
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,840
Oh, this is so exciting!

80
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,240
Oh!
What a marvelous old antique!

81
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,180
I think it's more than
just an antique, Heart Throb.

82
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,010
I sense power in it.

83
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,080
Umm--do you suppose
it's the way out?

84
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,440
Only one way to learn, come on.

85
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,780
Look, there they are.

86
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,010
(Heart Throb)
Megan!

87
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,850
Oh, I must look a fright.

88
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,370
Do you have any idea

89
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,300
what a dungeon
can do to your hair?

90
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,710
Not now, Heart Throb.

91
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,590
Get the others
and we'll lead you to the gates.

92
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,980
Gee, I hope
Megan and Lofty are all right.

93
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,470
Say no more.

94
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,810
I'll reconnoiter and ascertain
what's transpiring.

95
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,890
Huh?

96
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,810
I meant I will perform
a covert surveillance

97
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,610
and report back posthaste.

98
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,650
Megan's come to show us
the way out.

99
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,320
Hurry!

100
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,910
The gate is not far from here.

101
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,220
If we time it right,

102
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,760
we can get out
when they change guards.

103
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,840
There they are.

104
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,010
Oh! No!

105
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,430
(Heart Throb)
I think we're really
going to make it,

106
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,900
I really do--
then again I could be wrong.

107
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,310
Capture them now!

108
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,650
You better make some bubbles,
quick, quick, quick.

109
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,770
Gusty, you blow them
on the Troggles.

110
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,400
Come on right now.

111
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,870
Okay. But I didn't
know this was a party.

112
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,960
I must get Grogar.
Only he can stop them.

113
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,020
Master, they're escaping.

114
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,360
The ponies and their friends
are escaping.

115
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,190
We have to stop those sentries

116
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,140
or we'll be back
in the dungeon.

117
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,570
Of course, we'll stop them.

118
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,110
Draw near!

119
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,570
I'll take that.

120
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,040
Come on, everybody, push!

121
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,680
It's working.
Give it all you've got.

122
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,570
(All scream)

123
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,730
(cackles)

124
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,440
I've got to return
and alert the others.

125
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,170
Have the Troggles return
them to the dungeon.

126
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,260
Yes, master.

127
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,840
And Bray, if it happens again,

128
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,970
you shall join them!

129
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:59,360
And then Grogar immobilized
them all with his magic.

130
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,310
That means Megan
is a prisoner now too.

131
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,230
What are we gonna do, Danny?

132
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,030
I don't know.

133
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,740
But we got to do something soon
or Grogar will rule Ponyland.
