This will teach you not
to steal my treasure!

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,630
We didn't steal it.

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,870
We spent it.

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,080
Niblick listen!

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,760
Let us go and I promise
we'll bring you back

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,880
a treasure of equal value
to the one we spent.

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,220
Interesting proposition.

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,180
She's right Mr. Niblick.

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,380
Equal value...
I promise.

20
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,980
Humph...
Did she say equal value?

21
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,220
We'll get you something better.

22
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,320
Hmm...

23
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,030
On one condition though.

24
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,360
(All)
Huh!

25
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,030
Megan, dear!

26
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,980
Have you slipped your bridle?

27
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,370
We are hardly in a
position to make demands.

28
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,570
If we bring you
another treasure,

29
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,490
do you promise to undo the
wishes of the magic coins?

30
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,160
Sounds fair.

31
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,160
Not that I care anything
about being fair.

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,500
Okay, you got it!

33
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,770
(All sigh)

34
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,400
Come on in.

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,610
Okay, here's the deal.

36
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,030
You bring me somethin' better
than my magic coins,

37
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,330
which ain't gonna be easy,
and I undo the spell.

38
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,210
Can't you undo the spell before
we find you another treasure?

39
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,540
Ponyland needs rain before
it turns into a desert.

40
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,260
I live in a desert!

41
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,760
Look you're wasting my time.

42
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,550

What do you think Niblick
would like, Puck?

63
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,620
I know.

64
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,200
I think that old troll
would like to have...

65
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,290
...The Heart of Fire.

66
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,960
What's that?

67
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,590
It's a huge ruby in the
crater of fire mountain.

68
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,310
Or he might go for the beautiful
Golden Rose

69
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,300
in the Haunted Garden.

70
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,270
Then there's always
the Emerald Idle

71
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,270
in the ruins of
the City of the Ancients.

72
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,640
Well, I guess we better split
up and try for all three.

73
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,980
That way, we're sure
to get at least one.

74
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,030
(Lofty)
Try to get a few drops on them.

75
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,280
It might keep them going.

76
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,210
We're gonna have to go
back to Paradise Estate.

77
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,210
There's no other choice.

78
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,330
But what if there's no
water there either?

79
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,220
There will be, Molly.

80
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,210
There has to be.

81
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,710
This place is full of bad luck.

82
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,980
I just know it.

83
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,720
Ah, you're imagining things,
Magic Star.

84
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,590
It's just an old garden.

85
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,430
Spike. I think
these hedge animals are alive.

86
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,320
Of course, they're alive,
Heart Throb.

87
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,820
They're plants.

88
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,820
Look!
There it is!

89
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,940
Wait a minute, Spike.

90
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,990
What if these things
are guarding the rose?

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,760
Ah, you've been listening to too
many of Paradise's stories.

92
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,250
(plants growls)

93
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,750
(gulp)

94
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,880
Then again, maybe you
got something there.

95
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,970
Darlings,
may I make a suggestion?

96
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,590
Run!

97
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,190
(Magic Star)
Run where?

98
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,050
(Heart Throb)
Do I have to think
of everything?

99
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,190
Wait a minute.

100
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,770
I said these monsters
are just plants, right?

101
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,700
Well, plants hate...
<i>fire!</i>

102
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,810
Let's go!

103
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,330
Quick thinking.

104
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,240
Niblick's gonna love it.

105
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,960
I hate it!

106
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,460
Oh, duh!

107
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,660
I mean,
Niblick, surely you jest.

108
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,810
I mean it's definitely new.

109
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,000
It smells real nice.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Here, try it.

111
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,510
You dimwitted dragon.

112
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,930
I can't--
A...A...Ah-choo!

113
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,060
As I was saying,

114
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,430
I got rose
fever for this breath.

115
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,280
I sure hope the others have
better luck than we did.

116
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,410
(Puck)
The Emerald Idol's in there,
but be careful.

117
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,240
It's guarded by a
series of traps.

118
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,710
Why does that not surprise me?

119
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,530
Oh, come on.

120
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,830
How bad can it be?

121
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,380
(Galaxy)
I'm taking no chances.

122
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,220
I'll just wink over
there and grab it.

123
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,470
(tremors)

124
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,720
(Gingerbread)
Oh! Galaxy!

125
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,970
Don't worry, we'll
get you out of there.

126
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,820
Careful! Careful!

127
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,060
The floor is booby trapped.

128
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,950
(Galaxy)
Be careful, Gingerbread.

129
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,820
Oh, don't worry.

130
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,540
I'm okay.

131
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,490
I'll have you out of there
in a jiffy, Galaxy.

132
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,040
And I'll get the idol.

133
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,090
Hurray!

134
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:04,660
I got it!

135
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,550
Yahoo!

136
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,580
(Galaxy)
No, Puck.

137
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,430
Uh-oh!

138
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,480
Puck! Get the idol outside!
I'll free Galaxy.

139
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,760
Right!

140
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,080
(Gingerbread)
I sure wish I could wink
through this thing.

141
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,820
(Galaxy)
Hurry, wink out of here!

142
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,030
(Puck)
Wow! Talk about a tight squeeze.

143
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,290
(Galaxy)
We did it.

144
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,100
We got the Emerald Idle.

145
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,590
(Gingerbread)
Let's take it back to Niblick.

146
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,060
You cracked it, mini-mind.

147
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,260
Nice try.

148
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,280
But you gotta do
better than that.

149
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,300
(Fizzy)
Once we get to the top, how
do we get the Heart of Fire?

150
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,120
(Wind Whistler)
I suggest we traverse that
overpass when we encounter it.

151
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,730
(Fizzy)
Ah!

152
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,390
(Megan)
She means

153
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,990
We should cross that
bridge when we come to it.

154
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,310
Oh, right.

155
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,040
We just came to it.

156
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,910
<i>And there isn't any bridge.</i>

157
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,630
<i>How're we ever gonna get it?</i>

158
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,420
(Megan)
<i>Can you fly over to
it Wind Whistler?</i>

159
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,290
In theory, yes.

160
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,090
In practicality,

161
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,380
the thermal updrafts from
the lava may make it difficult.

162
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,090
Still we shall see.

163
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,150
(Both)
Wind Whistler!

164
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,860
No use, I fear.

165
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,980
The air currents destroy
my equilibrium.

166
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,740
Now what do we do?

167
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,610
It's too far for me to wink to.

168
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,240
Hmm...

169
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,440
Fizzy, you can't reach it.

170
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,330
But maybe one of
your bubbles can.

171
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:57,940
Yeah.

172
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,840
They're still
real big and strong

173
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,700
because of the wish I made.

174
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,950
If you send it close enough,
perhaps we can retrieve the gem.

175
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,350
(Fizzy)
<i>Megan, the bubble is so
big, it's hard to control.</i>

176
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,930
You concentrate on flying,
Wind Whistler.

177
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,540
I'll grab the gem.

178
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,700
(Both)
Ah! Ohh! Ah!

179
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,240
Oh! Megan, Wind Whistler,
I'm so sorry.

180
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,190
That's all right, Fizzy.
We got the ruby.

181
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,070
Now we'll just fly back in.

182
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,370
Not yet.

183
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,130
The turbulence is
still too great.

184
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,650
(Both)
Oh! Ah!
