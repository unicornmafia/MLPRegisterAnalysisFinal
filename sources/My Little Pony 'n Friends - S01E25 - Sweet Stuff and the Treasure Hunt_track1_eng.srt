(Bushwoolies)
Oh, boy! this is fun. Fun, yeah!

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,130
(All)
Fun, Yeah. Yeah, yeah! Fun, fun.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,290
Gosh, that looks like fun.

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,370
Come, join us.

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Join us.

15
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,370
Ouch

16
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,800
(All)
Yeah! Ouch, ouch.

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,770
Ah, how about tag instead?

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,720
What's tag?

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,300
(Bushwoolies)
Yeah, what's tag, what's tag?
Huh! How do you play it?

20
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,280
It's easy, I'll be "it".

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,120
Everyone runs away
from whoever is "it" and...

22
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,780
Wait!

23
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,610
I didn't tell you the rules.

24
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,960
I'm supposed to tag you.

25
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,480
Was it something I said?

26
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, excuse me!

27
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,160
Aah

28
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,410
Hah!

29
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,460
Oh, gosh,
I'm terribly sorry.

30
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,670
Huh!

31
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,600
Can I help?

32
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,170
I really didn't mean
to get in your way.

33
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,060
Thank you, but NO!

34
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,180
This is not a job for amateurs!

35
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,180
If you're finished,
we could play a game.

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,810
Any game, your choice.

37
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,780
A game?

38
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,240
I've got better things to do
with my time than play games!

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,710
Hi, Fizzy.

40
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,500
(Gasps)
Ah! Oh...

41
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,700
What are you doing?

42
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,170
I've lost Ribbon...

43
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,120
...or is it Galaxy?
(Giggles)

44
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,750
Well, oh, shoot.

45
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,350
I don't even remember
where home base is.

46
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,590
You're playing hide and seek?

47
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,090
Oh, do let me play too!

48
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,720
For sure!
We'll start over.

49
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,940
Olly Olly oxen free!

50
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,720
Sweet Stuff wants to play!

51
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,390
She said she'd be "it"!

52
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,020
Huh?

53
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,700
Gosh,
I didn't say that exactly...

54
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,740
Sweet Stuff didn't
really say that, Fizzy.

55
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,370
Uh...well,
I uh, was thinking that

56
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,280
when you read
my mind Ribbon, but...

57
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,750
That's all right.
I'll be "it".

58
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,450
Okay, everybody.

59
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,330
I'll count to twenty,
and then come looking for you.

60
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:53,470
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13...

61
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,330
18, 19, 20!

62
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,840
Okay, here I come,
ready or not!

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,310
(Squirrel)
<i>Excuse me!</i>

64
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,560
Oh, no!

65
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,650
It isn't bad enough
to stand on my acorns.

66
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,140
You have to lie on them too?

67
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,190
Shhhh!

68
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,850
I'm playing a game and I...

69
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,850
A game?
You call this a game?

70
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,020
You don't understand.

71
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,850
Well, hello-oo!

72
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,250
Hi! I guess,
I'm "it" now, huh?

73
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,490
That's right!

74
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,330
18...19...20.
Okay, here I come!

75
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,580
I hear somebody.

76
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,710
Huh?

77
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,640
Huh?

78
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,710
Hmm...

79
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,210
(giggles)

80
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,990
I guess hide and seek just
isn't a game for Earth Ponies.

81
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,870
Gusty's right.
I'm not good enough.

82
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,130
Look, everybody,

83
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,590
let's make a new rule
that you can't wink in or out.

84
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,000
No, no! I don't want to spoil
the game for the rest of you.

85
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,970
(singing in harmony)
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo

86
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,060
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo

87
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,010
Wanna play with us?

88
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,260
A game?
Oh, that would be great.

89
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,330
Oh,
but I can't swim very well.

90
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,270
Oh, you can play
right where you are.

91
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,780
(giggles)

92
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,200
Go Sunshower!

93
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,680
That's it,
hit it, Water Lily.

94
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,950
Get that.
Ugh! Oof!

95
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,020
Oh, I get it now.
I'm being used as a goal post.

96
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,480
I'm sorry, but I don't
wanna play anymore.

97
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,570
Okay, these are
the lists of items to find.

98
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,440
Choose a partner,

99
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,960
and the first team to return
with the most items wins.

100
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,650
You have until sunset.

101
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,240
A purple cone, a sea shell...

102
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,120
I trust
it will not be difficult.

103
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, I know where to find that!

104
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,960
(indistinct chatter)

105
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,550
Want to join the
scavenger hunt, Sweet Stuff?

106
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,660
Well...

107
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,170
Of course you do.

108
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,810
Now who needs a partner?
Whizzer?

109
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,920
Come on,
you can be with me.

110
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,500
What is this last item, Megan?

111
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,350
Something that is one
even when it is many...

112
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,940
But that is illogical.

113
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,850
You'll know it when you see it,
and that's all I'm gonna say.

114
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,820
Next on the list
is a sea shell.

115
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,520
Let me get the shell.

116
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,110
I haven't had a chance
to find anything yet.

117
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,330
You can find it, but you're
gonna have to find it fast!

118
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll find it,
and I'll find it...first.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,580
Oh!

120
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,420
It's okay,
I've found the sea shells.

121
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,200
Now what's next?
A book with a red cover.

122
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,270
Okay, let's go back
to Paradise Estate

123
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,260
and check the library.

124
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,430
I can't keep up
with you, Whizzer.

125
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,260
You go on by yourself.

126
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,350
You go get the book then,
I'll get the next item.

127
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,770
No, I'll just hold you back.
You go on.

128
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,770
I'm sorry!

129
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,050
I'm no good at anything.

130
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,780
I think I'd just better go home.

131
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,650
(Bushwoolies)
<i>Help! Help!</i>

132
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,310
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah
help, help, help!</i>

133
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,820
How'd you get up there?

134
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,320
Bushwoolies playing tag.
Ran into Truly.

135
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,150
Yeah, yeah! Ran into Truly!
Smack into her.

136
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,500
Asked if we could help...

137
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah
help, help!

138
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,000
And she said
we could go fly a kite.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,840
Yeah, fly a kite, fly a kite!

140
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,000
Hang on, Bushwoolies!

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,380
Okay, get ready to let go
of the string.

142
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,510
No, no...there's too many of you
to catch at once.

143
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,230
Let go of the string
one by one.

144
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,400
One. By. One?

145
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,890
What's that? Huh?
Yeah, what's that?

146
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,990
Okay,
just don't go anywhere.

147
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,570
Bushwoolies
not going anywhere.

148
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,820
Yeah, nowhere,
nowhere, yeah.

149
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,740
All of you do
everything like you're one.

150
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,690
Weee Weee.
Yeah Weee.

151
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,250
Hey!
You're the treasure!

152
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,540
We're the treasure?

153
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,870
Yeah, we're the treasure!

154
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,210
Yeah, we're rich, we're rich,
we're rich, we're rich!

155
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,760
We're rich, we're rich,
we're rich, we're rich!

156
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,010
We're rich, we're rich,
we're rich, we're rich!

157
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,130
If you come with me,
we can win the treasure hunt.

158
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,550
Uh-oh! We have to hurry.
Come on.

159
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,520
(All Bushwoolies)
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Yay!

160
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,200
Well, you have the most treasure
so far--

161
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,240
everything but the last riddle.

162
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,950
Marvelous.

163
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,570
Hey, wait you come over and see
the stuff in this pile, Megan!

164
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,650
They're all real treasures.

165
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,870
Where's Sweet Stuff, Whizzer?
I thought she was your partner.

166
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,620
Ah... well, um, actually, well,

167
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,240
she thought it would be
better to separate.

168
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,540
But I bet Sweet Stuff
and I can still win.

169
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,470
If she gets back in time.

170
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,130
Oh, here she comes now.

171
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,980
And look who's with her.

172
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,470
Oh, wow! Look over there.

173
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,300
Hey, what are the Bushwoolies
doing here?

174
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,060
They're not part of the game.

175
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,310
Oh, yes they are.

176
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,560
They're the last item.

177
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,810
- I don't believe it!
- What?

178
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,060
(Wind Whistler)
Impossible.

179
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,940
Congratulations, Sweet Stuff!
You've won the game.

180
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,830
You figured out that
the bushwoolies are...

181
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,940
...Something that is one,
even when it is many.

182
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,660
(Bushwoolies)
Congratulations!
That's great! Yeah! Wonderful.

183
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,990
Dig in, everybody.

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,870
Oh, yeah. I love Ice cream!
Love ice cream, oh boy.

185
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,380
Ice cream was for eating,
not playing in.

186
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,420
We're supposed to eat ice cream?

187
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,510
Yeah. Not to eat?
Not in here?

188
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,120
Uh-oh, we're sorry.

189
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,100
Uh-oh, sorry, sorry,
didn't know! Yeah, sorry!

190
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,310
Don't worry.

191
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,470
