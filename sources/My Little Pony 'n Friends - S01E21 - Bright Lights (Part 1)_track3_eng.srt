Well,
I guess that cooled her down!

00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,550
I wasted a perfectly
good ice cream cone on you.

26
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,000
Ohhh.. lost ice cream cone..

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,970
Then we get another one
for Lickety-Split!

Oh! We come too!

I'd bring you right back.

They'll only be gone a minute.

Well.. okay,
but come right back.

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,270
Promise!

what have we here?

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,130
Ah, my fair young maidens,
how do you do?

(giggles)

37
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,430
My name is Zeb,
what might yours be?

38
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,470
(gulps)
Um, Baby Heart Throb.

39
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,090
Baby Half Note.

40
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,770
Baby Lofty.

41
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,430
Gee, are you workin' shell?

42
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,390
Not really.

43
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,230
I am Knight Shade's
personal manager.

44
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,110
(gasp excitedly)
Knight Shade?!

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,190
My my, you must be fans..!

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,710
How'd you like to meet him?

47
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,730
Would we?

48
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,580
Then, come along, my lovelies,

49
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,410
I'll take you to meet
the great star himself.

50
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,620
It's a pleasure
to meet all of you.

51
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,340
Can we come back and
see you tomorrow, Knight Shade?

52
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,160
Oh, sorry.
We're movin' on right away.

53
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,090
Aww, why you have to go?

54
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,310
Oh, ugh, tomorrow we have to
play in a village called,

55
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,680
Rosedale!

56
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,020
Ye, ye, Knight Shade!

57
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,760
Perhaps our new friends would
like a tour of the campgrounds

58
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,010
before we move on?

59
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,240
Ah, er, sorry
I can't accompany you,

60
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,980
but I've got some
business' to attend to.

61
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,910
Well,
okay Zeb, we won't take long.

62
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,270
(sighs)
We're gonna have to go
get 'em, Molly.

63
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,170
The rest of you,
wait for us here.

64
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,530
(door knocks)

65
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,700
Hi, we're looking for
three baby Ponies.

66
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,010
Have you seen them?

67
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,850
Well, yes, I have, they were
here just a little while ago.

68
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,360
I sent them home
to their mothers.

69
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,350
You did! Oh, good.

70
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,600
Thanks for your help.

71
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,630
No problem.

72
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,860
(laughs)

73
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,730
No problem at all.

74
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,620
They went back
to Paradise Estate.

75
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,870
What? Where's
my ice cream cone?

76
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,790
Never mind, Lickety-Split.

77
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,040
Come on, guys.

78
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,880
Let's go make sure the babies
got back home alright.

79
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,920
So, what do you think
of our little set-up, eh?

80
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,260
Nice, very nice!

81
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,130
Say, you three don't have any

82
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,260
musical talents yourselves,
do you?

83
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,430
Oh, I do! I wanna be
backup singer for Knight Shade.

84
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,490
(giggles)

85
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,060
No kidding.. You want to
sing backup for Knight Shade.

86
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,660
Well,
I'm very flattered.

87
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,070
And Baby Half Note sing
better than Baby Heart Throb.

88
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,170

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-tiii-tii-doo!

89
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,910
That was very nice!

90
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,510
But, wouldn't you be better off
tryin' it together?

91
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,370

in the nursery..

99

Where can they be?

100

I don't know, but here come
Heart Throb and Lofty.

We've got to tell them.

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,130
Tell us what?

103
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120

You mean you lost
them at the concert?

107
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,800
Lemme explain while
we go back to look for them.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,720
Megan, what do you think
has happened to our babies?

109
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,590
Do you think they could have
been kidnapped by Knight Shade?

00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,990
No, Lofty.

113
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,600
We'll have a better chance
of finding them

114
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,730
if we go back to Paradise Estate
and organize search parties.

115
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,500
That's right,
the Baby Ponies are missing,

116
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,110
but we're going to find them.

You've probably just had a
little too much excitement

143
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,000
for one day.

144
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,170
Oh, y-yeah, yeah, Zeb.
That's right.

145
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,690
Uh, maybe you'd all
better take a nap.

146
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,720
Don't feel so good myself.

Hello, Mr. Bert.

159

We're looking for a musician
called Knight Shade.

160
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,590
Knight Shade,
you say..

161
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,840
Knight Shade, Knight Shade..

162
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,810
Well, have you seen him?

163
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,760
Possibly, possibly..

164
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,160
Yes or no? We really
need to know where he is.

165
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,730
Well, you're
not going to find out.

166
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,650
(lever creaks)

167
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,530
(gasps)

168
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,870
(all scream)

169
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,250
Oh, how'll we
ever find our babies now?

170
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,510
Ah...what's wrong?

171
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,350
(crying)

172
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:15,340
You tricked us, stole shadows.
Not our friend made us sick!

173
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,440
Now give shadows back!

174
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,270
Baby Lofty right!

175
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,020
No, no..
Knight Shade no thief!

176
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,600
Ah, well, uh..

177
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,980
(laughs) Somebody stole your
shadows, eh?

178
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,870
That's some joke!

179
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,310
No joke! Is true!

180
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,210
You laugh, we go home.

181
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,040
Where you goin', babies?

182
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,160
(gasp)

183
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,830
(laughs)
You know, you
shouldn't be out after dark,

184
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,460
alone..

185
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,090
(laughs) Yeah.

186
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,220
Somethin' bad
might happen to ya!

187
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,260
(gasp again)

188
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,770
(sniff and cry)
