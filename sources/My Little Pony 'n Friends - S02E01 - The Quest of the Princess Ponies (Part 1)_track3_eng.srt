00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,460
(screams)

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,940
We heard a scream,
what happened?

12
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,520
My hoof! Look at my hoof!

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,850
The beautiful polish
has chipped.

14
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,950
All that fuss over
chipped hoof polish?

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,190
I gave you the ancient recipe
for polish,

16
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,440
made from glitter scent.

17
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,700
But did you use it?

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,490
Then this is your fault,
Starburst.

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,360
I did use your polish.

20
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:18,910
Some Princess Ponies don't know
as much as they think they know.

21
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,410
I know enough to be Queen.

22
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,750
It takes more than just
knowledge to be the Queen.

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,630
Right! It takes the ability to
appreciate the beauty in things,

24
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,460
which I have.

25
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,010
What?...No.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,720
To be the Queen,
a Princess Pony has to have--

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,840
A knowledge of every
part of one's domain.

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,590
That's not enough.

29
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,060
Starburst is right.

30
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,810
A Queen needs to have
a very special talent,

31
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,740
for understanding
her subjects...

32
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,230
like me.

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,330
No! no!

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,270
That is not what I was
going to say.

35
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,160
(panting)
Hi! What's going on?

36
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,940
(all)
I'm going to be the Queen.

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,040
Oh! Some shortcut.

38
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,500
We've been walking for hours.

39
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,370
Okay, let's try again.

40
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:11,500
Which way leads to Dream Valley?

41
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,600
-This way. -That way. -Yeah.
-That way. -You bet.

42
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,590
Ah! Right. Okay.

43
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,680
What was that?

44
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,960
-A light.
-It was a light.

45
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,810
-Yeah, it was. -I saw it.
-Yeah, bright.

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,930
Come on. Let's go!

47
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,120
This isn't Dream Valley.

48
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,360
-No, not Dream Valley.
-No it isn't.

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,610
-Not Dream Valley.
-No.

50
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,700
Of course,
it isn't Dream Valley.

51
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,310
What is it then?

52
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,290
And who're you?

53
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,660
This is the Royal Paradise.

54
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,540
Only royalty lives here.

55
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,040
I am Princess Royal Blue,

56
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,540
a guardian of the magic wands.

57
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,640
Really?

58
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,790
-Guardian?
-Oh, my!

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,670
-Imagine that.
-Wands? -Wands, yeah.

60
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,170
It's true.

61
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,140
We are the Princess Ponies.

62
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,260
And it is our duty to protect
the magic wands.

63
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,230
And it is your duty to come
and judge the contest.

64
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,020
-Contest?
-Oh, boy, contest!

65
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,980
-What's a contest?
-Oh boy!

66
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,230
What contest?

67
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,600
The contest to decide
who will be Queen.

68
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,100
You shall be the judge.

69
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,070
You'll probably pick me.

70
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,600
Why?

71
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,750
Because I'm the best qualified!

72
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,690
(All)
-What? You are not.
-What makes you think you are?

73
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,950
(All)
-You have some nerve! -You're so
rude! - I don't believe you.

97
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,060
I mean
you're all so good.

98
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,160
Let's let the Bushwoolies
decide.

99
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,490
(evil laugh)

100
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,030
The time has come.

101
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,260
Sludge!

102
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,340
Yes, master.

103
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,040
Prepare for attack.

104
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,880
I want those magical wands, now.

105
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,420
Yes, master, right away, master.

106
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,940
Your wish is my command, master.

107
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,680
I should be Queen.

108
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,550
No, I should.

109
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,020
Whoever heard of the Queen
with dirty hooves?

110
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,440
I can fly and you can't.

111
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,300
So I should be in charge.

112
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,400
Gee, I remember
Paradise telling us

113
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,280
the legend
of the Princess Ponies,

114
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,650
and how they guard the
magic of Ponyland.

115
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,950
I never thought they'd act
like this.

116
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,400
(All)
-Yeah, yeah, me too. -I agree.
-Never. -Yeah.

117
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,650
(tremoring)

118
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,550
(Spike gasps)
It feels like an earthquake.

119
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,870
Oh, my!

120
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,220
- What's happening?
- Oh!

121
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,170
(evil laugh)

122
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,840
It's Lavan,
ruler of the Lava Demons.

123
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,090
Run!

124
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,760
-Run. -Run. -Run.
-Run to the palace. -Run.

125
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,560
-Run!
-Hurry, run!

126
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,690
(evil laugh)

127
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,490
(both gasp)

128
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,090
I'll take these, ladies.

129
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,830
(cackles)

130
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,200
Give me your wand.

131
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,450
I'll fly out of reach.

132
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,460
Flying won't help you.

133
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,270
Ah!

134
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,050
(cackles)

135
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,350
Hey! You can't do that.

136
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,770
(laughs)

137
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,940
Is that the best you can do?

138
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,370
Yahh!

139
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,560
<i>Hey, what happened?</i>

140
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,460
<i>-Where'd he go?
-Where'd we go? -Yeah. Go.</i>

141
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,700
They're gone.

142
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,290
Our magic wands are gone.

143
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,700
If Lavan tries to use the wands,

144
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,220
he might upset the magical
foundation of Ponyland.

145
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,590
Master, I know
it's not my place to ask,

146
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,080
but what are you going to do
with the magic wands?

147
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,170
They have the ability
to transform me,

148
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:13,170
into a crystal beam
of lava's power!

149
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,740
The power to do anything.

150
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:23,730
What a wonderful thought to be
a beautiful crystal creature...

151
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,160
You are a fool, Sludge.

152
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,120
Beauty does not matter,

153
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,860
only power matters.

154
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,250
Let the transformation begin.

155
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,040
(evil laugh)

156
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,700
(yelling in pain)

157
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,220
Something's wrong.

158
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,060
(Sludge yells)

159
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,870
Gwaaaaah!

160
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,210
If Lilac would just get
her hooves up out of the dirt

161
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,040
and get on her way, we'd...Ah!

162
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,910
(tremoring)
Now what?

163
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,180
What is it, Megan?

164
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,420
I don't know.

165
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,090
Whatever it is, it's bad.

166
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,420
I can sense that.

167
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,510
Hey! What's going on?

168
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,740
(screams)

169
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,100
Fizzy, this is no time
for jokes.

170
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,100
I didn't mean it, Megan.

171
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,360
It just happened.

172
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,440
Aaahh!

173
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,330
(squishing)

174
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,360
(wind howling)

175
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,260
It was warm a second ago,
what's going on?

176
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,500
I figure that someone
or something has upset,

177
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,680
the magical powers of Ponyland.

178
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,220
Paradise! The fireworks
came from that way.

179
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,590
Right away, Megan.

180
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,940
I'll go investigate.

181
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,970
Sludge! Ready my lava board.

182
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,350
Mm-mm-my Lord?

183
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,700
The Ponies, fool.

184
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,280
I must capture
the Princess Ponies,

185
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,860
to learn how to use
the wand's magic.

186
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,560
(thud)
(groans in pain)

187
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,120
What happened?

188
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,450
What we're afraid of...

189
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,830
Ponyland's magic
is breaking down.

190
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,670
Okay, someone's
got to get Megan.

191
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,160
And it's got to be you.

192
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,730
(Lavan growls)

193
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,900
What are you doing?

194
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,060
Head for Paradise Estate,
find Megan.

195
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,930
The Bushwoolie will show you
the way.

196
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:11,430
(evil laugh)

197
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,030
You are all my prisoners.
