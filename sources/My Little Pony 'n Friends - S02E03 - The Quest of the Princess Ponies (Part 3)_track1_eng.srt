11
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,540
Don't any of the secret tunnels
lead into the dungeon?

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,790
I'm afraid not.

13
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,010
We're trapped.

14
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,710
(door creaks)

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,390
(All gasp)

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,930
Help! Run! Yeah, help, run!
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Run!

17
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,470
Sludge!

18
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,690
Ssshhh... Be quiet.

19
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,140
"Quiet?"
I'll give you quiet.

20
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,860
Come on!
Put 'em up!

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,310
- Get him, Spike, Atta' boy!
- Give him what for!

22
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,610
(All cheering)
Yeah Spike! Get him!

23
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:15,210
Wait! I only wanna--
Ouch! Help!

24
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,710
Stop!

25
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,250
Why have you come here?

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,790
To help you.

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,390
- We really believe that...
- Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, sure!

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,720
Listen! If Lavan
destroys Ponyland,

29
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,220
I will suffer along
with the rest of you.

30
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,340
I've suffered enough
at Lavan's hands.

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,140
Ice Orgs and Lava Demons
have always been enemies,

32
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,650
but...I believe you.

33
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,360
Uh...sorry about...
you know.

34
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,400
Oww! Ooh! Your hand...
It's so warm.

35
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,000
That's one reason why
Ice Orgs and Lava Demons

36
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,490
can never shake hands
and be friends.

37
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,000
Then let me
shake both your hands.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,510
We can all be friends.

39
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,000
- Thanks, Spike.
- Thanks.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,870
Now let's get out of here.

41
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,040
Let's go! Yeah! Got new friend.
Yeah! New friend, yeah.

42
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,040
What'll we do now?
The locket was our last chance.

43
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,190
We can't search anymore.
It's getting dark.

44
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,680
And I can't fly
much longer, Megan.

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,220
I'm exhausted.

46
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,800
There's one other chance,
the Moochick.

47
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,700
The Mushromp's that way.

48
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,960
(knocks door)

49
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,700
Looks like the Moochick's magic
has gone funny too.

50
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,220
Oh, my-my-my...
What? Who is it?

51
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,040
It's me, Megan.

52
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,890
Hmmm. Let me see.

53
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,960
Doh...wait! Stop!
Come back here.

54
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,930
(panting)

55
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,140
Oh... de-de-dear!
Sorry for the mess.

56
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,260
But none of my magic
seems to be working right.

57
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,180
Magic isn't working right
anywhere in Ponyland either,

58
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,060
and we've lost
the rainbow of light.

59
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,930
Oh, dear me!

60
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,020
Oh, that's very bad.
Ooh... very bad, indeed!

61
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,930
Here! Let me explain
what happened.

62
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,700
It all started when everything
in Paradise Estate went haywire,

63
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,940
and then...

64
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,240
Now!
Let it be complete.

65
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,100
(laughs)

66
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,210
Master, what has
happened to you?

67
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,010
Power!

68
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,300
That is what
has happened to me!

69
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,270
I've become the most powerful
creature in Ponyland.

(volcano erupting)

85
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,880
Okay. Follow me.

86
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,800
(trembling)

87
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,300
No time for that, Spike.
C'mon!

88
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,720
Yeah, I know. I just thought--

89
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,100
That I'd be concerned
about how I looked?

90
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,360
Well, yeah!

91
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,150
I think now we're all aware

92
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,730
that there are more
important things to worry about

93
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,310
than our looks.

94
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,610
You bet!

95
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,110
Not that your looks
aren't important.

96
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,990
- Yeah, important.
- Real important!

97
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,210
- What's important?
- That's important.

98
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,480
- Yeah, important.
- Yeah.

99
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,830
I think we've all grown up
quite a bit

100
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,410
since the start
of this adventure.

101
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,160
Of course, I also still
think I should be Queen.

102
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,040
You? Don't be foolish.

103
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,510
- I should be Queen.
- That's absurd!

104
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,800
I'm the most qualified.

105
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,880
(sighs loudly)

106
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,020
And you say Lavan stole
the magic wands?

107
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,140
Yes! Oh...
He's a horrible creature.

108
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,520
I am quite aware of just
how horrible Lavan is.

109
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,660
No wonder all the magic
in Ponyland is turning bad.

110
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,270
(growling and snarling)

111
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,940
(chewing)

112
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,270
Mr. Moochick! Mr. Moochick!

113
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,940
(grunting and groaning)

114
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,030
(muffled giggle)

115
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,280
(grunting and groaning)

116
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,160
(All scream)
Whoa! Ow!

117
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,920
(chomps and chews)

118
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,050
It's eating everything in sight.

119
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,470
Can't you stop it, Mr. Moochick?

120
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,600
I'll try.

121
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,060
<i>(All gasp)</i>

122
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,800
No! I was afraid of this.

123
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,400
My magic's not working right.

124
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,280
- What do we do?
- That's easy... run!

125
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,810
- Aha!
- Now what?

126
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,130
Well I seem to recall
something about...

127
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,320
Oh! No, no, no, no, no...

128
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,870
That wasn't it.
Hmm...

129
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,990
(whistling and signaling)

130
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,490
What's he saying?

131
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,830
I don't know.

132
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,080
Habbit, what is it?

133
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,960
(Habbit continues whistling)

134
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,890
Habbit, what are you doing?

135
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,230
He's going to feed
you to the plant?

136
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,140
(continues whistling)

137
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,420
Hmph!
He's doing no such thing.

138
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,010
He wants Megan to look
in the Book of Lost Answers.

139
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,310
(gasp)
"The Book of Lost Answers!"
That's it!

140
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,740
(All shriek)

141
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,250
- Are you all right?
- Oh... fine, fine, fine.

142
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,070
But I can't seem
to get to the book.

143
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,620
There's got to be a way
around that plant.

144
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,280
Now...what is it rabbit's up to?

145
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,950
He wants us to
go around the house.

146
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,580
Let's go.

147
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,430
(chomping and chewing)

148
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,960
"The Book of Lost Answers"!

149
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,060
But how will we get it?

150
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,300
That's easy.

151
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,310
(bells chime)
(chomps and chews)

152
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,440
(bells chime)

153
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,490
(groans)

154
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,040
What does it say?

155
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,070
Oh! This is very bad.

156
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,570
To stop Lavan,
you need your magic wands.

157
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,820
Oh, my!

158
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,870
But we don't have
the magic wands.

159
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,130
We'll get them back.

160
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,390
What do we do with
the magic wands

161
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,240
once we have them, Mr. Moochick?

162
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,060
You must seek
the heart of Ponyland.

163
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,420
But how'll we find that?

164
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,390
It says, in your heart,
you know the way,

165
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,470
and then you must
all work together.

166
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,070
No one can save Ponyland alone.

167
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,400
(angry growl and roar)

168
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,010
(Moochick)
Go now! You must hurry!

169
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,120
Are you sure this is
the throne room, Gnash?

170
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,990
Yes, I'm positive.

171
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,780
It's the throne room, all right.

172
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,910
No place else
in the world feels this mean.

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
(door creaking)

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,080
(All gasp)

175
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,350
Our magic wands...

176
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,630
What's wrong with them?

177
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,970
They've been drained.

178
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,460
Their magic is gone.

179
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,960
(Lavan)
Not gone, little pony...

180
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,610
The magic of the wands
is right here.

181
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,880
It's Lavan!

182
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,700
Run! Yeah, run, run,
run, run, run, run...

183
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,940
Run, where?

184
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,700
(Evil laugh)

185
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,040
(All scream)

186
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,610
(loud smash)

187
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,740
This is end of your quest,
my Little Ponies.

188
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,040
Yaah!
