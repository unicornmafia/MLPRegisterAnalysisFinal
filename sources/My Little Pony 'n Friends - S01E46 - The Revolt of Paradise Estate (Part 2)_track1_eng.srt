and show that furniture
who's boss.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,510
We'd only get thrown out again.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,250
Sweet Stuff, we've gotta find
that peddler and prey he knows

14
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,720
how to undo
the magic paint's effects.

15
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,710
(struggling)
Let me go.

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,590
Want baby buggy.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,110
No Baby Cuddles. It's dangerous.

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,880
You just stay with us,
understand?

19
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,870
Have to get Buggy...

20
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,870
(gasps)

21
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,370
Keep out!

22
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,960
Stay away!

23
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,050
Hang on, Buggy!
Cuddles comin'!

24
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,000
This is where we met him.

25
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,480
Well, he's long gone now.

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,400
We've gotta keep looking.

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,490
Buggy, you there?

28
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,010
Oh, Baby Cuddles.

29
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,240
Buggy!

30
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,320
<i>Hey, you!</i>

31
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,990
Come on, Buggy.

32
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,700
(All)
Get out!

33
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:04,960
Quick!

34
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,850
Phew! Safe.

35
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,960
(panting)
No painted stuff here.

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,090
But what are we gonna do now?

37
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,600
Hey, look.

38
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,100
(gasps)

39
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,800
Let me in!

40
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,370
Go away!

41
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,450
- Ah!
- I said let...me...in...

42
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,800
Face it.

43
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,540
We're looking for a piece
of hay in a needle stack.

44
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, I hate to admit it.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,560
But there's only one person
who can help us now.

46
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,130
The Moochick. To the Mushromp.

47
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,760
Go away! Stay back!

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,020
Get out!

49
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,760
Silence!

50
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,590
I say you leave.

51
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,560
(yells)

52
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,240
Perhaps then you are
beginning to understand.

53
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,360
Paradise Estate is mine!

54
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,830
Magic paint, eh?

55
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,370
Ooh, I don't-
That's a new one on me.

56
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,240
Oh, my word.

57
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,760
Hmm. I am going to have to see
this situation for myself.

58
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,840
Now let's get a look
at that home of yours.

59
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,590
<i>All our things!
Why are they so frightened?</i>

60
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,710
Work you wretches, harder!

61
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,800
It was my magic
which gave you life.

62
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,180
You are mine now!

63
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,610
I, Beezen, I'm now
master of Paradise Estate.

64
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,480
That's him.

65
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,030
The one who gave us the paint.

66
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,700
Oh, well, that explains it.

67
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,240
Beezen is a powerful sorcerer.

68
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,730
His power is in his wand.

69
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,040
Oh, he must have known of
your need for paint

70
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,910
before you even met him.

71
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,170
Hmm. This has all been part
of a carefully conceived plan

72
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,040
to steal your home.

73
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,250
Our things may have turned
against us,

74
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,390
but Paradise Estate
is still our home.

75
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,970
Then let's go get it back!

76
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:31,440
Oh, for cryin' out loud!
I was just mopped an hour ago.

77
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,310
Beezen ordered me
to mop you again.

78
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,030
Oh! This sure ain't
like the old days.

79
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,320
Oh, how I miss the Ponies.

80
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,240
They were so nice.

81
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,490

<i>Ponies!</i>

99
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,160
Keep the ponies out.

100
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,450
Hold it.

101
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,250
Beezen's probably
got every scrap of furniture

102
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,530
ready to fight us.

103
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,010
And the door
won't even let us in.

104
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,130
Then I say we break it down!

105
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,550
Charge!

106
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,210
Keep them out, I say.

107
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,600
Out! They must stay...
(yells in pain)

108
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:40,360
Listen stuff. When you
like more? now or before?

109
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,810
Before!

110
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,480
Who do you like more?
Beezen or Ponies?

111
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,200
Ponies!

112
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,320
Then let the Ponies in!

113
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,200
Whoa!

114
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,550
(loud crash)

115
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,630
Let's get Beezen.

116
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,250
You dare trifle with me?

117
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,470
(gasps in disbelief)

118
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,570
No!

119
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,100
Noooo!

120
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,180
He turned them back to normal.

121
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,490
Let's get him!

122
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,090
(Angrily muttering)

123
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,260
(both gasp)

124
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,680
I've got a plan...

125
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,560
(gasp)

126
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,770
He-he-he turned the
whole place back to normal!

127
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,780
There's nothing
to protect you now.

128
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,280
With one flick
of my magic wand

129
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,110
I can snuff
you out of existence.

130
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,630
Are you willing to risk it?

131
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,200
Very well!

132
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,880
Take back the magic paint.

133
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,750
No!

134
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,790
(wand laughs)

135
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,260
For centuries
I've been your slave, Beezen.

136
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,720
But now you're mine.

137
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,750
All mine!

138
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,970
(wand)
Now you'll learn some manners!

139
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,490
- No, please. No! - No power
is needed day and night!

140
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,980
(wand)
Working me into exhaustion?!

141
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,850
(wand)
We'll see how you like it!

142
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,350
You'll like it!

143
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,570
(All laugh)

144
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,940
This place is in worse shape
than before.

145
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,590
That's fine with me.

146
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,830
There's nothing better than
a sense of accomplishment

147
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,830
to make you feel
all good inside.

148
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,100
What Paradise?

149
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,590
I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

150
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,920
It's certainly is nice to have
everything back to normal.

151
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,100
Normal? Everything?

152
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,230
I miss Baby Buggy.
