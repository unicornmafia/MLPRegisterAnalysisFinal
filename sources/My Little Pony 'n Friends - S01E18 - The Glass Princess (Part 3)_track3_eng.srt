What the...

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,470
This is incredible!

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,710
We coulda told you that.

14
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,140
You know,

15
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,030
we'll probably
never let you leave now.

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,890
(laughs)

17
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,300
Oh, darlings!
We're trapped down here forever

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,450
unless Megan and the others
manage to find us.

19
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,650
But does anybody
even know that we are missing?

20
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,210
Well, I did drop
my sweatband

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,070
at the entrance to the cave.

22
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,530
You did?
Good thinking, Gusty.

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,300
Yeah. But who's
ever gonna find it up

24
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,070
here in the Black Mountains?

25
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,420
Oh...

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,590
This way.

27
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,310
(All gasp)

28
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,510
Oh, my dears!

29
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,090
You will complete the work
of replacing my magical cloak,

30
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,690
so my world will be filled
with my radiance,

31
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,740
my own extraordinary,

32
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,690
indescribable beauty.

33
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,910
(sneezes)

34
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,780
(mirror breaks)
(All laugh)

35
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,380
Okay, start spinning.

36
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,850
Of course,
if you stop cooperating,

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,090
you will be the first to feel

38
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,970
the glassy wrath of the great

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,960
and beautiful Porcina.

40
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,970
Whereupon
all of your little friends

41
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,860
back in Ponyland

42
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,730
will be happy to do our bidding.

43
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,980
Yeah,

44
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,620
'cause they will be
turned into glass.

45
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,470
So get to work.

46
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,290
<i>Faster, faster!</i>

47
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,300
This way.

48
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,420
(All)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

49
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,170
This way.
Oh, ooh, oh.

50
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,670
Maybe that way?

51
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that way, that way.

52
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,600
Could this be the way in?

53
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,320
Bushwoolies remember now,
this is it!

54
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,180
(All)
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
this is it, this is it!

55
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,310
Well, of course,
you probably do know the way,

56
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,270
but, well,

57
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,910
it could be more dangerous
down there than you think.

58
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,360
D-Dangerous?
Oh! no!

59
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,450
Bushwoolies don't like danger,
n-n-no sir.

60
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,920
Don't like danger?
Uh-huh-uh, no sir, no sir.

61
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,990
Okay. The Ponies and I will
lead the way. Let's go.

62
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,620
Uh!
What's the matter?

63
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,830
Let's keep out of sight.

64
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,930
Why?

65
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,300
I thought once we
caught up with them.

66
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,840
Yeah, I know. But I thought
if we keep an eye on them,

67
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,100
we'd be the back-ups.

68
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,970
Something extra
in an emergency.

69
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,310
Besides, maybe I'll get a chance
to do something special.

70
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,640
- What's that?
- I don't know.

71
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,240
Which way do we go?

72
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,400
This way.
This way exactly, this way.

73
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,060

Now we'll have everything
we waited for.

97
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,450
No more puttin' up
with this bowing and scraping.

98
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,070
Yeah!
Oh!

99
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,320
Come on,
let's go.

100
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,630
It's the Ponies!

101
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,800
Let me see.
Don't push.

102
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,670
Bushwoolies want to see too.

103
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah!

104
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,060
You found my headband!

105
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,140
Oh! Hurry
before they come back!

106
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,550
Are you guys okay?

107
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,400
Yes, but, please hurry,
so we can get out of here.

108
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,900
Don't forget
Porcina's threat.

109
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,020
What threat?

110
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,360
And who's Porcina?

111
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,260
She's the princess that all
this belongs to.

112
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,660
And she threatened to turn
Ponyland into glass!

113
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,280
I thought the Raptorians
kidnapped you.

114
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
They did.

115
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,590
But they work for Porcina.

116
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,910
How can she turn Ponyland
into glass?

117
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,620
She's a magic princess.

118
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,130
There's no way
we could stop her.

119
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,500
No!
We'll find a way to stop her.

120
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,220
I've gotta think of a way
to stop the princess.

121
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,010
Her magic is all
in her cloak,

122
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,390
and I must say it looks
much better

123
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,760
since they used
all our hair to re-weave it.

124
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,650
Oh!
The cloak is beautiful!

125
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,900
Oh,
and I'm beautiful too,

126
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,150
don't you agree?

127
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,620
A sight for sore eyes.

128
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,490
Yeah, very sore.

129
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,630
(sarcastic coughing)

130
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,570
Don't you wanna test out
the power of your new cloak?

131
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,080
Of course,
but what should I test it on?

132
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,330
Ponyland!

133
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,500
Ooh, uh-uh,
yes.

134
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,390
That could do
with some improving.

135
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,800
(magical incantation)
Kazeem! Kazaam!

136
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,060
Kazoom!

137
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,680
Kazeem! Kazaam!

138
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,110
Kazoom!

139
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,410
Kazeem! Kazaam!

140
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,110
Kazoom!

141
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,270
(All)
Oh! Noo...

142
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,390
Your work is truly
magnificent,

143
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,110
oh, omnipotent mistress.
Oh, most fair one!

144
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,200
But, would your mirrored world

145
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,690
not take on an added beauty?

146
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,990
If all the creatures in it
also reflected your loveliness?

147
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,120
Uh, why...

148
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,960
Uh--my feeling exactly.

149
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,660
Oh, dear me,
I know it's here somewhere.

150
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,170
Ah, ha! Here it is!

151
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,800
(magical incantation)
Beenasim Salaah!

152
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,670
There, it's done.

153
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:34,060
(yawning)
Oh, my... This is exhausting.

154
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,510
Go lie down
my beautiful <i>porkiness.</i>

155
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,650
Uh...uh...I-I mean my
beautiful princess.

156
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,180
You don't want to spoil
your good looks

157
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,400
on hard work like this.

158
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:46,980
Thank you, Shrock.

159
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,360
You're so kind.
So thoughtful.

160
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
Oh, boy,
she's gone.

161
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,410
Hey! I got here first.

162
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,950
Yeah,
but you sat there last time.

163
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,200
Ahem!

164
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,840
Uh, would you care to sit down?

165
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,710
It's nice and comfy.

166
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,300
We did it, boss,
we did it!

167
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,970
Ponyland is ours!

168
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,970
At last,
a kingdom to call home.

169
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,360
(wicked laughter)
