Nursery pretty, Megan.

11
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,440
Sure is, Baby Heartthrob.

12
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,400
Watch out, Baby Lofty.

13
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,610
Whooooooooaaaaaaaaaah!

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,500
(giggles)
I crashed, Megan.

15
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,780
You're not hurt, are you?

16
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,290
Not hurt, uh-uh.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,620
Not good flyer either...

18
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,790
All done, Megan.

19
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,290
Let's get cleaned up then.

20
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,630
Come on, you can all sleep
with us in the Estate.

21
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,980
(snores)

22
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,070
Ooh, cold.

23
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,570
(howls)

24
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,310
Scared too.
(gasp)

25
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,170
Baby Sundance,
Baby Lickety Split, wake up!

26
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,470
(snores)

27
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,670
Oh, what?

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,320
Ghost in the room.

29
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,680
Ghost?

30
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,890
No, not ghost.

31
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,280
Bad dream, Baby Heartthrob.
That's all.

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,350
Yeah.
Go back to sleep.

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,030
(snores)

34
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,870
Is too ghost.
I get Megan.

35
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,590
(ghost howls)

36
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,710
Aaaah!
It is a ghost.

37
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,790
(howls)

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,440
I knew
I didn't want to sleep here.

39
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,210
Wake up, wake up!

40
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,110
- Ghost!
- Ghost?

41
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,640
Go away, ghost.
Leave us alone.

42
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,470
Get out of here.
We didn't do anything.

43
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,730
(screams)

44
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,650
(howls)

45
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,060
Help!
Let me out of here.

46
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,710
Megan.

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,040
(All scream)

48
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,370
(ghost howls)

49
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,580
Eek!

50
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,170
Yikes!

51
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,960
(ghost howls)

52
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,840
(bat screeching)

53
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,720
(gasps)

54
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,430
(screams)

55
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,560
Can't scare us, ghost.

56
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,390
(screeches)

57
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,690
(gulp)
Yes you can.

58
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,180
No, it can't.

59
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,650
(bat screeching)

60
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,660
Get out, ghost.

61
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,450
(howls)

62
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,580
Go away.

63
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,520
(howls)

64
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,930
Hurry, Megan.

65
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,930
So what's so important
that you have to come

66
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,100
and get me
in the middle of the night?

67
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,970
What's going on here?

68
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,040
Ghost here.

69
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,280
A ghost?

70
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,370
Looks more like
a pillow fight to me.

71
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,070
We didn't do nothing.

72
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,950
Ghost did it.

73
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,160
All right, the fun is over.

74
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,670
So let's all settle down
and go back to bed.

75
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,210
There, now there's nobody
here but you.

76
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,980
No ghosts,
just baby ponies.

77
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,750
But there really was a ghost.

78
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,350
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

79
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,310
Now let's get some sleep.

80
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,340
Don't wanna be alone, Megan.

81
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,600
I guess you could
stay with them.

82
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,770
Yeah, stay Molly.
Please.

83
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,660
Well, okay.
But no more fooling around.

84
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,860
We be good.

85
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,030
Promise.

86
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,660
We go right to sleep.

87
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,990
The ghost still here,
I think.

88
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,190
Now, Baby Cuddles,

89
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,340
you just close your eyes
and stop worrying.

90
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,550
Believe me, there are no
such things as ghosts.

The ghost!

105
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,340
Megan!

106
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,930
Molly, what is it?

107
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,090
The ghost.

108
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,060
I saw it for sure.

109
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,430
Oh, Molly.
Not again!

110
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,020
It wasn't my imagination
or a dream.

111
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,440
It was a real ghost.

112
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,690
Yeah, just like that giant bear
in your closet

113
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,940
when you were three.

114
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,060
That was different.

115
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,640
Sure it was.
It was stuffed.

116
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,450
Tell you what,
we'll search the entire Estate,

117
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,320
and see if we find any ghost.

118
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,400
Okay?
We won't.

119
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,750
Will too.

120
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,990
Will not!

121
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,620
Will too!

122
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,340
I'm telling you,
there is no ghost.

123
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,580
Boo!
(gasps)

124
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,830
(gasps)
(laughs)

125
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,300
Spike, that was not funny.

126
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,800
It...
It wasn't?

127
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,270
Let's keep looking.

128
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,840
It's got to be
around here somewhere.

129
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,070
And when we find it,
we ask it to go away, right?

130
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,990
That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard.

131
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,240
That's not the way
you deal with ghosts.

132
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,360
You have a better idea?

133
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,120
Yeah.
If there's anything here,

134
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,360
I'm gonna catch it.

135
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,610
This ought to do it.

136
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,530
Okay, Cupcake.
Bring me the cake.

137
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,030
Ooh, looks yummy.

138
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,710
There.
All set.

139
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,960
I still don't get it.

140
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,180
It's actually
pretty simple, Spike.

141
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,050
The trapdoor is triggered
by this pulley mechanism.

142
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,640
And the cake is the bait.

143
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,880
Now I get it.

144
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,550
The ghost gets hungry,
sees the cake,

145
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,300
picks it up to eat it...

146
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,060
(thump)

147
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,230
Drat!

148
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,790
Er, would somebody
open the box please?

149
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,610
Huh, please? Could you, huh?
Would you?

150
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,900
(laughs)

151
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,330
Here,
ghosty-whosty!

152
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,710
Come out, come out.
Wherever you are.

153
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,240
Eek!

154
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,140
Oh, it's a mirror.

155
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,970
Oh, youch!

156
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,430
Eek!

157
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,020
Eek!

158
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,950
Hang it on that nail,
Masquerade.

159
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,690
I wonder what happens
if a ghost gets wet.

160
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,940
Done.

161
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,580
Well, if it a ghost,
it won't get wet.

162
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,330
Come on,
let's put one over the door!

163
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,580
Spike!

164
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,830
What?

165
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,960
I already
put one over the door.

166
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,960
Oh!

167
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,090
(birds chirping)

168
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,960
(gasp)
Yikes.

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,310
Eek.

170
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,800
Whoaaahhhh!

171
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,310
It's the ghost.

172
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,820
No, no, no, it's not.

173
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,230
Take it easy, baby ponies.

174
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,360
Oh, Megan, we're never gonna
find that mean old ghost.

175
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,040
Molly, behind you.

176
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,170
I don't believe it.
It really is...a ghost!

177
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,790
