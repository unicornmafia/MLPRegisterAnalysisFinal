11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:43,780
Gotchya now, Locket.

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,500
Oh, this is exciting!

13
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,220
Faster, Locket.

14
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,510
Oh! Oh!
Catch it, Twilight.

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,630
Oh! I just don't know
who to cheer for.

16
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,710
(chuckles)
You'll never catch me!

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,140
(All chuckle)

18
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,320
Tag, you're it!
(chuckles)

19
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:18,230
(All)
Whoa! Whoa!

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,830
What was that?

21
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,650
Some kind of huge bird, I think.

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,220
And it looked like
something was chasing it.

23
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,880
But what would dare to chase
a bird that big?

24
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,000
<i>Ooh! Come back here you!</i>

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, please, please come back!

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,250
You're my last hope!

27
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,640
Look!
Who is that?

28
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,650
Oh, all is lost!

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,510
All is lost!

30
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,590
The poor thing.

31
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,820
Oh, oh, we simply must help him.

32
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,070
Come on, girls.

33
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,910
We'd better go see what
this is all about.

34
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,350
I have a feeling
we're gonna find out...

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,610
whether we want to or not.

36
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,440
Oh, woe is me.

37
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,280
Who are you?

38
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,090
You have wings.

39
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,290
Who you are doesn't matter.

40
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,180
Come with me!
Come on let's go!

41
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,090
Don't waste time.
Come on you...

42
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,540
But where are we going?

43
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,140
And why?

44
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,680
And who are you?

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,930
My name is Garth.

46
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,430
But does it matter
to you where we're going?

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,690
You have to come!

48
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,200
It matters to us!

49
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,050
We can't help you
if we don't know the problem.

50
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,310
Right, of course.

51
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,810
Well, my problem
is that my true love

52
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,030
is in an enchanted slumber
in a floating castle

53
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,530
that I can't catch.

54
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,050
Oh! How romantic!

55
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,650
You see my problem?

56
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,420
Well, actually...no.

57
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,790
It's like this.

58
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,380
Listen, can we at least get
moving while I tell it?

59
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,880
I'm in a hurry, you know.

60
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,710
Of course, we can, darling.

61
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,260
Oh, you poor tragic thing.

62
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,500
Let's go.

63
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,920
So, why do you need us?

64
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,760
To reach the floating castle.

65
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,260
See, my true love
is named Ariel.

66
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,760
Her father was a wizard
who cast a spell

67
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,910
that put her to sleep
in a floating castle.

68
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,100
(gasps)

69
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,650
Well, come on!
We don't have all day!

70
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,530
He did this, so only the man
who is in love enough

71
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,660
to brave the dangers
of the floating castle

72
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,360
reach the chamber wherein
she sleeps, kiss and awaken her,

73
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,340
will be good enough
to marry her.

74
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,030
Listen.

75
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,460
Wouldn't we reach this floating
castle faster if we flew?

76
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,380
Well, of course, we would.

77
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,590
Will you fly with me
and tell me about...

78
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,110
about your true love
and what you would do for her?

79

(Heart Throb pants)
Is it much farther
to this castle?

97
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,870
(Garth)
It's here somewhere.

98
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,640
It moves around, so we'll have
to search a little, okay?

99
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,550
We'll find it, don't worry.

100
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,800
Won't we, Locket?

101
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,730
Locket? Locket!

102
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,570
Hey! I found something.

103
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,280
Look!

104
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,610
(gasps in amazement)

105
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,780
(Garth)
There it is!

106
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,650
(Locket)
It's certainly large.

107
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,230
How do we get in?

108
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,230
I don't know.

109
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,080
I've never been
this close before.

110
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,820
The legend says there
are challenges to be faced.

111
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,320
Well, then, let's go face them.

112
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,670
Hey! Where'd it go?

113
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,920
Did you see that?

114
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,970
I told you it moves.

115
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,310
Well, so do I.

116
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,580
(frustrated)
It's too fast for me.

117
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,770
Locket, you try.

118
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,270
It's pretty high
up, Heart Throb.

119
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,990
If anyone can go that
high, it's you, Locket.

120
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,240
You can do it.

121
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,990
(pants)
I have just got to sit down.

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,260
Come on, Twilight.

123
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:13,860
Wish me luck.

124
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,340
Go get it Locket!

125
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,540
(All)
Hurray!

126
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,800
Oh, this isn't going to work.

127
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,310
Of course, it will, somehow.

128
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,350
Not a chance.

129
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,520
Come on, Garth, cheer up!

130
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
We'll find a way in.

131
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,470
No, we won't.

132
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,190
You ponies can't fly fast
enough or high enough.

133
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,990
We can fly faster
and higher than you can.

134
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,360
Come on, everyone!
Make up now!

135
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,880
We all have to work together.

136
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,740
Work together!
That's it!

137
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,490
If we approach
from different sides,

138
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,370
one of us will be able to land.

139
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,500
Oh! That's brilliant!

140
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,390
Yeah!
We could do it like this.

141
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,380
Ready?
Go!

142
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,730
Hurray! We did it!

143
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,900
Let's go!
Move in and land!

144
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,500
(spewing)

145
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,940
(both gasp)
Ah! Whoa!

146
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,190
What was that?

147
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,780
Part of the wizard's spell,
I guess.

148
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,250
It's supposed to scare us away.

149
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,160
Well, it didn't work.

150
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,380
Hang on!

151
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,010
Let us pass.

152
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,600
(both gasp and scream)
Ah! Oh!

153
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,270
Are you all right?

154
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,550
You're soaked.

155
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,350
I'm fine.

156
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,880
Maybe we'd better look
for another way in.

157
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,860
Let me try from up here
at one of the towers.

158
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,780
Hah! This'll be easy!

159
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,570
(growls angrily)

160
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,820
Easy, did you say?

161
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,450
(growls)

162
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,420
It's hopeless.

163
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,960
We'll never get into the castle.

164
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,890
You must never say "never."

165
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,390
Remember your love.

166
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,100
She's there waiting
to be rescued.

167
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,300
Now come on!

168
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,430
We need a new plan.

169
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,010
Didn't you have some rope
in that sack of yours?

170
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,270
Yes, lots of it.

171
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,780
I thought so.
Now here's my plan.

172
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,840
(Garth)
Hurray!

173
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,180
(Garth laughs)
We've got it!

174
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,130
(All scream)
Whoa! Whoa!

175
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,960
This isn't working!

176
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,290
(All scream)

177
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,930
(screams)

178
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,130
(screams)

179
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:25,360
(All scream)
