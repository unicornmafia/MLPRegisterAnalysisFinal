Where's Surprise?
We don't want to lose her.

Boo!

00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,310
- ( Baby Cuddles squealing )
- I got ya! Ooh!

16
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,090
Surprise
frightened me!

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,900
Sorry, Baby Cuddles.

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,770
Knock off
the surprises,
Surprise.

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,530
We have to get
to Flutter Valley.

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,730
And we're already late
for the celebration...

21
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,410
I think.
Aren't we?

22
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,870
It's Cupcake's fault.
Took her forever to bake
that cake.

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,410
Perfection is not something
to be rushed, Gusty.

24
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,110
Me never been
to Flutter Valley.

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,130
You'll love it,
Baby Cuddles.

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,670
It's the most beautiful place
in all of Ponyland.

27
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,340
( gurgling )

28
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,290
Hydia:
The most beautiful
place, indeed!

29
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,390
I hate Flutter Valley!

30
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,310
( squeaking )

31
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,380
We hate it too, Mama--
I mean, Hydia.

32
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,810
And we hate
the Flutter Ponies too,
don't we, Hydia?

33
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,620
I want to ruin
the Flutter Ponies'

34
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,730
big deal celebration.

35
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:47,230
I want to make them pay
for stopping the Smooze.

36
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,560
( slurps )

37
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,790
Can't we get even
with the little ponies too?

38
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,300
They helped.

39
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,910
I have an idea,
Hydia--

40
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,460
whoa, oh-hh!

41
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,250
Let's ruin
the Flutter Ponies'
celebration.

42
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,330
I just said that,
you numbskull!

43
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,600
Now listen,
girls.

44
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,420
We're gonna
start by stopping
those little ponies

45
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,320
from getting
to that celebration.

46
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,890
- Got it?
- Got it.

47
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,770
- Then do it!
- Reeka: How?

48
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,100
- Draggle: <i>Yeah, how?
- Ow!</i>

49
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,430
Hydia:
You ask me how?

50
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,030
You're witches,
that's how!

51
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,350
We're going, Hydia.
We're leaving right now.

52
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,200
We're gone.
Bye!

53
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,950
( creaking )

54
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,620
Oh-hh, kids!
What is it with
them today?

55
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,120
They don't listen,
they don't think,

56
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,880
they have no idea
what they're doing.

57
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,470
Whoa!

58
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,190
( grunting )

59
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,770
See you later,
Hydia. Bye.

60
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,770
We'll get those ponies.
Don't worry.

61
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,390
Oh, what am I gonna do
with them?

62
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,710
- There they are.
- Yeah, let's get 'em.

63
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:20,790
And how, sister dear,
do you plan to do that?

64
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,800
Go down there
and grab them,
that's how.

65
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,170
Boy, you really
are dumb, Draggle.

66
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,640
There are too many
just to grab.

67
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,260
We've gotta be clever.
We've got to outsmart 'em.

68
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,590
You mean
we have to get help?

69
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,640
Follow me.
I have an idea.

70
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,260
Ugh!

71
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,940
( laughs )
Sorry, Reeka, dear.

72
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,770
<i>( Draggle laughing )</i>

73
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,420
It's gotta be
in here somewhere.

74
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,950
( muttering )

75
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,330
Here it is-- lasso.
I knew it.

76
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,510
Hold this.

77
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,270
( chanting )
"Cluerman, norkferm,
dand-evil, ferderkel"!

78
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,630
- You did it!
- Well, of course I did.

79
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,430
Get ready.
Here they come.

80
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,630
We should be getting close
to Flutter Valley.

81
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,720
Oh, I hope we don't
miss the celebration.

82
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,190
You're gonna miss
more than that!

83
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,810
Oh! Help!
It's the witches
from the Volcano of Gloom!

84
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,530
( cackles )

85
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,070
Run, Spike!
Get help!

86
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,790
Not so fast,
"dragon breath."

87
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,970
( gurgling )

88
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,420
Oh, my little girls!

89
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,230
Look what they've done.
It's wonderful!

90
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,720
I'm so proud of them!

91
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,560
I'm so proud!

92
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,930
I wonder where
the little ponies are.

93
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,350
They're never late.

94
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,270
Oh, I hope
nothing bad happened.

95
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,490
What could happen?
It's a beautiful day,

96
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,770
the sun is shining,
life is wonderful!

97
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,030
Down there!

98
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,950
The witches have
the little ponies.

99
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,840
Switch to utter flutter.

100
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,870
Come on, little ponies.
Move it.

101
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,620
( gasps )
It's the Flutter Ponies!

102
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,620
Draggle:
<i>I think we're in
big trouble.</i>

103
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,540
( sneezes )

104
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,550
This way.

105
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,350
( sneezing )

106
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,100
Wha-what are we
going to tell Hydia?

107
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,620
Nothing.
She'll never know.

108
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,730
What if she's watching us
in the viewing pool?

109
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,730
Draggle,
get down here.

110
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,230
What if
she finds out
we failed?

111
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,750
We haven't failed.
Not yet.

112
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,620
We're going
to Flutter Valley.

113
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,870
Follow me!

114
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,130
Agh! Ow!

115
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,550
What are you
tryin' to do?

116
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,140
Hey, watch it!

117
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,000
- Ow!
- Ooh!

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,750
( grunting )

119
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,470
The sun is the lamp
that lights our valley.

120
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,760
It gives color to our
fields and flowers,

121
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,310
and spreads
beauty and love
with its warmth.

122
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,440
Ugh! That's
the worst thing
I ever heard, Ugh!

123
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,280
Yeah, who'd
want to live

124
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,820
where it's always
warm and beautiful?

125
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,690
Well, it won't be warm
and beautiful for long.

126
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,700
Let's see what we
can do about it.

127
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,620
Can I do it
this time, Reeka?
You always do it. Please?

128
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,120
Well, all right.

129
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,620
But you
better come up
with something good!

130
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,140
- Here!
- Uh-- ooh! Oh!

131
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,210
( whines )

132
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,510
Thank you.

133
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,530

Reeka:
Will you hurry up?

156
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,930
I can't find
anything.

157
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,210
Do something simple,
like a landslide.

158
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,940
We'll bury 'em.

159
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,140
Good idea!

"Land, Land grant...
Landlord... Land mine..."

161
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,120
I found it!

162
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,990
Then make it!

163
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,610
We made some woolie pies
for you, Rosedust.

164
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,380
We hope you like 'em.
Yeah, we really do.

165
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,280
Yeah,
please like 'em.

166
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,250
And we brought you
some bush melons too.

167
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,660
- Yeah, bush melons.
- Ooh, they're good.

168
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,330
I'm sure
we'll like them,
Bushwoolies.

169
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,460
Thank you very much.

170
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,260
And here's
a chocolate cake,
Rosedust.

171
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,970
Well, it <i>was
a chocolate cake...</i>

172
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,310
- <i>( rumbling )
- What is it?</i>

173
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,900
Thunder? Drums?
Heavy dancing?

174
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,520
Spike:
It's a landslide!

175
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,900
<i>( all yelling )
Landslide, landslide!</i>

176
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,950
Run, my little ponies!

177
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,110
Fly away,
my little flutter ponies!

178
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,610
<i>Hide, Bushwoolies,
hide!</i>

179
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,700
The sun stone's
going to fall!

180
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,530
Oh, there must be
something we can do.

181
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,460
Better hurry!

182
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,040
