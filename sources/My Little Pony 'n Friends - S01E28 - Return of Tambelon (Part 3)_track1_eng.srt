Grogar's got to have
some weakness,

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,330
if only we can find it.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,920
I did notice that
whenever Grogar used his magic,

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,450
the bell around his neck
became luminescent.

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,710
Interesting!

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,180
Perhaps the bell
is the repository of his power.

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,930
Repository?

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,300
Oh, yeah, right.
What did she say?

18
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,440
She thinks the bell might be
the source of his magic.

19
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,260
Get the bell and we win.

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,980
It's worth a try.

21
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,600
But how do we do it?

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,550
I know. We'll use
your pocket tape recorder.

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,480
If we can get
Bray's voice on tape,

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,370
we can use it to lure Grogar

25
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,730
outside the city wall
and grab his bell.

26
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,610
There's just one problem.

27
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,280
I left my backpack
at Paradise Estate

28
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,130
when the Troggles took over.

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,320
No problem,
we'll just get it back.

30
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,580
(chuckles)

31
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,470
Oh, yeah!
How?

32
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,630
<i>Simple.
We'll take 'em by surprise!</i>

33
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,830
Now listen...

34
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,300
Surprise!
Hi, guys.

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,840
(shouting)

36
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,760
(shouting)

37
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,900
Hey, come on, hey.

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,930
Stop that Pony!

39
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,280
Yee-ha! Ho!

40
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,260
(Danny)
The window!

41
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,010
(Danny)
It still works.

42
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,600
What happens now?

43
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,460
Now?
Eh, now comes the hard part.

44
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,340
(Danny continuing)
They almost saw us
flying in here.

45
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,690
We've got to be careful.

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,880
I spotted Bray
when we were airborne.

47
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,780
I think he is around here.

48
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,390
There he is.

49
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,610
So you call yourselves guards?

50
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,370
This is your last chance.

51
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,080
Grogar didn't capture
all those ponies,

52
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,040
just so you can
let them escape.

53
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,620
Time to go.

54
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,220
<i>STOP THEM!</i>

55
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,400
Okay,
I've spliced the tape together.

56
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,750
Let's see how it sounds.

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,240
<i>(Bray's voice on tape)
Grogar,this is your last chance
to capture all those ponies.</i>

58
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,060
It just might work...
if Masquerade can fool Grogar.

59
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,830
Speaking of Masquerade,
where is she?

60
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,600
(Danny)
Wow! Her disguise is great.

61
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,110
<i>(Bray's voice on tape)
Grogar!</i>

62
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,200
Bray, I thought
you were at the dungeon.

63
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,830
<i>(Bray's voice on tape)
This is your last chance to
capture all those ponies.</i>

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,210
(Danny)
Okay, Masquerade, run!

65
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,000
Wait!

66
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,260
Give up, Grogar,
we've got you surrounded.

67
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,730
You're wrong boy.

68
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,440
I have got you surrounded.

69
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,140
Uh-oh! He's charging again!

70
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,620
Let me out of here.

71
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,210
(screaming)

72
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,320
Now's our chance
to get the bell.

73
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,530
Spike, wait!

74
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,330
Not bothering you, am I?

75
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,430
(groggily muttering)

76
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,820
Oh, my...might not...
I will...but glony

77
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,180
(Grogar growls)
Uh-oh!

78
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,730
(screaming)
Run everyone!

79
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,580
Run, is going to do you
no good.

80
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,330
There is no place in Ponyland
where you'll be safe.

81
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,030
Well, that wasn't
exactly a big success.

82
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,130
Evidently,
Paradise and Forget-Me-Not

83
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,370
were the only ones captured.

84
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,380
It doesn't look like
we'll ever be able to rescue

85
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,630
Megan and the rest of them.

86
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,090
I sure hope they're okay.

87
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,600
(hinges creak)

88
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,530
Do enjoy your stay, ponies.

89
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,790
(laughs)

90
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,950
Don't worry.
We'll find a way out of here.

91
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,370
Somehow, someway,
we're gonna get out of here.

<i>(Bushwoolies)
We gotta get out of here!</i>

119
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,600
I have a feeling that huge bell

120
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,690
we found in that walled-up
room is important somehow.

121
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,810
The legend mentioned
something about a giant bell,

122
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,360
but I can't remember
exactly what.

123
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,110
Don't worry,
plenty of time to think of it.

124
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,410
All right! We got one!

125
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,380
(Danny)
We may learn
something of consequence

126
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,580
by interrogating him.

127
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,970
Yeah,
and he might tell us things

128
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,800
if we ask him questions too.

129
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,670
We'll help you, if you help us.

130
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,300
What's your name?

131
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,220
I am Drog.

132
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,840
There is no need
to keep me prisoner.

133
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,590
I've deserted Tambelon.
I want to join you.

134
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,100
This better not be a trick.

135
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,180
It's no trick.

136
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,020
We Troggles
were conquered by Grogar too.

137
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,900
Some of us want to see him
defeated as badly as you do.

138
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,330
All right.

139
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,280
But you better be on the level.

140
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,700
Spike set him loose.

141
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,830
Oh! Thanks.

142
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,960
I should warn you,

143
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,720
Grogar plans to exile the ponies
he's already captured

144
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,540
to the Realm of Darkness
at midnight tonight.

145
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,390
We've got to do something.

146
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,760
I know a secret way
into the city.

147
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,030
I'll lead you in.

148
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,880
I guess we'll have
to trust you, Drog.

149
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,060
Get ready, everybody.

150
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,030
We are going to rescue
Megan and the others.

151
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,740
Nigh!

152
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,130
Here.

153
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,050
Gosh!
No way am I going down there.

154
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,550
It's dark!

155
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,720
Well, not to worry!

156
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,220
I'll light things up.

157
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:41,010
All is in readiness master,
as you ordered.

158
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,400
Good!

159
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,730
Very soon now there will be
no more ponies in Ponyland.

160
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,690
These steps will lead us
to the dungeons.

161
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,040
Even a dungeon will look nice
compared to this.

162
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,540
It's safe.

163
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,050
(indistinct shouting)

164
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,170
You lied to us.

165
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,470
You betrayed us.

166
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,130
Well, welcome My Little Ponies,

167
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,430
what a pity
you can't stay for long,

168
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,400
for in a few short hours,
you with the rest of your kind

169
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,360
will be banished
to the Realm of Darkness.
