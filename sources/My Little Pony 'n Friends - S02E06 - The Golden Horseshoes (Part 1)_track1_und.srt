Gee Sweet Stuff,
I saw Mimic going this way.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,290
She should be...

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,550
(gasps)

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,450
There she is!

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,460
Mimic! Mimic!

15
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,620
Where'd she go?

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:51,940
Mimic, What's the matter?

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,060
I...I don't know...

18
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,770
Sweet Stuff,
what are we going to do?

19
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,300
Mimic's so weak, it's scary!

20
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,450
When North Star brings Megan,
she'll help Mimic get well.

21
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,290
There they are.

22
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,660
Sweet Stuff, Surprise,

23
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,450
How's Mimic?

24
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,700
Let's hurry inside.

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,070
Aww, is that
more comfortable Mimic?

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,550
Thank you, Cupcake.

27
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,310
Hello, Mimic
how are you feeling?

28
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,470
(Spike)
The twinkle is gone
from her eys.

29
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,500
She's lost her appetite.

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,000
She hasn't eaten
anything in three days.

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,140
No cough, no fever,

32
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,590
her tongue isn't coated,
and her throat isn't red,

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,850
she's awfully pale.

34
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,110
But I don't know what's wrong?

35
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,310
Neither do we.

36
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,360
It's not like any illness
we've ever had.

37
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,520
Could...could it be magic?

38
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,320
Magic, that's it!

39
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,940
When magic's involved,
the Moochick is the one to see.

40
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,490
I'll take you to him, Megan.

41
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,840
Let's go.

42
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,160
Just a minute, Megan,
I'm coming with you.

43
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,430
- Me too.
- We'll all go with you, Megan.

44
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,670
I'm coming too.

45
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,920
Hop on Spike.

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,840
We'll be back soon Mimic.
Hold on!

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,760
Hurry back!

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,630
And good luck.

49
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,380
<i>(wolves howling)</i>

50
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,800
<i>(howling continues)
There, all safe and sound.</i>

51
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,020
Gee Thanks.

52
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,100
<i>(wolves howling and barking)
Wolves!</i>

53
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,050
Run for the Moochick's cottage.

54
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,470
I've done it, Habbit.

55
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,650
Help! Open up!

56
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,620
Whoever you are,

57
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,230
go away, go away.
I'm busy.

58
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,570
<i>(wolves howling and barking)</i>

59
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,240
(gasps)
Nduh! No.

60
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,540
I'm sorry.
But this is an emergency.

61
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,370
Wolves were after us.

62
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,470
(giggles)
Oh! Ha, ha, hah.

63
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,290
No, no, no, no, no!

64
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,800
That was my wolf box.
<i>(barking sound from the box)</i>

65
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,560
Oh! But it was supposed
to scare you away, oh!

66
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,080
Ummm...Mr. Moochick,

67
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,310
Mimic is sick
and we think it's due to magic.

68
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,560
Uh-ah, what?

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,850
She's lost her twinkle.

70
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,090
Can ya help her?

71
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,430
Hmmm...

72
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,400
Well, I'm sure I have something
about sick unicorns

73
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,980
in a book somewhere.

74
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,270
(snaps)

75
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,230
Aha! Yes this book
is the very one.

76
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,530
"Pony Legends and History."

77
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,400
(clear throat)

78
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,780
"The Legend of
the Four Golden Horseshoes."

79
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,670
Yes, of course!

80
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,200
Ah! Mimic is descended
from this unicorn.

81
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,330
<i>"Long ago, in the land of
Argyte,</i>

82
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,850
<i>four horseshoes were made
of mystical starlight."</i>

83
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,090
Yes, oh.

84
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,840
<i>"They were placed on the
hooves of this special unicorn.</i>

85
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,960
<i>Now, each shoe gave her
a magical power."</i>

86
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,760
My, my, my!

87
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,610
<i>"The first showed the future,</i>

88
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,720
<i>"the second had
the power of blazing light,</i>

89
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,600
<i>"the third made
another's thoughts</i>

90
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,480
<i>"sound clear and loud,</i>

91
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,860
<i>and the fourth let its wearer
float like a cloud."</i>

92
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,480
(neighs)

93
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,070
<i>"Deep in dream valley,
the wind left her at dawn</i>

94
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:09,070
<i>And there she did stay,
for her horseshoes were gone."</i>

95
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,330
That's all fascinating,
Mr. Moochick.

96
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,220
But what does it have to do
with Mimic's illness?

97
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,460
Well, my, my.

98
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,880
Mimic is a direct descendent
of that unicorn.

99
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,800
And the magic of the shoes
still flows in her veins.

100
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,720
Over the years,
the Golden Horseshoes

101
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,250
have been carried
farther and farther apart.

102
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,020
And because of that,
their magic is weakening.

103
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,840
That's why Mimic
is getting weaker.

104
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,160
Where do we find the Horseshoes?

105
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,600
In the Land of Screera.

106
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,600
It's said that the Scree gaze
upon one to see what will be.

107
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,170
Okay, we're going to Screera.

108
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,660
Now, while you hunt for
the Horseshoes,

109
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,780
Habbit and I will
look after poor Mimic.

110
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,610
Won't we Habbit?

111
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,930
Here child.

112
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,200
This might prove
of better use to you than me.

113
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,550
Oh now! Dear, dear, dear...
Well, let's see.

114
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,680
I was about to turn
yellow into blue, uh, I think.

115
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,550
Oh! Of course, poor Mimic!

116
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,430
Come along, Habbit!

It's over there! That's Screera.

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,500
If this is Screera, North Star,

137
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,290
where are the Scree?

138
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,000
They're all around us.

139
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,270
(cackles)

140
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,010
I'd bet five-to-one
you'd come back, North Star.

141
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,460
I want you all
to meet Fleetfoot,

142
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,360
leader of the Scree.

143
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,350
And watcher
of the Crescent of Visions.

144
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,470
That was how I could
predict North Star's return.

145
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,360
Isn't that cheating?

146
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,480
Screes only bet on sure things.

147
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,230
But the Crescent of Visions did
not show why you returned.

148
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,380
It's like this...

149
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,870
You see, Mimic,
one of the ponies...

150
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,210
The Crescent fell from the sky,
it was a gift to the Scree.

151
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,070
We cannot part with it.

152
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,640
That's the horseshoe,
but what can we do?

153
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,460
Shhh...I have an idea.

154
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,090
Fleetfoot, I challenge
you to a race.

155
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,980
The winner gets the Crescent.

156
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,470
On one condition!

157
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:13,590
If you lose, you become
my servant forever!

158
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,090
Done.

159
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,860
Oh, poor Wind Whistler,
she looks so embarrassed.

160
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,740
- Come on! Wind Whistler!
- You can do it!

161
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,600
(All cheer)

162
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,120
Oh, no!

163
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,410
Oh! Wind Whistler.

164
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,950
(laughs)

165
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,000
The Crescent never lies.

166
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,430
It foretold
that Fleetfoot would win.

167
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,460
(cackles)
Of course, we Scree,
only bet on sure things.

168
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,710
Silly ponies!

169
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,850
(both laugh)

170
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,300
So that's what's going on.

171
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,550
But they won't get
away with it.

172
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,200
<i>(wolves howling)
Wolves scream...</i>

173
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,390
My head's goin' in!

174
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,860
<i>(howling continues)</i>

175
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,450
Megan,
what are you doing?

176
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,700
They cheated.

177
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,950
They knew Fleetfoot would win.

178
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,820
And we need it for Mimic's sake.

179
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,080
I say...
These ninnies don't play fair.

180
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,040
It's worth a try.

181
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,580
Horseshoe of Visions,
where is the Horseshoe of Light?

182
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,080
That's Blarkland!

183
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,970
I've been there.

184
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,800
Great! Show us the way.

185
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,590
So you want the Horseshoe
to save your friend, correct?

186
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,180
We Blarks collect, keep,
and trade junk and riddles.

187
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,430
You have no junk.

188
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,930
So, tell me a riddle
I don't know,

189
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,760
and the Horseshoe is yours.

190
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,740
Thank you.
That's very generous.

191
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,910
Uh...why did the boy threw
the alarm clock out the window?

192
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,280
Because he wanted
to see time fly.

193
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,040
Tell me one I don't know!

194
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,530
I have a riddle.

195
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,410
What walks on four legs
in the morning,

196
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,540
two at mid day,
and three at sunset?

197
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,340
Uh...a three-toed bullfrog?

198
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,430
No...uh,
a dragon with gooseflesh?

199
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,510
Um-uh, a gyrating galumpadillo?

200
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,840
I guess not...

201
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,100
I give up!

202
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,350
What?!

203
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,060
Humans, like Megan.

204
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,930
They crawl as babies,

205
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,190
they walk as adults,

206
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,610
and they use a cane
for a third foot

207
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,560
when they grow very old.

208
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,900
(laughs)
Very good!

209
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,390
Cracker, take them
to the Horseshoe.

210
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,160
It's here, umm...
somewhere.

211
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,650
We'll never find it in all this.

212
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,530
Everyone listen!

213
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,130
This horseshoe
has the power of light,

214
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,370
so that's what we look for.

215
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,490
You mean like
the one by Cracker's foot?

216
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,620
I'll get it out!

217
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,540
Uh-oh!

218
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,840
Look out!

219
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,470
You saved Cracker.

220
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:57,250
So I order a hole to be dug
to the Goblin tunnels.

221
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,770
There you will find
another Horseshoe,

222
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,890
stolen a long time ago
from the Blarks.

223
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,900
Thank you for your help.

224
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,240
No problem.

225
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,350
You are all the Blarks' friends.

226
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,850
Megan, look!

227
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,740
The Horseshoe is growing
brighter.

228
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,600
We must be nearing
the third one.

229
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,990
Now, what have we here?

230
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,110
Won't Ma be surprised?

231
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,500
(murmuring)
