11
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,380
(laughs)
They'll never survive this.

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,180
What is this?

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,520
It's a land pie.

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,680
Wh-What?
What's a land pie?

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,310
It's was...it's a...
Well...oh,

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,860
you told me to make it.

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,650
I told you to make a <i>landslide,</i>

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,280
not a <i>land-pie.</i>

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,120
Ugh!

20
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,990
(laughs)
Ew...

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,790
You've ruined everything.

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,750
Let's get out of here.

23
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,450
(cheers)

24
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,780
The landslide has stopped.

25
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,680
The witches are leaving.

26
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,920
It's safe now.

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,960
- Yeah, it's safe.
- No more landslide.

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,290
Yeah, nothing to worry about.

29
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,540
Phew.

30
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,600
That was a close call, Rosedust.

31
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,520
Too close if you ask me.

32
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,640
I think we ought to do something
about those witches.

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,980
- Yeah.
- Do something.

34
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,350
Get those witches.

35
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,550
No, they didn't really
mean to harm us.

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,900
- Correct.
- No revenge.

37
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,110
Revenge stinks.

38
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,110
Morning Glory,
Honeysuckle, please don't argue.

39
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,230
The important thing is that
we're all safe now.

40
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,400
But Morning Glory is wrong.

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,980
We can't let others
just run over us.

42
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,240
No, Honeysuckle.

43
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,800
It's better to
just turn the other wing.

44
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,660
Fighting isn't necessary.

45
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,620
But one thing is necessary,
Flutter Ponies.

46
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,750
We have to be getting back to
Paradise Estate now.

47
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,590
I wish we could go with you

48
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,800
because we don't want
to go home alone.

49
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,670
- No, no. Not alone.
- Oh, no way, no way.

50
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,920
Of Bushwoolies.an,

51
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,640
Thank you for coming,
little ponies.

52
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,890
Goodbye, Spike.

53
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,140
Goodbye, Bushwoolies.

54
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,390
Goodbye! So long!

55
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,640
See you soon.
Bye!

56
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,160
Be careful.
Watch out for the witches.

57
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,810
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

58
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,700
It wasn't my fault.

59
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,190
Draggle did the magic.

60
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,160
It was Reeka's idea.

61
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,910
I just did
what she told me to do.

62
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,040
I don't understand it.

63
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,290
I've done everything

64
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,430
a mother could do
to make you low

65
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,920
and miserable and wretched.

66
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,440
Forget evil and mean,

67
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,510
give me something.

68
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,810
Could we please stop eating
these doughnuts, Mama?

69
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,300
No you can't,

70
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,720
and don't call me Mama.

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,640
Ouch! Agh!

72
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,970
Now come with me.

73
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,990
We'll have a family meeting.

74
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,200
I'll get even with
those Flutter Ponies

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,650

(whispers)

89
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,360
Get Bumble and her bees

90
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,520
to steal the Sunstone
from the Flutter Ponies.

91
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,990
But what good would that do?

92
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,110
What do you mean,

93
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,860
"What good would that do?"

94
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,030
It would... It would...

95
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,710
What good would it do?

96
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,870
(whispers)

97
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,120
Oh!

98
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,000
The Flutter Ponies would chase

99
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,850
after their precious Sunstone,

100
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,590
and the bees would capture them.

101
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,210
See?

102
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,340
But Bumble and the bees
would get the Sunstone

103
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,220
and the Flutter Ponies.

104
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,270
What would we get,
Mama?

105
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,130
Oh, Hydia...I mean Hydia!

106
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,610
What would we get?

107
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,780
What would we get? We'd get...

108
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,610
What would we get?

109
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,110
(whispers)

110
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,610
We'll get Flutter Valley.

111
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,200
But there's all those flowers
and sweetness.

112
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,980
Yeah, yuck!

113
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,790
(whispers)

114
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,300
Flutter Valley will become dark,

115
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,370
dank and dreary
without the Sunstone.

116
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,300
Really disgusting!

117
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,160

I forgot Bumbleland was so
co-cold.

129
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,620
That's why Bumble and
her bees are so mean and tough.

130
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,240
They're-
They're probably freezing.

131
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,840
They were mean and tough before.

132
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,280
That's why they got
kicked out of Flutter Valley.

133
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,680
Oh, look.
Red clover -

134
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,540
Bumble's favorite plant.

135
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,510
Maybe we should bring her
a present.

136
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,460
Good idea, Draggle.

137
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,790
Go get it.

138
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,890
What if I slip off the tree?

139
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,800
Stop being so afraid.

140
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,630
I'll be down here waiting.
Go on!

141
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,280
All right...

142
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,940
Whoaaaaaaah!

143
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,640
(laughs)

144
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,640
Ouch!

145
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,040
You were wrong, sister dear.

146
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,900
Now you get it.

147
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,980
Aww...aww! Uuh!

148
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:01,410
Aww...aww!

149
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,820
See how easy that was?

150
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,840
It's Bumble's swarm.

151
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:12,920
Agh!

152
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,810
Not so fast.

153
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,670
- Where are our seatbelts?
- I am not used to it.

154
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,800
(slurps)

155
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,900
One step closer and
I'll stick you.

156
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,240
Wait.
We come as friends.

157
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,930
We ain't got no friends.

158
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,150
We brought a present for Bumble.

159
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,820
(slurps)

160
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,320
What's going on here?

161
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,450
Can't you see I'm eating?

162
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,960
(slurps)

163
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,000
We're Reeka and Draggle.

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,080
The witches from
the Volcano of Gloom.

165
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,880
We have a proposition for you.

166
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,010
What is this
about a proposition?

167
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,540
Well, we thought
you might be interested

168
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,690
in a little plan
that would turn Bumbleland

169
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,930
into a warm place

170
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,050
filled with lots of flowers.

171
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,800
But nothing grows here.

172
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,400
I have to import everything.

173
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,470
But that's the whole idea.

174
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,450
With our help
you can get the Sunstone

175
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,700
from Flutter Valley,

176
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,820
and grow
all the flowers you need.

177
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,490
The Sunstone?

178
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,410
Flutter Valley?

179
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,320
The Flutter Ponies?

180
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,410
<i>I hate Flutter Ponies!</i>

181
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,880
So you like the idea?

182
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,330
I think it's simply marvelous.

183
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,580
But what do you get out of it?

184
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,220
We get Flutter Valley.
(laughs)

185
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,300
But it will become so ugly
without the Sunstone.

186
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,180
That's exactly how we like it.

187
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,430
Do we have a deal?

188
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,990
I'll do it.

189
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,110
Spike, what are you doing?

190
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,990
I'm on a witch watch.

191
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,770
What's a witch watch?

192
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,950
I'm watching for witches.

193
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,160
You never know
when they might attack.

194
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,950
But Morning Glory said
there's nothing to worry about.

195
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,780
Better safe than sorry.

196
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,090
Beware, little ponies.

197
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,180
Strange looking creatures
up ahead.

198
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,590
Follow me,
and be quiet.

199
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,960
Shh!

200
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,520
What are they?

201
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,630
I've never seen
anything like them before.

202
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,130
(arguing voices)

203
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,140
They're Furbobs.

204
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,190
Our first cousins.

205
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,470
Furbobs.
It's us, the Bushwoolies.

206
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,650
Yeah, Bushwoolies.

207
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,310
Your first cousins, Bushwoolies.
Relatives.

208
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,480
Cousin Bushwoolies, hi!

209
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,810
I'm Hugster.

210
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,410
I'm Charmster.
Charmed, I'm sure.

211
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,870
I'm Wishful.
I wish you remember us.

212
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,480
And we're little ponies.

213
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,750
Except me.
I'm Spike, a baby dragon.

214
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,820
Where are you going,
cousin Furbobs?

215
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,170
We're going home.

216
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,630
No we aren't.
We're picking berries.

217
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,960
The Furbobs never agree
on anything.

218
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,590
No, never. Nothing.

219
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,830
I wish they would.

220
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,730
Where do you live, Furbobs?

221
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,970
- Up there.
- Down that way.

222
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,220
- Across that way.
- Over there.

223
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,470
In the woods.

224
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,340
Actually we've moved
so many times in the last year

225
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,230
we don't remember.

226
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,760
Why? What's the problem?

227
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,850
The Stonebacks!

228
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,480
- They agreed.
- They said the same thing.

229
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,740
They didn't argue.

230
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,080
Who are the Stonebacks?

231
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,270
Our mortal enemies.

232
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,320
They chase us
from every place we live.

233
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,540
What do these Stonebacks
look like?

234
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,660
Like that!

235
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,340
(snorting)

236
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,120
We're trapped.

237
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,300
(snorting)

238
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,840
Help! Save us! Please help!
