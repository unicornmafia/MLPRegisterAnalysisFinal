I say it's a lovely day
for exploring, eh, Lofty?

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,680
If you happen to
like exploring solid rock.

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,590
Oh, don't be so dreary!

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,460
No one's ever been here before.

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,590
We are sure to find something
terribly exciting.

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,850
Like that!

16
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,970
(mysterious music)

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,690
It says, "keep out."

18
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,190
Well, they couldn't mean us,
Paradise.

19
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,440
Where could it lead, I wonder?

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,190
Wait!

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,990
What if there's something
dangerous behind that door?

22
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,110
Think, North Star,
before you do anything rash.

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,490
Very well, very well!

24
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,130
Oh, drat! Let's have a
go at it, shall we?

25
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,240
North Star, please!

26
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,420
This could be the Golden Door!

27
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,230
A long long time ago,

28
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,170
the most fearsome creature
ever known terrorized Ponyland.

29
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,920
<i>So, a sorcerer forged
the Golden Door.</i>

30
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,440
<i>A gateway to
the Land of Legends.</i>

31
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,930
<i>A mysterious door of realm.</i>

32
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,900
<i>And it was
through that golden door</i>

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,150
<i>that the beast was pushed
into the land of legends.</i>

34
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,280
<i>As long as no one passes
through the door,</i>

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,170
<i>the beast will remain there.</i>

36
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,160
So reign in that curiosity
of yours North Star.

37
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,610
And stay away from that door!

38
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,290
Now, if you'll excuse me.

39
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,870
I've had enough
exploring for one day.

40
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,120
A brightfully silly story.

41
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,670
I fancy she simply made it up.

42
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,440
North Star!

43
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,180
How could anything dangerous
be behind such a lovely door?

44
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,800
In any event, Paradise
didn't say not to open it.

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,300
She merely said not to pass
through it.

46
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,200
North Star, don't!

47
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,110
Oh, how dreary!

48
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,370
Well, that certainly
was a disappointment.

49
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,490
Ohh!

50
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,820
Stand and deliver!

51
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,500
Oh, no!

52
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,740
Hold steeds.

53
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,800
What manner of pony are these?

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,580
Aye, who'd be your master?

55
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,350
Does he have any money?

56
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,420
We...we have
no master or money.

57
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,240
No money?

58
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:12,230
(All cry)

59
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,490
Allow me to introduce myself.

60
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,400
I am Hood, Robin Hood.

61
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,030
And these are my..eh..huh,
merry men.

62
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,040
Merry men?

63
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,280
We are North Star and Lofty.

64
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,160
Welcome to Ponyland!

65
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,370
Ponyland, eh?

66
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,630
Jolly good!

67
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,620
They have a holiday here,
it would make my Merry Men,

68
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,450
a bit more merry.

69
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,550
I say everyone-

70
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,510
come out
and have a look.

71
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,600
Ahhh!
This is nice.

72
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,050
There's quite a few of you.

73
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,020
You are not all Merry Men.

74
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,270
(Laughs)
No, no.

75
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,350
We're legends and myths.

76
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,650
There's Paul Bunyan
and Big, his ox.

77
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,230
And Aladdin and his lamp.

78
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,060
And Chaharazad.

79
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,570
And there's Hercules.

80
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,230
Uh..Haa! Uhh!

81
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,410
It's coming!
<i>(aligatorsaur roar)</i>

82
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,800
(All gasp)

83
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,960
It's coming after us!

84
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,990
Close it!

85
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,410
Hurry!

86
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,740
Shut the door!

87
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,420
(All sigh)

88
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,130
I say,

89
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,080
what was all that about?

90
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,050
No...no, it's too horrible.

91
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,630
That creature
Paradise mentioned.

92
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,100
Could that be
what they're so afraid of,

93
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,560
that they all have
come to Ponyland?

94
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,730
Quite.

95
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,480
Hmm, I guess
we should let everyone know.

96
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,280
(tremoring)

97
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,270
Ohhh...

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,870
Oh darling, Paradise!

99
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,360
Such a lovely bouquet.

100
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,210
I would give
it to my true love,

101
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,780
but, where is he?

102
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,380
Will he never come
into my life?

103
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,120
Oh, Heart Throb, don't be
discouraged.

104
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,020
Your true love will show up.

105
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,510
He's out there,
I'm sure of it.

Ah, who...who are you?

126
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,790
Well, Prince Charming of course.

127
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,110
And I've been searching
my whole life through

128
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,350
for you, my sweet.

129
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,430
You have?

130
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,030
Promise me
we'll be together always?

131
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,190
Darling, you needn't even ask.

132
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,310
Huh?

133
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,480
Dearest!

134
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,560
Oh, how I've longed
to find one so fair as you.

135
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,630
But, but what about Heart Throb?

136
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,570
Forget the past!

137
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,540
Think only of the present.

138
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,660
Us, together.
Now and always.

139
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,790
Ohh, my one true love.

140
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,410
Oh, my sweet!
How can you pass me by?

141
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,250
True Heart, it's you I love!

142
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,140
Darling, Don't go.

143
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,930
I've got a funny
feeling about this.

144
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,930
(groaning)
Rrrraaaahhh!

145
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,670
There! I just love a
tidy place, don't you?

146
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,440
Oh, yes, Hercules,
so do we!

147
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,540
I haven't had so much fun

148
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,000
since I cleaned
the Agean's stables

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,870
Filthy dirt. filthy,
filthy, filthy...

150
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,350
Just like
a willow in the breeze.

151
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,100
(All giggle)

152
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,380
That's it my little ones.

153
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,780
And that's how we do the dance
of the seven waves.

154
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,740
Gee-Wiz!

155
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,310
It's a wonderful day
for a picnic, Lickety-Split.

156
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,580
It truly is.

157
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,490
Those clouds have me worried
Buttons--

158
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,710
'Cause it looks like
it's gonna rain, and I might

159
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,410
What's that?

160
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,660
It's a lamp that
Aladdin fellow traded to me.

161
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,540
It should clean right up.

162
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,590
I think he tricked you,
Buttons,

163
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,080
there's no place
to put a light bulb.

164
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,640
(both gasp in amazement)

165
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,420
I am the Genie of the Lamp

166
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,390
and I'm obliged to grant
you three wishes.

167
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,670
May I take your order, please?

168
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,270
You go first, Lickety-Split.

169
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,760
I wish the weather was perfect.

170
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,410
Perfect! Hmm..

171
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,820
Could you be more specific?
Temperature?

172
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,270
Well...

173
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,410
Eighty two, sixty four,
a hundred and seventy nine?

174
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,610
Uh, eighty two?

175
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,740
Relative humidity?

176
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,120
C'mon c'mon! What'll it be?
Five percent, ten, ninety?

177
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,210
Whub-ah,
I haven't thought of it.

178
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,120
And I'll also need to know
the prevailing wind speed

179
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,250
and the percentage of
the color orange in the sunset.

180
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,520
Look all I want
is a perfect day,

181
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,010
So what's so difficult
about that?

182
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,460
And what about the sky?

183
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,680
You have your cerulean blue,
your robin's egg blue,

184
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,470
your royal blue or
blueberry blue, cobalt blue?

185
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,230
(Lofty)
Well, North Star,

186
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,780
I hope you're satisfied
opening that door.

187
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,360
We're practically being crowded
out of the estate

188
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,910
by uninvited guests.

189
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,790
Shame on you!

190
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,040
Come, come, Lofty!

191
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,910
'Tisn't that bad.

192
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,540
No?

193
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,740
What about the legend?

194
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,710
If anyone passes
through that door?

195
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,250
Everyone came through the
door already.

196
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,000
And we shut it behind us,
there was no monster.

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,380
Monster?

198
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,480
(panicked shouts)

199
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,140
We don't
have to worry.

200
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,890
Oh?
Then why are they so nervous?

201
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,020
(Heart Throb)
Prince Charming, darling?

202
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,940
How romantic?

203
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,770
(roars)

204
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,450
(roars)
