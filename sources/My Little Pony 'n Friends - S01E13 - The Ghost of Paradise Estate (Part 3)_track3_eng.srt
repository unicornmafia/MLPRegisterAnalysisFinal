What's Pluma doing?

11
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,030
I found it!

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,770
But you destroyed
Paradise Estate.

13
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,320
I had to destroy the estate
to get to the amulet.

14
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,700
If I don't give this to Squirk,

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,070
I'll never see
my grandfather again - ever!

16
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,290
Oh yeah?
Well, what about us?

17
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,460
Please try to understand.

18
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,540
Perhaps I can restore
it with this.

19
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,670
Now, let's see...

20
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,160
I mean, it's a matter
of thinking about...

21
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,340
what you...
Uh, that is to say...

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,310
You mean the Flashstone will do
whatever he or she wills?

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,420
Oh, exactly!

24
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,770
Then do it.

25
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,730
Oh, sounds like
it's working!

26
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,360
Huh? Well,
that sure looks weird.

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,030
I'm sorry.
But it's the best I can do

28
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,370
without the other half
of the amulet.

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,990
(sobs)
Our home no good.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,510
Still can't live there.

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,370
Shh, Baby Heart Throb.
We'll get it fixed somehow.

32
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,090
Do you know where the
other half of the amulet is?

33
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,460
No. But with this half,
the other half can be found.

34
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,930
Uh... I think that's
what grandfather said.

35
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,540
Then let's
look for it together.

36
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,060
No, no, no!
We don't have time.

37
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,970
I have to get this to
Squirk right away.

38
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,770
There must be something
we can do.

39
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,850
Buttons, Fizzy, come on!
I've got an idea.

40
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,780
So, how's your
ancient feathered friend?

41
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,150
Oh, so help me, Squirk.

42
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,900
If I ever get out of here,
by cracky,

43
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,880
I...I... Oh...Oh...

44
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,720
Give it up, grandpa!
Your powers are gone.

45
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,830
(Crank)
Oh look it, Squirk. He's trying
to change shape to escape.

46
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,430
Oh, relax!

47
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,220
He's so old
he can't even change his mind.

48
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,690
(laughs)
Hey-ho!
That's a good one, Squirk!

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,180
(laughs)
A real good one...

50
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:54,810
Shut up!

51
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,750
So where is this Squirk?

52
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,240
What if he doesn't
see Pluma's signal?

53
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,040
Oh, I'm sure he will!

54
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,360
All this water
makes me nervous.

55
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,380
Dragons don't swim
very well, you know.

56
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,120
But I've never tried to
make such big bubbles, Megan.

57
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,870
You can do it, Fizzy.
Go for it.

58
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,690
Wow!

59
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,550
Wow, this is neat!

60
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,070
Terrific, Fizzy!
Now make one for Danny.

61
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,700
Now we may need some help
getting down there.

62
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,370
What's that, Megan?

63
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,870
It's the signal shell
that I got from the sea ponies.

64
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,820
They said use it any time
I needed them.

Too old, am I?

69
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,140
Huh!
I'll show you who's too old!

70
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,340
Quiet down.

71
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,910
I can hear your
feathers squeaking.

72
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,180
As long as I'm alive, Squirk,

73
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,160
you'll never rule
this land again.

74
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,000
I've got news for you, Ruff.

75
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,570
When I get the Flashstone back,

76
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,700
that's exactly what I'll do.

77
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,880
Why, I'm gonna flood the land
just like it was before!

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,370
(laughs)

79
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,760
Hey, where is Pluma anyway?

80
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,620
She should have signaled
by now.

81
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,430
There's the signal now.

82
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,010
(wheezes)

83
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,480
Well, what are you
lying around for?

84
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,300
Get going and follow it!

85
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,220
Yes... Yes Squirk!
Right away.

86
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,120
I'm on my way -
right now, right now!

87
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,710
Crank?
Where's Squirk?

88
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,380
He's busy.
Give it to me!

89
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,800
You want it?
Come get it.

90
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,590
Ready Buttons?
Now!

91
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,250
Oh no!

92
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,400
[All gasp]

93
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,770
What in tarnation...
Who are you?

94
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,600
Friends of Pluma. We're here
to help you escape.

95
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,420
Squirk's going to
be mad at you, Crank.

96
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,840
He already is!

97
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,340
Er...uh...um...hi, boss.

98
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,510
(gasp)

99
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,130
Yikes!

100
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,800

101
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,010

(gasp)

103
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,470
Hey! Let go, before
I pull you under with it!

104
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,690
Give it back!

105
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,810
- Hold on, Crank!
- I am!

106
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,330
I've got you at last!

107
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,550
Wait for me.

108
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,480
Hurry, Fizzy, before
Squirk and Crank get back.

109
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,760
Going somewhere?

110
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,940
(growls)

111
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,990
We've got to do something before
all those plants are eaten away.

112
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,620
(gasps)

113
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,090
Pluma, can you change
shape and get us out of here?

114
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:25,710
I'll try...

115
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,010
Come on, Pluma!
You can do it.

116
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,960
Try harder, my dear!

117
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,630
Can't.
The ropes are too tight.

118
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,050
Then Ponyland's doomed.

119
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,310
Now all I've gotta do is
find the other half of this...
