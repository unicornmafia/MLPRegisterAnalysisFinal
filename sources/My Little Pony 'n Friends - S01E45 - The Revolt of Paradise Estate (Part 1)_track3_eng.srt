after the little grundle.

he went boom, boom, boom!

The tiny grundle"

17
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,550
Oh, hello, Cherries Jubilee.

18
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,140
What's the story?

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,940
Oh, it's about
the giant that goes, boom!

20
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,440
I thought you're gonna
be fixing things up.

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,960
See? Everything needs work.

22
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,700
Not everything.

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,400
Ouch!

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,400
- (giggles)
- Oh, my.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,990
Yes, everything.

26
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,950
Okay.

27
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,580
Baby Cuddles, why don't you run
along for your nap?

28
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,840
Paradise and I will get to work.

29
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,000
(wall crumbles)
Don't you dare.

30
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,750
Gosh, Paradise, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,600
It's not you, Sweet Stuff.
It's Paradise Estate.

32
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,560
It's simply...falling apart.

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,150
Even our tools are a mess.

34
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,020
But we promised
we'd fix up the Estate,

35
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,690
And I just couldn't face
the other ponies if we failed.

36
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,100
Come help me oil this shade.

37
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,940
Oh, dear!

38
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,540
I don't understand it.

39
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,670
It's never
this hard in fairytales.

40
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,170
I heard a story
once about a wizard

41
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,380
who cleaned up a whole kingdom
just by snapping his fingers.

42
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,040
I wish it were as easy for us.

43
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,470
There. Solid as a rock <i>slide...!</i>

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,360
Ah!

45
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,880
Whoa!

46
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,440
I have had it!

47
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,020
Come on, Sweet Stuff.

48
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,820
Where are we going?

49
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,480
To get some decent tools.

50
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,910
I'm glad we did this.

51
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,800
We needed a break, Sweet Stuff.

52
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,910
House work is so--so boring.

53
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,660
Why can't life be more like
a storybook anyway?

54
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,660
A good question indeed!

55
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,840
But chores need not be dreary,

56
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,670
if you have the right equipment.

57
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,690
Why he's got just
what we've been looking for!

58
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,010
Yes, but we need some nails
and a new broom and--

59
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,280
(chuckles)

60
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,320
Oh, I could sell
you all those things,

61
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,070
but this can of magic paint
is all you really need.

62
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,700
Paint?

63
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,410
You're kidding, right?

64
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,700
It will solve
all your household problems.

65
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,420
I guarantee anything
this paint touches will be

66
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,670
transformed into something new
and wonderful.

67
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,510
You may even have this
can as a free sample.

68
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,380
All right, we'll take it.

69
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,040
But Paradise--

70
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,020
Haven't you ever heard
the one about,

71
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,530
never look a gift pony
in the mouth?

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,470
Thank you.

73
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,560
(evil laugh)

74
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,540
Magic paint?

75
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,560
When Paradise?
When are you going to stop

76
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,130
believing such crazy stories?

77
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,240
Well, it can't hurt
to try it out.

78
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,340
You've got to admit,
it looks a little better.

79

(panting)
Oh, I can't take it anymore.

168

174
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,440
You ponies can't
keep nothing neat.

175
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,360
Why, we do a better job
ourselves, don't ya know?

176
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,520

(shouting continues)

181
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,780

182
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,700

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,620
Baby Cuddles!

187
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,870
Paradise, what's the matter?

188
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,950
We've got to get out of here.

189
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,830
No! Don't wanna leave my buggy.

190
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,800
Baby Cuddles, don't leave me.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,800
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

192
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,730
Is that everyone?

193
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,750
Almost.

194
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,320
You clods,
You're crushin' my fibers.

195
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,760
Ah! Oof!

(sobbing)

198
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,850
But that's our home.

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,240
Not anymore, Sweet Stuff.

200
