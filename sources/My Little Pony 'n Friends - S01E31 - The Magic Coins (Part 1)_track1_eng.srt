Isn't this a great
spot for picnic?

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,340
It's okay.

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,080
Yeah, I guess.

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,590
Hey, look out!

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,180
Shoo! Go away!

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,250
Whoa!

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,220
(All laugh)

17
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,210
You're lucky you didn't fall
in the water, Danny.

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,600
(singing in harmony)
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,720
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo

00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,350
(Sea pony)
<i>Oh, so what's wrong with water?</i>

21
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,940
Water is fun.

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,190
Watch.

23
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,390
Wee!

24
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,060
(whistles)

25
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,630
(thud)

26
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,160
(hinges creak)

27
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,180
(Sea Pony)
<i>Wow! Terrific!
A treasure chest!</i>

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
They're very pretty.

29
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,680
I wonder where they came from.

30
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,170
Virtually, anywhere I would say.

31
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,900
There are a myriad springs
and rapids in Ponyland

32
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,770
strong enough to carry it along.

33
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,150
I sense that there's more to
them than there appears to be.

34
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,400
(thud)

35
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,020
Ah, who cares?

36
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,820
We're here to have fun.

37
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,350
Come on! Let's play volleyball.

38
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,410
Hey! Wait a minute.

39
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,760
Where're we gonna get
a ball to play with?

40
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,420
No problem.

41
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,750
Watch this.

42
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,470
Here it comes.

43
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,550
I got it.

44
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,650
Hey, no fair flying.

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,160
Good one.

46
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,460
I wanna eat soon.
Hungry.

47
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,050
Hush now, Baby Lickety-Split,
it won't be long now.

48
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,850
Sweet Stuff, are you okay?

49
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,530
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,500
I'll pick all the coins up.

51
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,610
Go ahead and finish
your game first.

52
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,120
I got it. I--I got it.

53
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,370
I got it. I--oh!

54
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,960
Oops!

55
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,930
(Molly)
You got it all right, Gusty.

56
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,270
No sweat.
I'll just make another bubble.

57
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,130
I only wish I can make bubbles

58
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,880
that are big and strong enough
to keep our popcorn.

59
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,950
Huh! Wow!

60
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,140
Look at that!

61
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,190
Gee, pretty.

62
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,640
(Molly)
Can you do it again, Fizzy?

63
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,490
(inhales deeply)

64
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,730
(laughter and play)

65
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,470
(laughs)
This is me.

66
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,390
(laughs)

67
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,800
Don't break it, Molly,
you're too high.

68
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,580
Megan, help me.
I'm scared.

69
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,730
Get me down.

70
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,800
She's in trouble.
We gotta do something.

71
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,820
Salt?

72
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,080
Salt has a corrosive effect
if you sprinkle it

73
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,820
on the bubble's surface.

74
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,690
Good idea, Wind Whistler.

75
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,350
Let's go.

76
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,030
Push it that way Wind Whistler.
Over the pond.

77
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,790
Ahh..

78
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,010
(singing in harmony)
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo

79
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,710
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo

80
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,570
I glad Molly is safe.

81
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,560
But I feel hungry.

82
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,980
I wish there was food stacked
as high as a tree.

83
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,480
This is impossible.

84
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,540
I believe the coins are
responsible, Megan.

85
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,480
I saw Baby Lickety-Split
standing on one

86
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,720
as she made her wish.

87
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,840
And the coin glowed
and dematerialized.

88
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,170
Magic coins!
Magic coins!

89
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,350
I think Baby Half Note
might be right.

90
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,770
The symbol engraved
on each coin tells

91
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,610
what kind of wish
the coin grants.

92
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,650
(thundering)

93
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,820
(Danny)
<i>Looks like it's gonna rain.</i>

94
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,740
Picnic's over you guys.

95
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,610
Let's get back to the Estate.

96
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,340
I wish it never rained again.
Never again!

97
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,590
Hurray!

98
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,960
Now we can have
our picnic after all.

99
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,930
I've never seen a storm
clear up that fast before.

100
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,430
I know. It doesn't seem
quite normal somehow.

101
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,120
Posey, what's wrong?

102
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,040
Nothing but disaster.

103
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,820
Come and see.

104
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,470
This is terrible, Posey.

105
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,000
This meteorological debacle
is quite anomalous.

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,300
I mean,
it has not rained for weeks.

107
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,630
Something unusual is happening.

108
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,230
I guess I never
really realized...

109
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,350

00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,740
I made wish.

125
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,670
So that's why it hasn't rained.

126
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,760
Come on!

127
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,470
Heartthrob, did use
any of those coins?

128
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,500
Well, yes.

129
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,980
But only one and it was
for such a good cause.

130
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,270
Our Sweet Stuffs' makeup was
positively ruined by the heat.

131
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:47,360
And there was this coin
with a mask on it.

132
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,980
(Megan)
Sweet Stuff, where are you?

133
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,830
(Sweet Stuff)
<i>Over here.</i>

134
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,990
(Spike)
Why are you hiding, Sweet Stuff?

135
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,940
If you looked like this,
wouldn't you?

136
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,960
Megan, it is obvious

137
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,280
that the metaphysical power
of these coins can have

138
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,960
unforeseen and
hazardous side effects.

139
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,500
Not only that,

140
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,180
but wishing on them can get us
into a lot of trouble.

141
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,640
We better find those coins
and fast.

142
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,630
Magic Star, have you seen
the rest of the coins?

143
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,600
Sure, Megan.

144
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,720
I put 'em in my good
luck collection for safekeeping.

145
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,050
Great.

146
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,610
Go, get 'em.

147
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,480
Maybe we can get ourselves
out of this mess.

148
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,560
There are only three left.

149
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,080
I don't know what any
of these symbols mean.

150
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,870
Try wishing for rain on them.

151
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,950
(All)
We wish it would rain.

152
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,830
(All)
We wish it would rain.

153
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,000
(Magic Star)
Nothing.

154
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,660
Now what are we gonna do?

155
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,330
Ponyland's gonna dry
up and blow away.

156
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,470
We'll have to go
ask the Moochick.

157
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,670
He's our only hope.

158
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,970
<i>(feeble rhyming)
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo</i>

159
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,100
<i>Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo</i>

160
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,430

161
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,930
The Baby Seaponies.

162
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,430
They've run out of water.
