This is no time for games.

Get to work, Bushwoolies!

42
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,900
Take this to Catrina,

43
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,190
and whatever you do,
don't spill it.

44
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,680
There's hardly any left!

45

Spill it?

46
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,270
No, I won't spill it.
Uh-uh.

(purrs)

48
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,860

52
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,790
You spilled my
precious potion...

53
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,510
Get me some more!

54
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,100
I spilled it.

55
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,810
I told you to be careful.

56
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,280
Now she'll get mad at me.

57
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,870
Too bad.

58
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,360
We're tired of being slaves!

59
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,610
We're going to escape.

60
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,740
Yay! Escape, escape,
escape, escape.

61
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,030
Did you say escape?

62
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,830
Don't drop me!
Please don't drop me!

63
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,400
I'll show you what happens
to Bushwoolies

64
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,500
who want to escape!

65
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,990
Couldn't he just
lose a privilege?

66
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,580
Yeah, a privilege, a privilege!

67
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,130
You have no privileges,
you're my slaves.

68
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,500
(gasp)

69
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,170
No!

70
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,810
How dare you betray me?

71
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,240
Bring me some more
witch weed potion!

72
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,280
She's really not so bad
once you get to know her better.

73
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,520
We don't
want to know her better.

74
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,360
Yeah, we don't want to.

75
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,110
Better hurry,
Megan'll be here any minute.

76
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,840
Can we
blow up balloons, Sundance?

77
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,760
No, but you can give
me that string over there.

78
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,800
Okay.

79
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,540
Uh-oh...

80
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,970
I'll save them.

81
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,290
Whoah! Oops!

82
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,940
Sorry.

83
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,890
You're so clumsy, Sundance!

84
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,470
Yuck!
Now I have to take a bath.

85
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,620
It's Megan
and Sky Dancer.

86
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,360
Hold tight, Megan.

87
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,210
(Cheers)

88
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,990
As our guest of honour,
we want you to wear this.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,590
The Rainbow of Light.

90
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,660
It looks after us,
and keeps us safe.

91
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,010
Thanks, I'll
take good care of it.

I'm Baby Cotton Candy.

95
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,430
Oh, look at you.

96
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,180
Please play with us.

97
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,150
We have nothing to do.

98
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,020
Oh, yes you do.

99
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,860
If you want to stay up
for the costume ball tonight,

100
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,100
you need your rest.

101
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,980
But we don't wanna rest.

102
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,830
Into the nursery you go,
and no more complaints.

103
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,590
We never have fun anymore...

104
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,030
I'll take care of them, Posey.

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,610
Hey, Megan.

106
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,130
We don't want to take a nap.

107

We want to play!

108
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,500
Okay, let's not take a nap.

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,790
Maybe I can get you
shorter hours.

146
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,170
Shorter hours, yeah!

147
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,310
Too late for that.

148
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,500
Yeah, too late,
too late, too late, too late!

149
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,250
How about a week off
every summer?

150
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,010
Yeah, a week off, a week off.

151
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,020
No!

152
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,640

153
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,010
What about better food?

154
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,520
A window so you can see out?

155
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,830
Yeah, a window,
a window, Good idea!

156
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,020
NO!

157
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,770
Bushwoolies unite!

158
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,660
Yeah, unite, unite.

159
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,780
Please, don't
do this to me.

160
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,440
Escape!

161
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,330
Rep?

162
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,010
Yes?

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,170
Do you hear anything?

164
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,170
...No.

165
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,090
Neither do I.

166
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,170
The Bushwoolies
have stopped working.

167
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,890
Actually, Catrina,
that's not exactly true.

168
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,960
Then they're still working?

169
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,300
Well, no.

170
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,270
They escaped...

171
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,560
Escaped?

172
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,470
How could they escape?

173
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,800
You were guarding them!

174
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,810
Where are they?

175
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,530
There's one.

176
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,120
There's another one.

177
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,240
They're too fast.

178
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,550
We can't catch 'em.

179
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,820
What am I going to do?

180
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,710
Who's going to make
my precious potion?

181
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,740
It's almost gone.

182
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,040
(giggles)

183
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,510
My new slaves!

184
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,880
Now, how shall I trap them?

185
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,090
Poor Catrina...

186
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,010
You've grown so cold.

187
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,100
That's it! Cold.

188
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,420
I'll make a snowstorm.

189
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,320
What's happening?

190
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,940
It's getting so cold.

191
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,830
I'm freezing!

192
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,080
Help!

193
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,500
That's enough, Catrina!

194
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,250
I can't move.

195
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,550
We're trapped.

196
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,260
I...I...I think I can get out.

197
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,380
Just a little more... there!

198
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,550
Get Megan and
the Rainbow of Light!
