Tell her she can go.

170
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,130
Tell her
she'll always be in your heart,

171
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,020
just like
you'll always be in hers.

172
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:25,860
(snuffles and sobs)

173
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,720
It's okay, Dinah.

174
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,490
I understand,
you gotta go.

175
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:38,450
(woofs)

176
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,200
(All bark)

177
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,250
(All)
Goodbye, goodbye, Dinah!

178
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,050
Well, I believe
you're gonna miss Dinah,

179
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,750
I truly do.

180
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,500
Of course, I will.

181
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,650
After all the
ice-cream cones I snuck her.

182
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,730
(sympathizes)
After all that complaining
you were doing.

183
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,350
Magic Star's right.
I do declare,

184
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,900
friends may have to leave ya

185
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,650
but they'll always be with ya
in your heart.

186
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,420
Thanks Truly.

187
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,910
I needed to hear that.

188
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,030
Even if she was a big ol' mutt!

189
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,280
