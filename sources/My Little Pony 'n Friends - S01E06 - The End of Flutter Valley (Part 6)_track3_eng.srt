Help! Somebody, help!

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,590
Help us!

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,670
Oh,
it's getting so hot up here!

13
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,440
Hey,

14
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,930
watch where you're dripping,
Forget-Me-Not.

15
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,230
Maybe if
the honey melts enough,

16
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,430
we'll be able to move again
and get out of here.

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,910
You're right, Rosedust.

18
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,240
It's working.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,440
Yeah, I can move
my wings again.

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,320
I can almost fly.

21
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,340
If only I could
get out of here,

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,250
I could help the other
Flutter Ponies.

23
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,370
Oh, it's all Sting's fault.

24
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,870
I thought he was my friend.

25
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,260
I am your friend.

26
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,210
(gasp)
Sting!

27
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,710
But I thought you left
to join Bumble?

28
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,680
I did, but I couldn't find her.

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,470
You mean she
flew away without you?

30
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,100
Guess so.

31
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,690
Guess she isn't
really my friend.

32
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,640
Well,
we could still be friends.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,310
I'd like that, Morning Glory.

34
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,980
Let's see if we can save
the rest of the Flutter Ponies.

35
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,450
We have to move the Sunstone.

36
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,230
No sweat.
I'll take care of that.

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,580
What are you gonna do?

38
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,120
Mission accomplished.

39
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,140
But the Sunstone is gone.

40
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,330
So what? The fire's out.

41
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,160
So what?!

42
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,090
It's a calamity!

43
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,310
Without the Sunstone,

44
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,250
Flutter Valley will be no more.

45
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,150
It's finished.

46
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,420
Oh, well that's
a definite problem.

47
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,820
Keep trying, Flutter Ponies.
We almost made it.

48
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,690
Try harder.

49
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,020
There must be something
we can do to help.

50
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,200
You'd better help yourself
first, Morning Glory.

51
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,070
Grab her, Sting!

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,170
No, Bumble.

53
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,910
Morning Glory is my friend.

54
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,750
Don't be ridiculous.

55
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,950
The Flutter Ponies
are not our friends.

56
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,120
They're my friends, Bumble.

57
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,770
You realize of course, Sting,

58
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,260
that your attitude borders
on betrayal.

59
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,630
Well, what you've done
isn't so nice either.

60
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,770
Let the Flutter Ponies go
and I'll apologize.

61
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,930
Never.
They're mine.

62
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,030
Pointer, take Sting
and Morning Glory prisoner.

63
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,690
Got you, your Bumbleness.

64
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,030
Get them!

65
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,820
- Duck!
- Agh!

66
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,710
To the air!

67
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,950
Hey, Sting's flying.
He can't do that.

68
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,330
After them!

69
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,460
Oh my...
I am beautiful!

70
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,910
I've been waiting
for this chance, Sting.

71
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,630
Well, you've got it, Pointer.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,500
Way to go, Sting.
Whoah!

73
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,180
Let's get out of here.

74
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,610
(laughs awkwardly)

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,100
Sorry, your Bumbleness.

76
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,990
(laughs sarcastically)

77
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,850
(screams)

78
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,190
We made it.

79
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,120
We're free.

80
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,830
The Flutter Ponies
have escaped.

81
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,280
There's too much honey
on my wings.

82
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,210
I can't fly.

83
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,050
Then run, Flutter Ponies, run.

84
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,270
Oh, if only we could fly again.

85
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,680
We never were great runners.

86
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,300
I want that Sunstone back,
Flutter Ponies,

87
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,800
and you're going to help me.

88
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,820
The Sunstone's ours, Bumble.

89
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,360
We need it to bring
Flutter Valley back to life.

90
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,610
Oh, come on, come on, come on!

91
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,740
Hydia hates me,
she hates me not.

92
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,880
She hates me, she hates me not.
she hates me...

93
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,740
Oh!

94
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,240
Hydia hates me,
she hates me not.

95
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,740
Ouch!

96
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,420
How much longer until
Flutter Valley rots, Hydia?

97
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,390
Soon.

98
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,730
When the sun sets,

99
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,340
Flutter Valley will be dark,
dank and dreary - for good.

100
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,840
Just the way we like it.

101
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,730
(laughs)

102
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,850
Oh, we're running out of time,
little ponies.

103
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,980
If we don't get the Sunstone
back here soon,

104
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,750
we can kiss
Flutter Valley goodbye.

105
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,160
If only one of us could
just escape and get some help.

106
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,160
But how do we get past Ahhg?

107
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,110
Roooaaaahhhhggggrrr!

108
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,750
(gasp)
I have an idea.

109
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,280
(whispers)

110
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,350
Oh no, you won't.

111
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,170
I won't do it.

112
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,120
Nope, uh-uh.
Nope, uh-uh.

113
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,670
Please, Furbob. You have to,
it's our only chance.

114
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,600
Yours too.

115
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,110
Okay.
But this better work.

116
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,850
Close your eyes, Furbob.

117
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,800
I don't want to get
any bubble in them.

118
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,610
It's working!

119
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,110
Go, Fizzy! Way to go!

120
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,400
You can open your eyes now,
Furbob.

121
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,280
(laughs)
Hey, this is fun.

122
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,490
Hey Ahhg,

123
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,710
bet you don't have
many friends, do you?

124
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,220
Rooooaaaaggghhhr!

125
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,070
Want to play with our friend?

126
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,420
Roooaaagghhhr!

127
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,130
All you have to do is
let him out,

128
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,330
and he'll play with you.

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,830
(gasp)

130
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,060
(laughs)

131
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,760
Whoah!

132
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,070
It worked.

133
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,520
Run, Furbob.

134
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,940
- Get help.
- Run for it.

135
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,200
Roooooaaaaggghhhr!

136
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,360
(cheers)

137
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,490
Oh, you let them escape,
you buzzoff! Oof!

138
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,420
Rooaaaaggghhr!

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,170
Whoah ho ho hooo!

140
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,750
Don't be upset, Hydia.
It's okay.

141
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,520
Yeah, what can
one skinny old furbob do?

142
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,680
You'll see, witches.
You'll see.

143
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,440
I don't know if
I did the right thing.

144
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,260
By leaving Bumbleland?

145
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,310
All I ever wanted
was for Bumble to like me.

146
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,350
I like you.

147
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,610
Thanks, Morning Glory.

148
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,820
But there's only two of us.

149
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,810
How can we possibly save
the rest of the Flutter Ponies

150
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,640
and the Sunstone too?

151
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,740
Look, a rainbow!

152
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,950
What good is a rainbow?

153
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,780
It's just pretty, that's all.

154
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,290
Megan lives on the other side.

155
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,500
I remember the little ponies
telling us that.

156
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,490
Who's Megan?

157
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,490
She always helps
the little ponies

158
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,740
when they're in trouble.

159
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,890
Maybe she'll help us.
Let's go!

160
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,460
Do you know how to get there?

161
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,730
No...
But it can't be that difficult.

162
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,580
We have to try.

163
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,650

164

184
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,480
This is where Megan lives?

185
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,160
It looks like the place
the little ponies told us about.

186
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,750
Let's see if we can find her.

187
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,370
I've never seen a Megan before.

188
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,630
What would she look like?

189
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,890
Well, she's kind of big,

190
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,960
and...and has long hair -
only on her head,

191
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,890
and... Oh... Well,

192
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,130
you'll know her when
you see her.

193
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,230
Megan!

194
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,470
Are you here, Megan?

195
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,850
Not here.

196
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,560
What if she's gone
on a trip or something?

197
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,980
Oh, she just has to be here.
We need her.

198
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,490
Uh-oh...

199
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,190
Is that Megan?

200
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,950
(snorts)

201
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,990
Run!

202
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,200
In there!

203
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,440
Over the rainbow is not such
a safe place to live either.

204
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,370
If only Megan were here.

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,870
Oh no!

206
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,750
(snorts)

207
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,790
(Both)
MEGAN!

208
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,700
(snorts)
