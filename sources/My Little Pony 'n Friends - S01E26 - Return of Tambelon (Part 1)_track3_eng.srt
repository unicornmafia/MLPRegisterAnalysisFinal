Okay, Paradise,
you're it this time.

11
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,500
We hide and you go seek.

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,880
Very well,
but remember you unicorns,

13
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,090
winking out
is against the rules.

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,380
One...two...three...

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,630
(All laugh)

16
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,100
Paradise
never find me here.

17
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,230
Hide with me, Shady.

18
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,620
(squeaking)

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,740
Oh, no!
Paradise find me for sure.

20
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,870
Nine...ten.

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,750
Ready or not?
Here I come!

22
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:30,410
Hey, no fair!
Baby Ribbon winked out.

23
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,930
Baby Ribbon, you know

24
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,580
winking out
is against the rules.

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,180
Now wink back in this minute.

26
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,050
I didn't mean to.

27
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,320
It's okay.

28
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,340
Wink all the way back in,
so we can get on with the game.

29
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,740
I'll try.
(laughs)

30
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,930
She has such trouble
winking back in.

31
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,320
Come on Baby Ribbon,
want you to play some more.

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,820
Come on, little one,
you can do it.

33
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,270
I did it!

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,290
Okay, let's start over.
I'll be it again.

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,690
One...two...

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,830
I'll hide in the pool.

37
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,600
Do you mind?

38
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,120
<i>(Paradise)
Ready or not?
Here I come!</i>

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,220
Someone is hiding
behind that rock.

40
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,360
And I think it's Baby Ribbon.

41
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,020
Oh! Not again!

42
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,820
She's no fun.

43
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,280
Baby Ribbon, we're waiting.

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,700
Boy, this is pathetic!

45
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,820
Oh, come on!
She's just a baby.

46
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,570
Looks like she's having
more trouble than usual.

47
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,040
Maybe she winked back
somewhere else.

48
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,490
I'll see if I can find her.

49
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,660
Back in a jiffy.

50
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,250
(Molly)
Something has happened to them.
I just know it.

51
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,830
We better tell Megan.

52
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,970
I wonder where they
could have gone?

53
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,170
<i>(Ribbon)
Baby Ribbon, where are you?</i>

54
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,850
For that matter, where am I?

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
(gasps)
Ah!

56
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,680
(Megan)
Now let's not jump
to conclusions.

57
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,570
We don't know for certain
that they're in trouble.

58
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,100
I have a bad feeling about it.

59
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,580
I've got to find out
what's happened to them.

60
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,250
Galaxy, wait!

61
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,040
Oh, no! She's gone too.

62
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,450
Now hold on.

63
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,030
After all, it's only been
a couple of seconds.

64
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,530
The unicorns wink in and
out instantly, Megan.

65
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,100
If Galaxy had found
Ribbon and Baby Ribbon,

66
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,870
they'd be back by now.

67
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,260
- What's going on?
- I think they'll be back.

68
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,370
All right, listen to me.

69
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,800
Spread the word,

70
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,020
no more winking out
until we know what's going on.

71
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,360
Is that clear?

72
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,960
Perfectly.
Good thinking, Megan.

73
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,640
Come on!

74
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,950
Let's tell the other unicorns
while there's still time.

75
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,070
(play and laughter)

76
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,030
I'm the queen of the mountain.

77
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,310
I'll wink up there and show her.

78
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,740
(both gasp)
Ah!

79
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,300
Baby Gusty, stop!

80
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,570
(Both)
Oh! no!

81
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,420
(singing in harmony)
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo

82
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,550
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo

83
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,730
What's wrong, Fizzy?

84
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,220
I wanna cross the water.

85
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,820
Use the rocks.

86
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,390
I'm afraid I'll fall in.

87
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,150
I think I'll just wink across.

88
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,400
(singing in harmony)
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo

89
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,650
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo

90
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,110
Hi, have you seen Fizzy around?

91
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,750
She just winked out.

92
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,110
But she didn't wink
back in again.

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,040
I'm afraid Gusty's gone too.

94
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,910
She was so impatient
to run back here for lunch,

95
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,840
so she winked out instead.

96
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,930
That means I'm the
only unicorn left.

97
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,710
Let's get the other ponies.

98
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,420
We've got to form
search parties

99
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,770
and try to find the unicorns.

100
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,610
It's getting dark.

101
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,980
We're gonna have to get back
to Paradise Estate.

102
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,120
Just let me look
around this rock.

103
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,230
Buttons come back.

104
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,940
Those rocks look like
they might give way.

105
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,320
She winked out.
I saw her.

106
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,120
So did I.

107
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,750
<i>(breathes heavily)</i>

108
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,470
<i>(gasps)</i>

109
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,170
<i>Tambelon</i>

110
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,900
(breathes heavily)

111
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,070
I heard Ribbon say Tambelon,
then I woke up.

112
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,270
Tambelon? Hmm!

113
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,520
It sounds familiar.

114
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,340
Something to do with the
legend of a lost city.

115
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,610
I'm sure that Ribbon was trying
to reach me telepathically.

116
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,010
But from where?

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,200
We'll never see them again.

118
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,620
No, no. They'll come back.

119
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,670
But from where?

120
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,260

00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,070
According to the ancient legend,

135
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,580
Tambelon is the
realm of darkness,

136
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,450
a sort of in-between place.

137
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,420
It last appeared 500 years ago,

138
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,130
and its ruler, Grogar,
tried to conquer Ponyland.

139
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,580
So what happened?

140
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,180
How did he wind up back
in the Realm of Darkness?

141
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,170
Ah...I don't remember.

142
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,550
But Grogar swore he would return
in 500 years to try again.

143
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,110
That still doesn't explain
what happened to the unicorns.

144
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,600
If Tambelon changes slowly

145
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,550
from the realm of darkness
to Ponyland,

146
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,970
maybe one part changed
faster than the others.

147
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,690
And somehow caught the unicorns

148
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,560
when they were
winking in and out.

149
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,640
You mean they might
be in Tambelon?

150
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,330
<i>(Bray)
Little Unicorns had best eat.</i>

151
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,750
<i>No telling
when the next meal might come,</i>

152
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,800
if it comes.

153
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,630
(cackles)

154
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,760
There's gotta to be some way
to get out of here.

155
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,890
How?

156
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,060
We can't wink through walls
and that door is locked.

157
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,510
Isn't there anything we can do?

158
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,690
I've already done
the only thing.

159
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,480
I just hope my dream message
got through to Megan.

160
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,830
The unicorns
have been fed, master.

161
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,620
Excellent!

162
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:59,080
Now Bray, we will reach
Ponyland very soon.

163
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,200
Prepare the Troggles
for arrival.

164
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,420
Yes, master, right away.

165
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,370
(Grogar)
Oh, and Bray...

166
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,520
...don't dawdle, mmm.

167
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,380
No, no master, no dawdling.

168
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,770
Of course, not master,
right away, master.

169
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,050
We'll form search
parties again today.

170
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,600
<i>(thundering)</i>

171
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,450
I've never seen a storm
come up so fast before.

172
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,450
This isn't a storm.

173
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,900
It's Tambelon!

174
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,740
In the name of Grogar!

175
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,910
Capture the little ponies.

176
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,460
Run!

177
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,480
Get the little ponies!

178
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,470
(screaming)

179
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,160
It's done master.

180
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,850
Dream Valley is yours.

181
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,170
<i>(Grogar)
Exactly as I planned.</i>

182
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,820
Today, Dream Valley.

183
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,210
Tomorrow, all of Ponyland.
