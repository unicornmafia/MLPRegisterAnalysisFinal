Honeysuckle,

11
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,050
are you okay?

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, she's gone.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,470
Gone, but not forgotten.

14
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,340
She'll always be remembered

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,090
as the Flutter Pony
who tried to dump me,

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,240
but got dumped herself!
(laughs)

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,150
Oh my,
I'm so poetic sometimes.

18
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,850
All right, back to work,
Flutter Ponies.

19
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,350
We'll get a new claw
and fix the crane.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,500
But we've got to get that
Sunstone out of the hole.

21
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,500
I'll talk to Bumble.

22
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,660
No, Megan.
Talking won't work.

23
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,680
The Furbob's right.

24
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,000
I am?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,500
Bumble's too mean
to listen to reason.

26
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,020
But we have to
try to find the good in people.

27
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,210
That's right.
I have to try.

28
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,710
Wait for me.
I'm coming with you!

29
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,110
Morning Glory.

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,720
Megan.

31
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,850
Grab her!

32
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,480
Wait, I've come to talk.

33
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,730
Talk?

34
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,030
Who are you?

35
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,230
What are you?

36
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,980
I'm Megan,
a friend of the Flutter Ponies.

37
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,660
I'm asking you to let them go

38
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,370
and give them back
their Sunstone.

39
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,540
(laughs)

40
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,040
Surely you jest,
yes?

41
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,420
No, as a matter of fact,

42
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,060
you're surrounded!

43
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,590
Do as I ask,

44
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,760
and no harm will come to you.

45
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,340
Agh!

46
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,640
Megan!

47
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,570
Help!

48
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,560
Let's go.

49
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,760
Yikes!

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,240
Come on, Flutter Ponies.
Let's fly.

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,770
We can't. There's still honey
on our wings.

52
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,170
But we can try to run again.

53
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,610
Swarm them!

54
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,370
Don't let them get away!

55
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,500
I'll save you, Megan.

56
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,370
Grab hold!

57
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,680
Gotchya.

58
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,350
Whoaaaaa!

59
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,390
Ugh, thanks Furbob.

60
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,650
- Oh...
- I've got you now, Sting.

61
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,120
Ouch!
(buzz)

62
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,870
Sting, are you okay?

63
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,580
I think so...

64
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,820
Can...can you pull
this stinger out?

65
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,790
Thanks, Morning Glory.
I owe ya.

66
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,490
To the victor
goes the Sunstone.

67
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,830
(buzz)

68
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,470
Aww, cheer up, Draggle.

69
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,240
Not being able to do magic
isn't the end of the world.

70
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,480
It is if you're a witch.

71
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,320
Especially if Hydia's
your mother.

72
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,020
Why don't you let us go?

73
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,240
Yeah. That'll show Hydia
she shouldn't make fun of you.

74
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,160
Oh no, I couldn't do that.

75
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,990
She'd never forgive me.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,460
She'd kick me out of the
Volcano of Gloom for good.

77
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,700
What's wrong with that?

78
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,200
(whispers)

79
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,090
We have an idea, Draggle.

80
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,670
We'll teach you some pony magic.

81
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,770
You will?

82
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,210
Sure! Then you can make
Hydia proud of you.

83
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,260
She'll think
you're the greatest.

84
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,310
What do I have to do?

85
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,550
Just watch and listen.

86
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,800
You might want to take notes.

87
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,970

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,830
Bye, Draggle. See ya!

111
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,510
You tricked me,
you miserable little ponies.

112
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,290
Wait 'till I get out of here!

113
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,520
I'll get you.

114
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,710
It's almost sunset.

115
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,230
There's not much time
to find the Sunstone!

116
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,720
Or the Flutter Ponies.

117
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,860
We've got to
get to Bumbleland now!

118
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,720
I think it's that way.

119
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,870
Hop on, Spike.

120
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,890
I'll give you a ride!

121
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,070
Through there.

122
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:09,080
Hey, it's only a painting.

123
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,640
It's sticking to us.

124
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,630
It's fly paper.
It's a trap!

125
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,500
(groan)

126
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,010
(cackles)

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,010
That's a taste of real magic,
little ponies.

128
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,260
Take 'em away, Ahg!

129
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,430
Rooaaagghhhrr.

130
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,100
What you gonna do to Draggle?

131
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,600
Something bad, I hope.

132
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,490
Really punish her.

133
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,990
Is that any way to
talk about your sister?

134
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,240
Well, I, Uh...

135
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,110
I just thought that...

136
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,330
Shut up!

137
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,450
Let's go watch
Flutter Valley rot.

138
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,620
It's almost sunset.

139
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,210
Flutter Valley's going to
shrivel up to nothing...

140
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,760
I'm sorry, Morning Glory.

141
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,090
I wasn't much help.

142
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,360
Don't give up.

143
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,100
Remember, it's never over
'till the fat lady stings!

144
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,800
That really makes me feel
a lot better, Sting.

145
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,570
(slurps)
Another one!

146
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,530
Sorry, your Bumbleness.

147
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,480
There are no more.

148
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,560
No more?

149
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,830
No more beautiful
nectar-filled flowers?

150
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,370
We cleaned out the forest.

151
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,900
There aren't any more
for miles!

152
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,830
But if we had the Sunstone,

153
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,710
it would attract the sun,

154
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,320
and the flowers would grow

155
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,220
and I'd have my nectar.

156
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,460
Right?

157
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,380
But we can't reach the
Sunstone, your Bumbleness.

158
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,140
Psst...

159
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,140
Honeysuckle!

160
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,420
Shh.

161
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,310
Get the Flutter Ponies and
go down the hole.

162
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,190
Don't worry, it's safe.

163
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,660
What about Bumble and her bees?

164
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,830
They've got a surprise coming.

165
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,070
You ready?

166
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,520
Now, Stonebacks, NOW!

167
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,040
The Stonebacks?

168
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,860
(Stonebacks snort)

169
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,760
To the hole, Flutter Ponies.
Hurry!

170
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,540
Honeysuckle!

171
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,520
But we thought you were...

172
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,140
What happened?

173
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,260
Later, Rosedust.

174
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,390
Just get everybody
down the hole.

175
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,360
Follow me, Flutter Ponies.

176
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,550
Hi, Honeysuckle.

177
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,450
Hi, Peach Blossom.

178
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,690
Hi, Honeysuckle.

179
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,940
Hi, Forget-Me-Not.

180
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,490
What's going on here?

181
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,570
Whoaaaah!

182
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,530
Your Bumbleness!

183
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,650
Whoooooaaah!

184
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,080
That's enough, Stonebacks.

185
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,380
Retreat!

186
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,800
(snorts)

187
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,750
Where's the Furbob?

188
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,720
I thought he was with you.

189
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,970
I'll get him.

190
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,230
You're next, Sting.

191
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,430
Sting?

192
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,770
Come on, Furbob.
We have to go!

193
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,730
I...I can't.

194
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,980
I'm afraid of the Stonebacks.

195
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,060
They'll hurt me.

196
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,280
No, they won't.
They're helping us.

197
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,600
It must be a trick.

198
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,500
They're our mortal enemies.

199
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,990
Nothing will happen to you,
I promise.

200
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,860
Please, Furbob. Come on.

201
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,500
Move out!

202
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,030
Hurry!

203
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,590
Go on, Furbob.

204
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,840
You first.

205
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,090
Okay!

206
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,960
Get 'em!
