(Danny)
Well, here's another fine mess
we've gotten ourselves into.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,530
It's my fault.

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,010
I trusted Drog
and he led us into a trap.

13
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,020
It was a risk
worth taking, Danny.

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,540
Don't worry.
We're not beaten yet.

15
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,600
But midnight is not
far off, Megan.

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,470
And when it strikes,

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,980
we shall all be banished
to the Realm of Darkness.

18
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,220
I can't help,

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,470
but feel that the big bell
we found is important.

20
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,020
It has something to do
with Grogar's power.

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,230
I'm certain of it.

22
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,900
<i>(door creaks and slams)</i>

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,040
In you go, traitor.

24
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,910
(cackles)

25
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,070
He called you a traitor.

26
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,960
That means you didn't betray us.

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,380
A few Troggles
are still loyal to Grogar.

28
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,490
They told him
of my plan to help you.

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,470
Well, that wasn't very nice.

30
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,760
But most of my people
are fed up with Grogar.

31
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,000
They would help you
against him,

32
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,150
if you would give us
a new home in Ponyland.

33
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,390
You bet we would.

34
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,090
(All)
Oh, yes. We would. Why not?

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,860
But how can we get word
to the rest of the Troggles.

36
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,730
We can't escape this dungeon.

37
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,270
Good news, master.

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,950
The Moochick and the baby ponies
have been captured.

39
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,210
<i>That means Ponyland is mine.</i>

40
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,160
This calls for a celebration.

41
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,130
Tell the Troggles that anyone
not found celebrating

42
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,670
will be banished along with
the ponies at midnight.

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,300
Er...rh...right away, master.

44
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,130
Now, start the spell

45
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,440
that will banish the ponies
from Ponyland forever.

46
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,270
(thundering)

47
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,620
<i>(crowd jubilating)</i>

48
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,210
Wonder what
they're so happy about?

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,820
They're not.

50
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,700
They're just following
Grogar's orders.

51
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,970
<i>(jubilation continues)</i>

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,790
That's funny.
It sounds louder over here.

53
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,050
<i>(jubilation continues)</i>

54
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,560
And it gets louder
the higher I go.

55
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,500
It's loudest at this crack.

56
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,000
And there's fresh air
coming through.

57
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,730
If there were some way
to widen the crack,

58
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,520
something
we could force into it.

59
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,560
Barf!
Try this.

60
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,600
I'd rather pour it
in a crack than eat it.

61
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,900
If we could put the gruel into
the crack and make it bubble,

62
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,900
it would expand
and make the crack bigger.

63
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,000
I've got it!

64
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,610
Forget-Me-Not,
you and Peach Blossom,

65
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,490
carry the bucket
up to the crack.

66
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,370
(strenuous effort)

67
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,370
Okay.
Now Buttons,

68
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,960
you move the soup
from the bucket into the crack.

69
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,830
I'll try.

70
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,800
But everybody get out
from underneath, just in case.

71
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,210
Hurry,
We can't hold it much longer.

72
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,530
(Blossom)
Look out! Below!

73
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,200
Phew!

74
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,280
Fizzy, you've got to make
that stuff in the crack bubble.

75
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,310
Okay.

76
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,500
Hey, it's working.

77
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,990
Look out!

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,550
(screaming)

79
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,460
I'd say, good show.

80
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,670
Forget-Me-Not, come with us.

81
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,920
We'll find a way
to get the door open.

82
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,350
Hurry! We've got to find Bray
and get those keys from him.

83
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,900
Look, there's Bray!

84
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,820
(Megan)
Not so fast, Bray.

85
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,780
What?

86
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,000
Hey stop!
Hey, hey...

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,510
What are you doing?
Get away from me!

88
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,460
I'll take those.

89
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,270
(gasps)
Stop! Come back!

90
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,770
No!

91
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,610
Grogar's gonna be mad
when he hears about this.

92
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,800
Hee-haw!

93
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,470
Let's go everybody.
It's almost midnight.

94
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,530
<i>(Grogar)
Escaped!</i>

95
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,480
<i>You fool!</i>

96
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,500
It wasn't my fault.

97
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,410
If they get out of the city,
you will take their place.

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,260
(jubilation)

99
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,050
The ponies are free.

100
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,220
Now it's time
to set ourselves free.

101
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,510
(jubilation)

102
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,980
Help us against Grogar,
and you'll be free!

103
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,660
What do we do now?

104
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,180
We've got to reach
the gates before midnight.

105
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,500
Come on!

106
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,200
<i>(clock ticking)</i>

107
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,700
<i>(ticking continues)</i>

108
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,020
It's Grogar!

109
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:30,710
<i>Boy, if it isn't one thing,
it's another.</i>

110
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,470
I say! It looks like
we're trapped.

111
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,350
(Danny)
Somebody think of something.

112
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,450
I'm trying, but nothing
rings any bells!

113
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,870
Ring the bell!
That's it!

114
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,980
Excuse me, what was that?

115
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,570
The bell we found
in the hidden room.

116
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,620
Legend says
that when it's rung,

117
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,120
Grogar's power
will be destroyed.

118
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,570
It's our only chance.

119
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,550
North Star,
can you find your way

120
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,790
back to that bell in time?

121
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,050
A mere trifle, Megan.

122
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,300
(Megan)
Then let's go!

123
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,160

But where are Megan
and North Star?

144
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,860
Look! Here they come!

145
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,540
You did it, Megan.

146
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,200
What happened to
Grogar and Bray?

147
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,450
They're gone,

148
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,090
back into the Realm of
Darkness with Tambelon.

149
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,540
(cheer and merriment)

150
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,090
(Megan)
Well, I hope you
and the rest of the Troggles

151
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,960
enjoy living in Ponyland, Drog.

152
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,840
I'm sure we will.

153
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,860
But I still can't believe
Grogar is really gone for good.

154
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,350
Well, it took him 500 years
to build the old bell

155
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,610
even with the Troggle's help.

156
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,530
So I don't think
he'll be back anytime soon.

157
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,400
Look!

158
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,480
You don't think
it's Grogar, do you?

159
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,490
Guess not.
(sighs)
