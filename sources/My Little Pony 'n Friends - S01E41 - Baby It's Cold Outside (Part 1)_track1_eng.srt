Wow!

12
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,840
(laughing outside)
Look at me!

13
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,800
Come on sleepies, wake up.

14
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,640
Look, pretty!

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,890
Oh boy!

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,400
(giggling)

17
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,640
Whoopee!

18
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,310
(loud giggling)

19
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,230
Hey there, you two.

20
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,860
You wanna help me build
a little ol' snow pony?

21
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,330
(All)
For sure! Yeah!

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,400
Uh, Truly...

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,120
U-uh, watch yourself, Galaxy.

24
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,620
Truly, I don't think
you understand.

25
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,830
North Star, honey,

26
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,800
you gonna play
by yourself all day

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,140
or do you wanna help us here?

28
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,640
(Baby Pony)
Yay! All done! It looks pretty.

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,510
North Star,
I'm worried about the snow.

30
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,350
It's not natural
this time of year.

31
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,060
I don't wanna spoil
anyone's fun but--

32
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,330
Well, you are spoilin' my fun,
and the babies' too!

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,990
Now if ya have ta worry,

34
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,940
why don't you just go
worry by yourself, hear?

35
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,280
C'mon ya all, let's build forts
and have a snowball fight.

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,200
(sighs)

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,700
(Sonny)
Whew! W-well
I hope your d-d-dad knows

38
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,920
why it's so c-c-cold
where I live, Edgar!

39
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,670
(Edgar)
Don't worry, Sonny.

40
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,010
We'll find out what's going on.

41
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,020
We wanna see my dad.

42
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,800
Why has Sonny's home
become so cold, father?

43
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,730
Yeah.
M-my wh-whole family is packing

44
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,900
to g-g-go south for the w-winter
and it's s-still s-s-summer.

45
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,710
Don't bother packing.

46
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,070
Soon, there will be no south
for your family to go to.

47
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:44,790
Soon there will be no place
for anyone, but us penguins!

48
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,660
The power of my icy cold stare
may be small,

49
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,800
but when magnified
by this machine

50
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,250
it creates a wind so cold
that soon the whole world

51
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,600
will be frozen over,

52
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,090
all who are unworthy of living

53
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,230
in such a lovely climate
will be frozen.

54
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,280
<i>And I shall rule
the whole world.</i>

55
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,580
As will you, Edgar,
when you become king.

56
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,910
No, father!

57
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:27,860
What?

58
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,500
I don't wanna rule the world,

59
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,540
And even if I did,
it wouldn't be right.

60
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,920
When you are king,

61
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,140
you may decide
what is and is not right.

62
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,210
But I am king now,
and what I say is law.

63
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,110
Is that clear?

64
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,470
But why should only
penguins survive?

65
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,190
Yeah. What's wrong
with bein' a duck?

66
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,020
They're weak.

67
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,320
(Sonny)
How?

68
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,030
Can they withstand the cold?

69
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,860
Why should w-w-we have to?

70
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,750
Sonny!
(sobs)

71
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,910
He is but
a bad influence on you.

72
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,660
You won't be listening
to his nonsense anymore.

73
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,310
Guards!

74
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,400
(sobbing)
How could you?

75
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,300
When you are king,
you'll understand these things.

76
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,490
(giddy laughter)

77
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,440
Is that the best ya all can do,
North Star, honey?

78
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,320
All right, baby.

79
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,200
Give it a good swat.

80
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,860
(Galaxy)
Stop this all of you.

81
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,780
Haven't any of you noticed
how could it's gotten?

82
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,450
(yawns)

83
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,670
All of our beautiful trees are
barren and covered with frost.

84
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,290
And when was the last time

85
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,290
anyone saw
a bird or a butterfly.

86
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,290
(Sea Shimmer)
Galaxy, Truly,
all of Ponyland...

87
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,890
(Surf Rider)
...is like freezing over.

88
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,440
Goodness me!
Look at the rainbow.

89
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,390
I dare say it is freezing too.

90
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,310
Looks like I was wrong.

91
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,110
This is a worry.
We need help.

92
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,460
North Star,
you better go fetch Megan,

93
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,620
if you can still
get over the rainbow.

94
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,790
I cold now, Truly.

95
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,540
We'll be okay real soon.
Don't you worry.

96
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,790

(giggling)

118
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,070
Heya, Megan! Boy, oh boy,

119
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,200
I bet you're
surprised to see me.

120
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,400
(laughs)

121
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,150
Relieved is more like it.

122
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,870
I've been terribly worried ever
since the rainbow froze over.

123
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,540
What's happened in Ponyland?

124
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,870
We don't know.

125
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,220
We hoped you could help.

126
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,870
Can ya make it back?

127
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,970
(shivering)
I-I don't know...

128
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,910
My wings are awfully cold.

129
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,710
I thought that might happen.

130
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,310
Wait right here.

131
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,130
For once,
I've got a surprise for you.

132
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,640
Wing warmers, huh?

133
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,300
Ohh! Neat!

134
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,600
I knitted them myself.

135
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,890
Great idea!
(giggles)

136
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,940
(shivers)

137
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,070
(Galaxy)
Look! Surprise made it.

138
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,590
Megan, thank goodness
you're here.

139
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,530
(Truly)
Are we glad to see you!

140
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,360
Surprise explained the situation
to me on the way here.

141
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,090
But it's more serious here
than I thought.

142
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,590
I don't know what we should do.

143
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,290
I know... We'll go North!

144
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,120
That's where
it's always coldest

145
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,270
(Truly)
Oh, yeah, right.

146
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,380
Just what we need...
To get colder...

147
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,630
Good thinking.

148
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,930
Don't you see?

149
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,220
North is where
we'll probably

150
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,720
find the source
of this cold wave.

151
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,020
She's right.

152
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,300
The cold has to come
from somewhere

153
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,230
and it normally
comes from North.

154
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,400
(North Star)
Come, this way is north.

155
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:05,980
Tally-ho!

156
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,230
(Surprise)
Okay. So we went North.

157
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,460
Now, anybody got a clue
as to what we're looking for?

158
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,550
We just have to be patient.
Keep at it, Surprise.

159
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,570
(shivers)
But I'm so cold.

160
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,930
Galaxy, get a load of this!

161
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,920
It's Surf Rider and Sea Shimmer.

162
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,560
(Galaxy)
Yes!

163
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,470
And I think they're trying
to lead us somewhere.

164
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,610
Follow me everybody.
This way.

165
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,980
(North Star)
Thank you, Sea Shimmer.

166
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,240
You too, Surf Rider.

167
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,110
We'll have to go the rest
of the way on our own.

168
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,920
The ice is too thick
for you to swim under.

169
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,200
Surprise and I
shall fly overhead

170
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,700
and guide the rest of you
through these maze, agreed?

171
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,710
(all gasp)

172
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,380
So sorry, Megan.

173
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,880
I suppose it's just
a bit too cold.

174
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,520
Nice try you two.

175
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,100
But I think we'll have to
rely on Galaxy's intuition.

176
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Come on.

177
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,650
(Galaxy)
Another dead end.

178
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,820
I am sorry, Megan.
I feel so lost.

179
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,950
(Megan)
Welcome to the club.
We'll never get outta here.

180
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,830
<i>(Surprise)
I don't believe this.</i>

181
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,630
<i>Megan, Galaxy, giving up?!</i>

182
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,340
<i>Well, not me.</i>

183
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,960
This way.
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

184
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,930
I suppose we've really nothing
to lose by following her, what?

185
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:03,650
(gasps)

186
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,650
(Galaxy)
Oh, my stars! Look!

187
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,190
An abominable snowman!

188
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,270
(growls)

189
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,650
This is a surprise I don't like.

190
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,690
(growls)
