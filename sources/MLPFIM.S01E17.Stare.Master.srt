1
00:00:00,627 --> 00:00:01,788
Rarity: (harried) Where did I put that?

2
00:00:01,788 --> 00:00:04,063
Oh, I thought I already-

3
00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:05,944
Oh, and can't forget I've got to-

4
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:08,870
(whines) How am I EVER gonna get this done?!

5
00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:10,096
Sweetie Belle: Are you sure I can't help?

6
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:12,376
Sweetie Belle: I could-
Rarity: (interrupting) No.

7
00:00:12,376 --> 00:00:13,816
Sweetie Belle: Maybe just a-
Rarity: No thanks.

8
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:15,720
Sweetie Belle: How about-
Rarity: Just stand over there.

9
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:18,046
Sweetie Belle: But-
Rarity: Where you'll be out of the way.

10
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,779
Ribbon...ribbon! Where's the ribbon?!

11
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:24,033
Sweetie Belle: I got it!

12
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:29,350
Sweetie Belle: Whoa!
(Rarity gasps)

13
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:31,115
(spool impacts stand)

14
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,158
(stand wobbles)

15
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,458
(thud)

16
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,641
(fabric thumping)

17
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:42,214
(Rarity gasping as objects fly around, objects crashing into each other)

18
00:00:42,214 --> 00:00:45,999
(series of loud crashes)

19
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:54,079
Sweetie Belle: (sheepishly) Um, I-I'll just go stand over 
 there, where I'll be...out of the way.

20
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:56,216
(Rarity sighs)

21
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:03,646
(theme song begins) My Little Pony, My Little Pony, ah, ah, ah, ah,

22
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:08,104
(My Little Pony) Twilight: I used to wonder what friendship could be

23
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:12,098
(My Little Pony) Until you all shared its magic with me

24
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:14,374
Rainbow Dash: Big adventure
Pinkie Pie: Tons of fun

25
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,649
Rarity: A beautiful heart
Applejack: Faithful and strong

26
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:18,553
Fluttershy: Sharing kindness
Twilight: It's an easy feat

27
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:20,922
All: And magic makes it all complete, yeah

28
00:01:20,922 --> 00:01:29,188
(My Little Pony) Do you know, you're all my very best friends

29
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:38,058
Sweetie Belle: Won't you at least let me help you clean up?

30
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:40,084
Rarity: (flatly) No. You've helped me quite enough.

31
00:01:40,844 --> 00:01:42,042
Sweetie Belle: I'm sorry, sis.

32
00:01:42,423 --> 00:01:44,019
I just thought that if I could help,

33
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,000
I might find my special gift and finally earn my cutie mark.

34
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,036
Rarity: I understand, it's just that...

35
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:56,073
I need this time to fill this order without any...complications.

36
00:01:58,306 --> 00:02:00,030
(stand clatters into place)
Okay. All done.

37
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:04,076
Now, back to work. I've lost a lot of 
 time, and I cannot have any more interruptions.

38
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:07,045
(doorbell rings, Rarity groans)
(harried) What now?!

39
00:02:07,454 --> 00:02:12,042
Fluttershy: (flustered) Oh, sorry. I thought the "open" sign meant 
 you were open, but I must have been mistaken.

40
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,037
Rarity: (gasps) Fluttershy, forgive me!

41
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:19,020
I was so wrapped up in my work that I 
 forgot you were bringing Opalescence back from her grooming!

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,096
I just don't understand how you're able to do it!

43
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,098
I can't get near her without getting a swipe from her claws.

44
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:32,023
(Opalescence hisses, Rarity yelps)

45
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:36,041
Did you use...(ominously) "The Stare" on her?

46
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:39,029
Fluttershy: Oh, no! I wouldn't. I couldn't!

47
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:41,070
I-I don't really have any control over when that happens.

48
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,005
I-it just happens.

49
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:45,023
No, I'm just good with animals.

50
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:47,009
It's my special gift, you know.

51
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:51,008
Rarity: Well, you should have a picture of Opal 
 as a cutie mark instead of those butterflies.

52
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:52,085
Sweetie Belle: (excited prattle) Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh!

53
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:55,008
Maybe I can be good with animals, too!

54
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:56,066
(air whooshes as Opalescence slices)

55
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:59,030
...Or not.

56
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,030
(Fluttershy and Rarity laugh)

57
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:04,041
Rarity: I'm sorry I can't invite you to stay and chat, Fluttershy.

58
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:07,015
I've bitten off a bit more than I can chew with this order.

59
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,087
Sweetie Belle: But you're not eating anything.

60
00:03:08,871 --> 00:03:11,015
Rarity: No, Sweetie. It's an expression.

61
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:13,075
It means that I've taken on more work than I can handle.

62
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:16,049
I've got twenty of these special robes to make tonight!

63
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,081
They're due in Trottingham [Nottingham] tomorrow morning.

64
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:21,066
(fabric whooshes, harp flourish plays)

65
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:25,025
(Fluttershy gasps)
Rarity: See? I've lined them in this special gold silk.

66
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:29,037
It took SO long to make, but I think 
 it adds just the right touch. Don't you?

67
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:32,062
Fluttershy: These are lovely, but 20? By tonight?

68
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,034
How will you get it all done?

69
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:37,073
Rarity: Well, I, uh-
Sweetie Belle: Oh oh oh! Maybe I could...

70
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:41,068
(sheepishly) just...just stand over here and watch.

71
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,012
Rarity: I'll manage.

72
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:46,032
Fluttershy: Well, maybe I should get out of your mane so you can work.

73
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:48,093
Applebloom and Scootaloo: Hi, Fluttershy! Hi, Rarity!

74
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:51,021
Rarity: Hello, uh, girls...

75
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,069
Applebloom and Scootaloo: Hey, Sweetie Belle!

76
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:54,064
Sweetie Belle: Scootaloo! Applebloom!

77
00:03:54,638 --> 00:03:58,058
Scootaloo: You ready for tonight?
Sweetie Belle: Yep! Cutie Mark Planning Session is a go!

78
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:01,084
Applebloom: Tonight is the night we each try to find our own special talent!

79
00:04:01,836 --> 00:04:03,074
Scootaloo: Even if it takes us all night!

80
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:05,041
Applebloom: I'm ready! You ready?!

81
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,053
Scootaloo: Very ready!

82
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:10,012
All three: (shouting) CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS SLEEPOVER AT RARITY'S! YAY!

83
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,025
Sweetie Belle: And...look what I made us!

84
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:17,028
(trumpet flourish, Scootaloo and Applebloom voice approval)

85
00:04:17,277 --> 00:04:19,051
Fluttershy: What does that patch on your cape mean?

86
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:22,071
All three: (shouting) THE CUTIE MARK CRUSADERS! YAY!

87
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:24,080
Scootaloo: We're on a crusade, a MISSION!

88
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:26,043
Applebloom: T'find our cutie marks!

89
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:28,024
Sweetie Belle: Yup, and look. (lifts fabric)

90
00:04:28,237 --> 00:04:30,033
I lined them with this special gold silk.

91
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:35,034
It took SO long to make, but I think 
 it adds just the right touch, don't you?

92
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,006
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle: Ooooh!

93
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:41,098
Rarity: Sweetie Belle! What have you done?!

94
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:44,012
That was the last of the gold silk!

95
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:45,079
Oh, now I'll have to make more!

96
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,079
Oh, I hope I can make more...

97
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,037
I'm gonna have to work all night!

98
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:54,083
Which means, sorry girls. I'm afraid the Crusader Sleepover is canceled.

99
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:55,088
Sweetie Belle: What?!

100
00:04:55,875 --> 00:05:00,004
Rarity: I just won't have any time to watch you if 
 I want to get these robes delivered on time.

101
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:02,021
Sweetie Belle: But-
Rarity: (sternly) No "buts" this time.

102
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,017
I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle; it's just the way it has to be.

103
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:06,075
(Cutie Mark Crusaders sigh dejectedly)

104
00:05:06,075 --> 00:05:09,096
Fluttershy: I, uh, I suppose I could take them for the night.

105
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:14,038
Rarity: I couldn't ask you to do that.

106
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,021
Fluttershy: Oh, it's no problem at all.

107
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,038
Rarity: Have you...MET my sister and her friends?

108
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,025
"A problem" is all it would be.

109
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:22,054
Fluttershy: (cocksure) Did I have a "PROBLEM" with Opal?

110
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:24,092
You've seen how well I handle small creatures!

111
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:27,096
Rarity: I suppose that's true, and I DO 
 have a lot of work to do...

112
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,046
Fluttershy: Come on, it'll be fun.

113
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,029
Rarity: I assure you, they're quite a handful.

114
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:33,004
Fluttershy: These sweet little angels?

115
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:37,004
(angelic choir)
Rarity: Well...all right.

116
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:43,017
Crusaders: (shouting) CUTIE MARK CRUSADER SLEEPOVER AT FLUTTERSHY'S COTTAGE! YAY!

117
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:46,042
Fluttershy: So cute. Wait for me!

118
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:48,025
(Rarity groans pensively)

119
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:54,092
Fluttershy: Oh, won't this be ever so fun?

120
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:56,062
We can have a nice little tea party,

121
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:00,042
and braid each others' tails, and sit quietly and color,

122
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,033
and tell each other fairy tales, and-

123
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:03,058
(Fluttershy gasps)

124
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,025
(Cutie Mark Crusaders rush past laughing)

125
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:06,050
(Twilight grunts)

126
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:08,033
(Cutie Mark Crusaders giggling)

127
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,033
Twilight: Hello, Fluttershy.

128
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,042
Fluttershy: Oh! Hello, Twilight!

129
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:13,046
Where are you off to?

130
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:17,067
Twilight: I'm heading to the Everfree Forest to Zecora's 
 to get some of my favorite tea.

131
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,092
Fluttershy: (apprehensively) The-the Everfree Forest?!

132
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:22,038
(sighs) You'll be careful, won't you?

133
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,029
Twilight: Of course! How about you? What are you doing with the girls?

134
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:27,083
Fluttershy: Rarity has a big order to fill tonight,

135
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:31,050
so I volunteered to take the girls over to my cottage for a sleepover.

136
00:06:31,005 --> 00:06:34,054
Twilight: Wow, sounds like everypony has their hooves full today.

137
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:37,096
Taking care of those three fillies, all by yourself?

138
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:39,046
You sure you can handle it?

139
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,079
Fluttershy: What? These sweet little angels?

140
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,088
They'll be no problem at all.

141
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:49,092
(crickets chirping, owl hooting, Fluttershy closes door)

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,012
Sweetie Belle: Wow, look at this place!

143
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:57,012
(Cutie Mark Crusaders talking over each other excitedly)

144
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,067
Fluttershy: (frazzled) No...problem at all...

145
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,088
Okay, girls, what should we do?

146
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,012
Scootaloo: I'm gonna get my mark first!
Fluttershy: Girls...?

147
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,008
Sweetie Belle: Nuh-uh!
Fluttershy: Should we-
Applebloom: I AM!

148
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,050
Fluttershy: Girls! Okay, now, settle-

149
00:07:08,005 --> 00:07:11,012
Scootaloo: I'M staying up all night!
Applebloom: Me too!
Sweetie Belle: Me three!

150
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,084
Fluttershy: I know you're excited, but-

151
00:07:13,842 --> 00:07:17,005
(chair creaking)
girls, be careful with the-

152
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:19,032
oh, uh, girls...

153
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:22,011
(Fluttershy blows mane out of face)

154
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,036
Fluttershy: So! What do you wanna do? Play a game?

155
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,063
Scootaloo: We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders!

156
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:30,033
Applebloom: And we want t'crusade for our cutie marks!

157
00:07:30,328 --> 00:07:34,046
Sweetie Belle: (stumbling over words) And, and, and we, um...yeah! What they said!

158
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:39,057
Fluttershy: Um...I dunno. How about a nice, QUIET little tea party...?

159
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:44,086
Scootaloo: Or we could go adventuring in the Everfree Forest!
Applebloom and Sweetie Belle: YEAH!

160
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:49,065
Fluttershy: (ominously) Oh no! The Everfree Forest is MUCH too dangerous!

161
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:52,050
It's filled with far too many strange creatures.

162
00:07:52,503 --> 00:07:55,024
Sweetie Belle: But you could go with us and we could catch those creatures.

163
00:07:55,243 --> 00:07:59,014
We could be, um...creature catchers!

164
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:03,009
Crusaders: (shouting) YAY! CUTIE MARK CRUSADER CREATURE CATCHERS!

165
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:11,092
Scootaloo: Rarr! I am a dangerous creature from the Everfree Forest! Rarr!

166
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:16,070
Sweetie Belle: (playing along) Halt, dangerous creature of the Everfree Forest!

167
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:18,088
I am Sweetie Belle, the Creature Catcher,

168
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:20,051
and I'm here to catch you!

169
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:22,055
Scootaloo: You can never catch me!

170
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:25,034
I am far too POWERFUL and DANGEROUS!

171
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:27,038
Sweetie Belle: You cannot run from me!

172
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,096
(Scootaloo pretends to roar)

173
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,044
(Sweetie Belle giggles)

174
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,054
(Scootaloo pretends to roar and giggles)

175
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:35,004
Fluttershy: Um, uh, maybe that's not such a-

176
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:38,076
now, girls, how about we do some nice coloring.

177
00:08:38,757 --> 00:08:39,015
(Fluttershy yelps)

178
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,043
(thud)
Sweetie Belle: Come back, dangerous creature,

179
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:43,015
(table and pitcher clatter)
so I can catch you!

180
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:44,017
Scootaloo: Never!

181
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:49,028
(several crashes followed by loud crash)
Fluttershy: Careful...you don't...! ...break anything.

182
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:53,018
Sweetie Belle: (remorsefully) Sorry, Fluttershy.

183
00:08:53,177 --> 00:08:54,085
Scootaloo: Yeah, sorry.

184
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:56,096
Applebloom: (dejectedly) I guess we aren't creature catchers.

185
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,005
Fluttershy: Oh girls, it's okay, I-
Applebloom: I KNOW!

186
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:02,079
We could be Cutie Mark Crusader Carpenters!

187
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:04,038
Fluttershy: (apprehensively) Carpenters...?

188
00:09:08,177 --> 00:09:10,008
Applebloom: Hammer!
Scootaloo: Hammer!

189
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:13,075
Sweetie Belle: Hammer!
Scootaloo: Hammer!

190
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:16,021
Scootaloo: Hammer.

191
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:17,098
Hammer.

192
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:27,036
(hammer, saw, and jackhammer sounds)

193
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:30,014
Sweetie Belle: Um, THAT doesn't look like a table.

194
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:31,086
Scootaloo: (incredulous) We were making a TABLE?!

195
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:34,069
Applebloom: Somepony needs t'put this thing outta its misery.

196
00:09:34,694 --> 00:09:37,062
Scootaloo: We are definitely not Cutie Mark Carpenters.

197
00:09:37,062 --> 00:09:40,027
Sweetie Belle: (dryly) Who wants a picture of a hammer on their flank, anyway?

198
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:44,086
Fluttershy: Well, now that we've gotten that out 
 of the way, how about a game?

199
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:48,039
Fluttershy: It's called, "Shhh."

200
00:09:48,394 --> 00:09:49,065
Scootaloo: What's that?

201
00:09:49,648 --> 00:09:53,083
Fluttershy: Well, it's a game about who can be quiet the longest. Sound fun?

202
00:09:55,406 --> 00:09:58,075
I'm the world champ, you know. Bet you can't beat me!

203
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,084
(inhales sharply)

204
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,090
Scootaloo: I lose!
Sweetie Belle: Me too!
Applebloom: Me three!

205
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:07,004
(Fluttershy sighs)

206
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,071
Applebloom: Okay! Now what can we do?

207
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:12,024
Ooh! How about Cutie Mark Crusader Coal Miners?

208
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:13,026
Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle: YEAH!

209
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:14,033
Fluttershy: (loudly) NO!

210
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:16,000
Crusaders: Aww...

211
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:18,065
Fluttershy: I mean, it's time for bed, don't you think?

212
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:23,015
(motherly) Aren't you excited to get all toasty 
 and warm in your snuggly-wuggly widdle beds?

213
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:27,043
Applebloom: "...Snuggly-wuggly?" But we have more crusadin' t'do!

214
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,038
Scootaloo: We've got plans!

215
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:30,049
Sweetie Belle: And capes!

216
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:34,053
Fluttershy: Um, okay. Um, maybe the crusading can wait until morning?

217
00:10:34,532 --> 00:10:37,055
When it's light? And not so... (meekly) dark?

218
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:41,003
Applebloom: How are we gonna find our special talent in our sleep?

219
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:45,058
Fluttershy: (blows out candle) Maybe you'll have a 
 lovely little dream about your special talent.

220
00:10:45,584 --> 00:10:47,021
Scootaloo: But we're not even tired!

221
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:50,060
Fluttershy: How about I sing you a lullaby?

222
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:51,076
Crusaders: Yeah!

223
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:52,074
(Fluttershy clears throat)

224
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:58,008
(gentle lullaby)
Fluttershy: Hush now, quiet now
It's time to lay your sleepy head

225
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:03,046
Hush now, quiet now
It's time to go to bed

226
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:05,055
(music ends)
Sweetie Belle: I know this one!

227
00:11:05,554 --> 00:11:09,032
Fluttershy: Oh, how WONDERFUL! Why don't you sing it with me?

228
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:11,054
(Sweetie Belle clears throat)

229
00:11:11,544 --> 00:11:13,031
(drumroll)

230
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:17,021
(lively gospel style with backup vocals)
Sweetie Belle: Hush now, 
 quiet now
It's time to lay your sleepy head

231
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:20,041
Said hush now, quiet now
It's time to go to bed (holds note)

232
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,025
Fluttershy: (speaking) Okay, Sweetie, that was-

233
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,080
Sweetie Belle: Driftin' [Driftin'!] off to sleep
The exciting day behind you

234
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:29,054
Driftin' [Driftin'!] off to sleep
Let the joy of dreamland find you (holds note)

235
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:30,089
Fluttershy: (speaking) Thank you, Sweetie, um-

236
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:34,009
Sweetie Belle: Hush now, quiet now
Lay your sleepy head

237
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:40,036
Said hush now, quiet now
It's time to go to BEEEEEEED!

238
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:41,020
(music ends)
OW!

239
00:11:41,196 --> 00:11:43,005
(chickens clamoring in distance)

240
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:44,077
Scootaloo: What is THAT?

241
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:52,039
Fluttershy: (opens window, gasps) Girls!

242
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,090
Applebloom: Fluttershy, your chickens are on the loose!

243
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:58,019
(chickens clucking frantically)
Sweetie Belle: I wonder what could've caused it...

244
00:11:59,726 --> 00:12:03,058
Scootaloo: Don't worry, Fluttershy! The Cutie Mark Crusaders will handle this!

245
00:12:03,058 --> 00:12:06,064
Sweetie Belle: Cutie Mark Crusader Chicken Herders! YAY!

246
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:10,067
Fluttershy: No, I don't think that's a- ah, come back! Please!

247
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:15,052
(chickens clucking, Cutie Mark Crusaders giggling)
Fluttershy: Come on, 
 girls, the chickens are fine-oh, girls, um...

248
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:18,040
GIRLS!

249
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:23,078
(chicken clucking and flapping wings)

250
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:29,008
Fluttershy: Come on. In you go.
(chickens clucking)

252
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:42,092
There's some good chickens.

253
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:46,096
Okay, you three, isn't it about time you got into bed?

254
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:49,000
Crusaders: (pouting) But-
Fluttershy: (sweetly) Please?

255
00:12:51,924 --> 00:12:55,018
Fluttershy: So, no more crusading for tonight, all right?

256
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,075
Scootaloo: Yes, Fluttershy!

257
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:58,010
Sweetie Belle: We promise, Fluttershy!

258
00:12:58,101 --> 00:12:59,031
Applebloom: G'night, Fluttershy!

259
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:01,021
Fluttershy: Okay. Good night.

260
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:03,079
(eyes pop open in turn)

261
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:07,009
Sweetie Belle: (hushed) Okay, so what kind of crusading do we do next?

262
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:09,064
Applebloom: There's not much we can do from this room,

263
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:12,080
unless we become Cutie Mark Crusader Cottage Cleaners.

264
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,026
Sweetie Belle: No thanks...

265
00:13:15,026 --> 00:13:17,054
Applebloom: Well, we have t'think of somethin'.

266
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:21,030
We can't just waste this opportunity t'find out what our special talents are.

267
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:22,081
Hey, girls!

268
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:26,066
Look! Some of the chickens may have escaped!

269
00:13:26,661 --> 00:13:28,075
Scootaloo: Into the forest!

270
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:32,093
Crusaders: (whispering) Cutie Mark Crusader Chicken Rescuers are go!

271
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:38,078
Fluttershy: (relieved sigh, to self) It really wasn't THAT hard.

272
00:13:38,782 --> 00:13:42,026
I mean, all I needed to do was just show them who's in charge.

273
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:44,045
Nothing's gonna get past Fluttershy!

274
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,005
Good with animals, good with kids.

275
00:13:50,717 --> 00:13:52,016
(fabric stretches, rips)

276
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:54,001
Scootaloo: Wait up!

277
00:13:54,014 --> 00:13:58,047
(owl hoots)
Fluttershy: Mm, peace and quiet.

278
00:13:58,473 --> 00:13:59,077
(Fluttershy gasps)

279
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:00,080
(anxious) Too quiet.

280
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:03,044
(Fluttershy gasps)

281
00:14:04,556 --> 00:14:05,095
Girls?

282
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,006
Girls...?

283
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:12,017
Elizabeak! She's missing!

284
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:13,017
Girls?!

285
00:14:13,171 --> 00:14:14,092
(gasps) Oh, no!

286
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:17,083
They must have gone looking for my missing chicken!

287
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:21,083
Which means, they must have gone into... (gasps, gulps)

288
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,062
(quivering) ...th-the Everfree Forest!

289
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,004
Fluttershy: Those girls have REALLY done it this time!

290
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:31,075
They've really bitten off more than they can chew!

291
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:34,017
Oh, just like me.

292
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,038
I never should have offered to watch them...

293
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,025
(Fluttershy inhales sharply)

294
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,000
(owl hoots)
Applebloom: Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!

295
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,088
(imitating chicken clucking) Bawk, bawkbawkbawk, bawk!

296
00:14:49,882 --> 00:14:51,028
Scootaloo: What are you DOING?

297
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:52,099
Applebloom: Callin' for the chicken.

298
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:55,027
Scootaloo: That is NOT how you call a chicken.

299
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,087
Applebloom: (sarcastically) Oh, and you know how to call a chicken.

300
00:14:57,869 --> 00:14:59,050
Scootaloo: I know THAT'S not the way.

301
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:01,063
Applebloom: Then show me.

302
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,044
Scootaloo: I don't have to show you.

303
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:05,039
Applebloom: Yer just chicken!

304
00:15:05,392 --> 00:15:06,083
Scootaloo: Am NOT!

305
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:09,076
Applebloom: Oh, wait! NOW I know how to call a chicken!

306
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:11,048
(echoing) Scootaloooo!

307
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:13,047
Scoot-Scootaloooo!

308
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:15,089
Scootaloo: That's so funny I forgot to laugh.

309
00:15:17,095 --> 00:15:19,079
Applebloom: You also forgot how to call a chicken.

310
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:21,041
(Applebloom blows raspberry)
Scootaloo: Why, you...!

311
00:15:21,414 --> 00:15:26,068
(wind howls)
Sweetie Belle: Come on, guys! We're not gonna find 
 the chicken or our cutie marks by arguing.

312
00:15:27,684 --> 00:15:30,075
Applebloom: Maybe that's our special talent! Arguing!

313
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:32,084
Scootaloo: Is not!
Applebloom: Is too!

314
00:15:32,838 --> 00:15:35,086
Scootaloo: Is not!
Applebloom: Is too! Anything yet?

315
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:40,087
Scootaloo: Nope.
Applebloom: Darn. (both giggle)

316
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:45,084
Applebloom: Here, chick-chick-chick-chick, bawkbawkbawkbawkbawkbagaaawk!

317
00:15:45,842 --> 00:15:49,032
Fluttershy: (trembling) Girls? Girls?

318
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:52,053
(gasps)

319
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,034
Get a hold of yourself, Fluttershy!

320
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:56,099
Just put one hoof in front of the other.

321
00:15:56,987 --> 00:15:59,010
Fluttershy: (twig snaps, high-pitched squeal) What was that?!

322
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,014
(high-pitched scream)

323
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,046
Fluttershy: Twilight...? Is that you?

324
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:11,034
(relieved) Oh, Twilight, it IS you.

325
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,089
Thank goodness you're here. I need your help.

326
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,031
The girls are out here somewhere, and I'm afraid that they're-

327
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:19,000
(Fluttershy gasps)

328
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,009
What's happened to you?!

329
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:22,095
(Fluttershy screams, Twilight crashes into ground)

330
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:26,038
Oh no! If you've been turned to stone, then that means-

331
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:28,094
(gasps) Oh no! The girls!

332
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:31,054
Don't move. I'll be back for you.

333
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:32,098
(shouting) GIRLS!

334
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:35,035
Scootaloo: Is not!
Applebloom: Is too!

335
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:37,016
Scootaloo: IS NOT!
Applebloom: IS TOO!

336
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:40,004
Sweetie Belle: (exasperated) GIRLS! Our special talent is NOT arguing!

337
00:16:40,362 --> 00:16:45,007
Besides, what would the cutie mark of somepony 
 whose talent is arguing even LOOK like?

338
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:47,006
Fluttershy: (echoing in distance) Girls! Girls?!

339
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,001
Sweetie Belle: Fluttershy?

340
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:52,000
Fluttershy: Girls! Thank goodness I found you!

341
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:55,008
Applebloom: Fluttershy, what-
Fluttershy: (insistently) Girls, we have to leave the forest at ONCE.

342
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:58,000
Sweetie Belle: But we haven't found the chicken yet!

343
00:16:57,986 --> 00:17:00,009
Fluttershy: There's no time for that! There's a cockatrice on the loose!

344
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:02,008
Applebloom: A cocka-what now?

345
00:17:02,792 --> 00:17:06,008
Fluttershy: (rapid, apprehensive) A cockatrice! It's a frightening creature with the 
 head of a chicken and the body of a snake.

346
00:17:06,786 --> 00:17:07,008
Now, come on!

347
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:10,005
Scootaloo: The head of a chicken and the body of a snake?

348
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:13,000
That doesn't sound scary; that sounds silly.

349
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:16,005
Applebloom: Why, if I ever saw one o'those "cocka-thingies" face-to-face,

350
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,005
I'd laugh at how silly it was.

351
00:17:18,512 --> 00:17:20,008
Fluttershy: NO! NEVER look one in the eye!

352
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:23,007
Fluttershy: If you look a cockatrice in the eye-
Applebloom: THE CHICKEN!

353
00:17:23,714 --> 00:17:25,003
Fluttershy: Girls, wait!

354
00:17:25,293 --> 00:17:28,001
Crusaders: Here, chicken, chicken, chicken!
(chicken clucking frantically)

355
00:17:28,102 --> 00:17:31,003
(guttural growl)

356
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:33,009
Sweetie Belle: There he is!

357
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:36,008
Scootaloo: Two chickens?

358
00:17:36,787 --> 00:17:39,001
Applebloom: I-I thought only one escaped!

359
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:40,003
Sweetie Belle: Grab them both!

360
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:50,003
(guttural growl)

361
00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:51,009
(chicken-like roar)

362
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:55,001
(chicken clucks frantically, cockatrice lands)

363
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:00,000
(thud)

364
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:02,005
(cockatrice roars)

365
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,001
(Crusaders screaming)

366
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:07,007
(Crusaders trip and yelp as they crash)

367
00:18:09,202 --> 00:18:10,004
(Crusaders gasp)

368
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,001
Fluttershy: See? Now we have to-

369
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:15,003
(Crusaders scream very loudly)

370
00:18:23,946 --> 00:18:29,001
(cockatrice squawks)
Fluttershy: (sternly) GIRLS! BEHIND ME, NOW!

371
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:33,005
(cockatrice snarling)

372
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:36,002
(cockatrice roars)

373
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:42,000
Fluttershy: (stern, intimidating) YOU! Just WHO do you think 
 you are, going around turning others into stone?!

374
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:43,003
(cockatrice squawks in surprise)

375
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:46,005
You should be ASHAMED of yourself!

376
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:50,007
I have half a mind to find your mother and 
 tell her what you've been up to, young man!

377
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,009
(cockatrice snarls menacingly)

378
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:58,007
Now, you go over there and turn Elizabeak 
 and my friend Twilight back to normal,

379
00:18:58,683 --> 00:19:01,008
and don't EVER let me catch you doing this again!

380
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:05,001
(stone shatters)

381
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:07,001
Do you understand me?

382
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:12,009
(cockatrice whimpers)
(calmly) Are you girls all right? I was so worried!

383
00:19:12,894 --> 00:19:14,007
Scootaloo: Yeah, fine!

384
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:16,004
Sweetie Belle: Thanks to that stare of yours!

385
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:19,009
Scootaloo: You're like the Queen of Stares! You're the-

386
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:21,003
Crusaders: Stare Master!

387
00:19:21,346 --> 00:19:24,009
Sweetie Belle: We're sorry we snuck out of the house and into the forest.

388
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:27,004
Applebloom: Yeah. We'll listen to you from now on.

389
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:28,007
Scootaloo: We promise.

390
00:19:28,073 --> 00:19:30,004
Fluttershy: (wryly) Oh, you do, do you?

391
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:34,001
Well, you'd better, or I'll give you...The Stare.
(Crusaders gasp)

392
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:42,004
(all giggling)

393
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:46,000
Twilight: (dazed) What...what happened?

394
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:50,001
(chicken squawking)

395
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:54,005
(Crusaders giggling)
Fluttershy: ...And that's when it brought you back from stone.

396
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:57,007
Twilight: This is gonna make quite a letter to the princess.

397
00:19:57,685 --> 00:20:02,001
I was wrong about you. You certainly do know how to handle those girls.

398
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:03,009
Fluttershy: (modestly) Oh, I wouldn't go that far...

399
00:20:03,862 --> 00:20:05,008
Twilight: Hm? How so?

400
00:20:05,766 --> 00:20:08,008
Fluttershy: I assumed that I'd be just as good 
 with kids as I am with animals.

401
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:10,007
Boy, was I wrong.

402
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:14,003
I really learned the hard way not to 
 bite off more than I could chew.

403
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:17,007
Twilight: You and Rarity both. Good morning, Rarity!

404
00:20:17,747 --> 00:20:19,009
Fluttershy: Did you finish all those capes?

405
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:22,000
Rarity: (sighs) Just delivered them.

406
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:25,009
I have to admit, if you hadn't come along, I might not have.

407
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:27,003
Thanks again.

408
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,005
Fluttershy: Won't you stay for some tea?

409
00:20:29,543 --> 00:20:32,002
Rarity: I really must get back to the shop and clean up.

410
00:20:32,237 --> 00:20:34,007
Girls, get your things. Time to go.

411
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:40,007
(Crusaders giggling and chattering)
Rarity: (stumbling over words) Girls! Time to- GIRLS!

412
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:43,006
Your things! Girls...!

413
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:47,004
(losing patience) It's time to- (groans) GIRLS!

414
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:48,006
Fluttershy: (gently) Allow me.

415
00:20:48,063 --> 00:20:50,005
(clears throat, speaks softly and gently) Girls?

416
00:20:52,113 --> 00:20:54,009
Applebloom: Yes, Fluttershy.
Scootaloo: You called?

417
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:58,002
Fluttershy: Go and get your things. Rarity is here to see you home.

418
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,008
Sweetie Belle: Of course, Fluttershy! Right away!

419
00:21:00,082 --> 00:21:04,002
Rarity: (muttering incoherently) H-how did you DO that?

420
00:21:05,743 --> 00:21:09,002
Fluttershy: I guess I'm just as good with kids as I am with animals.

421
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:12,008
Crusaders: (talking over each other) Thank you, Fluttershy! Bye! Thank you, Stare Master!

422
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:18,004
Rarity: (sheepishly) O-oh, uh, speaking of which, I could 
 use your help with Opal...
Fluttershy: Of course.

423
00:21:18,421 --> 00:21:19,009
How about later today?

424
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,003
(Opalescence yowls irascibly)

425
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:22,009
Rarity: How about...now?

426
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:24,007
(Rarity groans in pain)

427
00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:29,006
(Opalescence meows crankily)
(Fluttershy and Twilight giggle)

428
00:21:30,031 --> 00:21:32,004
(ending theme begins) My Little Pony

429
00:21:34,443 --> 00:21:36,007
My Little Pony

430
00:21:38,785 --> 00:21:47,005
(instrumental)

431
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:54,006
My Little Pony, friends
