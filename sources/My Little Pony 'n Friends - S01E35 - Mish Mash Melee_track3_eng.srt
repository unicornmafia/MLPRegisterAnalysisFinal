I just can't imagine a better
day for playing polo, can you?

11
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,340
I've never been
very good at polo.

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,840
Polo is not difficult.

13
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,050
Keeping the ball in play

14
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,470
is a simple matter
of potential energy

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,610
meeting mass and being converted
into kinetic energy.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,850
Huh?

17
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,350
What Wind Whistler means,
Shady,

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,900
is just whap it
with your nose.

19
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,770
Here it comes!

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,370
Oh, oh, oh!

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,660
Uh!

22
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,900
No!

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,790
I'm just not cut out
for this stuff.

24
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,240
Come on, Shady!
It's not that hard.

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,790
You just have to keep
your eye on the ball.

26
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,330
I've got it!

27
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,350
(whistles)

28
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,560
I object!

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,170
The rules explicitly state

30
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,400
that the ball may not be
engaged by unicorn magic.

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,610
Don't panic.

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,810
I'll get it down...

33
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,690
As soon as I figure out how.

34
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,830
Perhaps I can be of assistance?

35
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,490
(chuckles)

36
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,410
I've never had one get
away from me before.

37
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,080
Uh-oh!

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,830
Hey!

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,960
Uh!

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,100
Where are we?

41
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,590
Anybody see our ball?

42
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,110
I can't even see my feet!

43
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,800
What is this place?

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,100
It is called
the Mystificent Forest.

45
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,970
And there are those who still
hold to the hypothesis

46
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,440
that a strange enclave
flourishes beyond.

47
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,640
Huh?

48
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,810
(sighs)

49
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,810
I'm simply saying
there may be other beings

50
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,450
who live in this forest.

51
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,820
(trembles)
W-w-what do you mean "beings"?

52
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,950
<i>Gnome-like creatures
called Dell Dwellers</i>

53
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,080
<i>who actually live below
the forest floor.</i>

54
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,960
<i>They are the caretakers
of the forest.</i>

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,670
<i>They do magnificent work</i>

56
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,800
<i>making rough lumps of rock
into the smooth stones</i>

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,670
<i>Danny likes to skip on the
lake.</i>

58
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,550
<i>And where do you suppose these
huge oak trees come from?</i>

59
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,270
<i>Were it not for the
Dell Dwellers,</i>

60
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,220
<i>the forest might not
have any trees at all.</i>

61
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,150
<i>They are very orderly and
well-balanced society.</i>

62
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,920
And they do all this work
without any glory or reward.

63
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,090
You don't think they're
dangerous, do you?

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,700
Maybe we've gone
as far as we should.

65
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,950
I want to go back.

66
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:33,700
Whoa!

67
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,390
Whoa!

68
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,770
Wait up!

69
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,390
Don't leave me here alone.

70
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,150
Whoa!

71
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,380
(giggles)

72
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,150
This is great!

73
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,290
Whoops!

74
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,410
Ouch!

75
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,250
(gasps)

76
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,090
Ow, ow!

77
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,640
(All)
Ow!

78
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,360
What have we done?

79
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,000
Frazzits!

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,340
Run! Hide!

81
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,330
Don't let them get us.

82
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,500
Ouch!

83
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,940
Oh, my!

84
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,640
What have we done?

85
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,360
(giggles)

86
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,730
Wind Whistler, quickly!

87
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,560
We must do something!

88
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,450
This is no time for frivolity.

89
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,540
These multicolored
protoplasmic organisms

90
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,660
are ruining the ecology
of this place.

91
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,410
Did I say that?

92
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,740
Wind Whistler!

93
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,260
What is wrong with you?

94
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,970
Look Fizzy, no hooves!

95
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,920
Shady!
Come down from there.

96
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,390
Okey dokey! Whoa!

97
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,310
Shady, this isn't like you.

98
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,430
And Wind Whistler
is acting so silly.

99
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,570
(gasps)

100
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,570
Those Frazzits are
mixing up everyone!

101
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,770
We must do something.

102
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,660
Sorry, Fizz.
You're on your own.

103
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,520
I want to check this place out.

104
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,040
Looks like I shall have
to take charge here.

105
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,130
These Frazzits must go
back into the barrel.

106
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,200
Uh-ho!

107
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,850
I appear to be making
matters worse.

108
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,890
My bubbles work!

109
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,030
But this will take forever.

110
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,850
And I do not believe my friends
and these creatures

111
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,120
can afford to wait that long.

112
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,730
Speaking of friends...
where is Gusty?

113
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,030
There you are!

114
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,530
What are you doing
in there, Gusty?

115
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,150
Hiding.

116
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,200
This is not like you, Gusty.

117
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,070
Come out of there now,
I need your help.

118
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,130
Now, can you make a breeze

119
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,670
and blow these things
back into the barrel?

120
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,380
Please, Gusty?

121
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,880
I'll try.

122
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,050
No! Not that way!

123
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,900
You're dispersing them.

124
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,220
Gently, Gusty.

125
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,140
Please!

126
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,320
Come on!
Just a little harder.

127
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,450
Shady, we need you to knock
the Frazzits into the barrel.

128
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,080
No sweat, Fizz.

129
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,420
Almost done.

130
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,710

149
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,450
Nothing happened.

150
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,950
Everyone's still the same.

151
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,450
"This side down."
Hmm...

152
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,630
Gusty, Shady, come here.

153
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,880
I need your help!

154
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,520
Help me turn this barrel over.

155
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,040
This is what is causing
all the problems.

156
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,970
Careful!

157
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,470
"This side up."

158
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,050
(gasps)

159
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,950
I certainly hope
this is correct.

160
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,540
We can't thank you enough.

161
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,160
You saved our Dell
and the entire forest.

162
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,210
Aw, it was nothing much.

163
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,250
That's easy for you
to say, Gusty.

164
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,750
But what really did happen?

165
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,550
Well, when we fell
into the Dell,

166
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,420
We, uh, we kind of knocked
over this barrel.

167
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,000
As long as the Frazzits
remain in the barrel,

168
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,900
the balance of
nature is preserved.

169
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,980
But we inadvertently released
them and upset the balance.

170
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,840
That's exactly right!

171
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,190
But Fizzy took control and
restored everything to normal.

172
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,410
(giggles)
I did?

173
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,350
I mean, how did I do that?

174
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,200
Balance? What balance?

175
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,740
What are you talking about?

176
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,940
As I said,
everything is back to normal!

177
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,700
(All laugh)
