Don't hold me so tight,
you're choking me.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,950
Sorry. Bushwoolie
not want to fall.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,760
Just tell me which way to go.

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,100
That way. Uh-oh!

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,290
Oh!

15
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,380
Oh no!

16
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,430
You will tell me

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,860
how to drain the magic
in the wands for my own use.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,450
Don't be ridiculous.

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,640
That could destroy
all of Ponyland.

20
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,370
So be it. Take them
to the lava pits.

21
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,370
(all gasp)

22
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,130
(both gasp)

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,700
Who are you?

24
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,420
Who are you?

25
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,910
I am Princess Tiffany,

26
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,490
a keeper of the magic wands.

27
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,390
At least, I was.

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,630
You're one of the legendary
Princess Ponies?

29
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,970
Yes. And we need your help.

30
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,840
Our magic wands were stolen.

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,220
Wait. You'd better tell this
to Megan. Come on.

32
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,600
(lava bubbling)

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,600
They can't throw us
into a lava pit.

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,400
It would ruin my complexion.

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,350
Let's play bounce, now.

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,700
Oh, boy, play bounce!

37
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,270
-Yeah, bounce. -Play now.
-Okay, bounce!

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,110
(bouncing)

39
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,840
(bouncing)

40
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,200
(grunting)

41
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,470
Now's our chance. Let's go!

42
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,510
No you don't!

43
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,680
-That was fun. -Do it again.
-Yeah. Yeah. -Yeah!

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,470
Quiet!

45
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,690
Huh...we've got to rescue
the Princess Ponies.

46
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,300
-Yeah.
-Rescue ponies.

47
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,950
-Yeah, sounds like fun.
- Yeah, fun.

48
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,560
Uh-oh!

49
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,640
Looks like we're the ones
who need rescuing.

50
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,230
You have a choice ponies--
jump, or be pushed.

51
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,250
(evil laugh)

52
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,070
(loud shaking)

53
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,080
(grunting)

54
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,210
(grunting continues)

55
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,930
All right. Everyone, run.

56
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,430
Don't mess with me.

57
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,840
I...I'm warning you.

58
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,860
Okay.

59
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,560
You asked for it.

60
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,330
Oh! He breathes flame.

61
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,650
He must be
one of the Lava Demons,

62
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,120
our hereditary enemies.

63
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,330
Uh-oh! I think
I just made a tactical error.

64
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,920
Hey! Wait a minute.

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,450
I'm a dragon, not a demon.

66
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,100
There's a big difference.

67
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,290
Would you be willing
to undergo a test to prove

68
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,790
you're not a Lava Demon?

69
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,970
Sure. You bet.

70
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,970
Uh, it won't hurt, will it?

71
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,230
Hey!

72
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,940
(teeth chatter)

73
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,360
It's true, you are not a demon.

74
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,780
They can't stand our touch

75
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,310
anymore than we can stand
theirs.

76
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,950
Listen, we need your help.

77
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,150
We've got to rescue the
Princess Ponies from...Lavan.

78
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,220
Lavan has captured
the Princess Pony?

79
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,740
This is bad, very bad.

80
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,010
I will help you.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,460
Come, there is no time to waste.

82
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,140
Oh, boy, are we lucky.

83
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,340
Paradise! You're back.

84
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,220
But who is this?

85
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,140
Megan, may I present
Princess Tiffany,

86
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,730
one of the keepers
of the magic wands.

87
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,510
Greetings your
majesty, I'm Megan.

88
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,440
Do you know what's causing
all these strange happenings?

89
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,830
It's a long terrible story.

90
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,940
And I'm so glad you asked.

91
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,280
It all started
when we lost the magic wands.

92
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,700
This is just awful,
all this mud.

93
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,170

110
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,740
There's more important
things to worry about now.

111
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,650
Look, everyone.

112
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,900
It's Spike!

113
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,270
Spike. Over here.

114
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,240
(Bushwoolies)
Hey! Princesses found us.

115
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,740
-No, found them. -Found us?
-Yeah. -Yeah -Yeah.

116
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,110
I'm so glad to see you.

117
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,360
You are?

118
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,580
Yes, indeed.

119
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,170
Now if only we can
find the magic wands.

120
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,950
Uhh, this is Gnash.

121
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,850
He...he says he can help us.

122
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,340
There are tunnels in here that
even Lavan doesn't know about.

123
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,590
We'll get the magic wands back.

124
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,770
It's worth a try.

125
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,890
Yeah, worth a try.

126
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,850
-What's worth a try?
-Yeah.

127
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,970
And so we need your help to
get the magic wands back.

128
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,640
This is serious, Megan.

129
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,600
The Jewel Desert is spreading.

130
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,480
Everything is
turning to crystal.

131
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,790
It'll reach Dream Valley soon.

132
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,390
Tiffany, I'll go with you
back to Royal Paradise.

133
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,290
The Rainbow of Light
is the only thing

134
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,810
that can restore
the magical balance.

135
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,460
There must be a way to release
the magic in the wands.

136
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,500
Maybe my own powers
are strong enough.

137
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,580
(screams)

138
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,170
It's working!

139
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,900
(evil laugh)

140
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,070
Master, what's happened to you?

141
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,150
I told you I was
not to be disturbed, Sludge.

142
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,080
What do you want?

143
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,770
Your pardon, master.

144
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,750
But the Princess Ponies
have escaped.

145
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,500
WHAT?!

146
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,710
This is silly. We're
going around in circles.

147
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,340
Hush! We're inside the
walls of Lavan's chambers.

148
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,690
He may hear us.

149
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,780
(evil laugh)

150
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,970
I can feel the power within me.

151
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,520
All my senses
have been sharpened.

152
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,120
(sneezes)
What's that?

153
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,080
(sneezing continues)

154
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,050
I thought so.

155
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,710
Guards.

156
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,910
(guards growl)

157
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,410
Seize them!

158
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,930
(groans)

159
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,470
-Our magic wands,
-there they are!

160
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,940
Not so fast.

161
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,610
We're trapped.

162
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,430
An Ice Org, eh?

163
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,750
I should melt you into a puddle
right here.

164
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,110
Wait, master.
There's no need for that.

165
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,990
Quiet, Sludge,

166
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,170
or do you want another dose
of what I gave you before?

167
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,120
Then throw them all
into dungeons.

168
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,920
I'll deal with them later.

169
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,790
I'm tired.

170
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,810
I don't know if I can make
it back to Royal Paradise.

171
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,680
You've got to, Princess Tiffany.

172
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,470
The Rainbow of Light may
be Ponyland's only hope.

173
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,850
Whoa! What's going on?

174
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,860
The magic's going crazy again.

175
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,110
Hang on!

176
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,570
Oh! No! The Rainbow of Light.
