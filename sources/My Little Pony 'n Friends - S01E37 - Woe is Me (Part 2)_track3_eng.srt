56
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,600
I'm sorry all these terrible
things are happening to him,

57
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,720
but I just don't see why
we should all suffer?

58
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,730
It doesn't have to be this way.

59
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,770
Golly!

60
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,900
It looks like
there was a fire!

61
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,780
Woebegone!
Where are you?

62
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,090
Woebegone!

63
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,000
Please! Come down before
you hurt yourself.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,870
What's the use?

65
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,370
I'm bound to get hurt
no matter where I am.

66
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,840
I just don't want you to.

67
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,370
So please! Go away!

68
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,510
(thud)
See?

69
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,100
No, I really don't.

70
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,600
Why is this happening to you?

71
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,300
The last time I tried to tell
you, Paradise Estate collapsed.

72
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,850
I hate to think what
might happen this time.

73
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,570
Oh, finish the story, please?!

74
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,810
Now let's see.

75
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,060
Where did I leave off?

76
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,940
Oh, yeah! I remember now.

77
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,790
<i>There I was...</i>

78
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,700
<i>face to face with the old witch</i>

79
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,150
<i>floating in a pond of her
potion</i>

80
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,070
<i>which I knocked us into.</i>

81
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,240
<i>My friends were in
no position to help.</i>

82
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,870
<i>Help!</i>

83
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,000
<i>Even if they wanted to.</i>

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,550
It was an accident.

85
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,890
It was just bad luck.

86
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,250
Things like this are
always happening to me.

87
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,380
If it would help any to say,
I'm really sorry.

88
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,650
Whoa!

89
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,520
Sorry?

90
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,010
You haven't begun to be sorry.

91
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,260
You say bad luck follows you?

92
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,110
Would you to be the clumsy
that you seem to think you are.

93
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,600
The world would
be a fearful place

94
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,110
for all folks near and far,

95
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,870
so arm yourself
with charms of luck

96
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,360
that may will serve you well,

97
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,860
for you crumbled your own cookie

98
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,540
<i>and your future
is in this spell.</i>

99
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,710
But, when you have a
change of mind

100
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,600
and believe your deeds
both good and true,

101
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,960
your small black cloud
will shrivel up

102
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,630
and the sun will shine on you.

103
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,610
That'll teach him a lesson.

104
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,950
A curse!
She put a curse on me.

105
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,140
(laughs)

106
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,400
(groans)

107
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,400
Ooh!
You should have seen him.

108
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,820
He just shoved that ol' witch
right in her own potion... Wham!

109
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,370
Oh, I didn't really.

110
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,970
It was just an accident.

111
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,540
Come, come my boy!

112
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,890
You're a hero!

113
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,210
Nah, I just--Really?

114
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,340
Absolutely!

115
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,980
What's going on?
What are you doing?

116
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,730
(wood creaking)
(thud)

117
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,070
Ah! Look what you've done,
you hooligan!

118
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,320
But I didn't.

119
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,940
Sure!

120
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,820
Just like you didn't push
that old witch in the soup.

121
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,660
You don't go messing around with
witches

122
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,940
without paying the price.

123
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,910
Now be off with ya...
Ya little jinx!

124
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,780
I guess I really am a jinx.

125
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,970
There! Maybe that'll
stop any bad luck

126
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,790
that might be hanging over me.

127
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,260
(thundering)

128
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,510
<i>There he is!</i>

129
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,390
<i>There's the little jinx!</i>

130
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,380
Woebegone, this is your fault.

131
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,860
I'd better leave before the
whole town floats away.

132
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,230
Until now, all anyone's
wanted to see of me is my back,

133
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,490
as I leave town.

134
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,480
We'll always be your
friends, Woebegone.

135
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,950
We don't believe in curses.

136
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,320
Really?
(thunders)

137
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,490
But maybe you feel just a
teensy bit guilty about

138
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,400
what happened to that old witch.

139
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,550
Maybe!

140
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,540
You've brought all that bad luck
down on yourself.

141
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,050
How?

142
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,970
Well, you believe it'll happen,
and so it does.

143
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,090
If ya stop believing it,
it'll stop happening.

144
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,730
Maybe that's what
the witch meant.

145
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,810
Your own bad attitude
brought your misfortune.

146
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,170
It even created that
little black cloud.

147
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,350
And when anyone felt sorry
for you and tried to help,

148
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,740
you believed it would be bad
for them and so it was.

149
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,160
The witch just brought
all your fears to life.

150
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,030
Maybe if you believe
in yourself,

151
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,520
only good things
will happen to you.

152
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,040
I am good. I am!

153
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,420


154
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,500
You must believe in yourself.

155
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,280
I am not bad luck.

156
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,260
I defy you to strike me.

157
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,050
I did it!

158
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,710
You sure did.

159
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,090
You overcame your
own worst enemy...

160
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,360
...yourself!

161
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,640
What do you want?

162
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,110
I wish to congratulate
my friend, Woebegone

163
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,900
and you as well.

164
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,780
You have broken my spell,

165
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:11,400
which means you have learnt a
great lesson about yourself.

166
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
All that you touch
shall be plagued no more

167
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,150
the evil be gone,

168
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,410
the good will endure.

169
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,390
Look at your leg.

170
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,660
The bandage is gone.

171
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,410
She fixed my leg.

172
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,640
She fixed my leg! Oh, thank you!
Yippee yahoo!

173
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,510
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Thank you!

174
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,640
All right. Let's go! Let's go!

175
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,770
Posies' garden's fixed!

176
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,020
Yippee!

177
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,190
<i>Lickety-Split, Lickety-Split!</i>

178
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,020
Why did you bring him back for?

179
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,940
I just had the nursery repaired.

180
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,440
He's not gonna hurt the nursery.

181
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,950
He's not bad luck anymore.

182
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,590
Look! No more
little black cloud.

183
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:05,710
And I'm not hiding it
under my hat either.

184
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,210
I'm cured of my bad attitude,

185
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,100
so now nothing bad will happen.

186
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,210
Well, I'm going home now.

187
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,460
If the witch's spell is broken

188
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,210
that means my village
has been restored.

189
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,110
Have a safe journey.

190
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,520
I will. Thanks to you.

191
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,350
(all gasp)

192
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,650
It's okay.
It could happen to anyone.

193
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,360
So he's a little clumsy.

194
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,310
Well, nobody's perfect.
