There it is!

12
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,510
Then that's where we're going.

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,880
(All gasp and scream)

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,550
Ice! Look out!

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,810
- Don't go near it!
- Cowards!

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,530
More of you?

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,220
No matter,
I'll deal with you too.

18
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,520
Wrong! We'll deal with you!

19
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,030
(struggles)

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,640
Everybody out of here, now!

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,910
Bushwoolies! We are leaving.

22
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,780
- You bet! Leaving!
- Outta here.

23
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,040
- Wait for me.
- Gone, Yeah!

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,990
No matter where you run,
I can find you.

25
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,130
I will find you.

26
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,250
It doesn't look good,
does it Wind Whistler?

27
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,080
No, the desertification is
proceeding at an alarming pace.

28
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,900
At this rate, it will consume

29
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,470
Paradise Estate
in a matter of hours.

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,100
Well, we've gotten away
from Lavan and his demons,

31
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,350
now what do we do?

32
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,570
The Moochick said we have to
find the Heart of Ponyland.

33
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,320
The Heart of Ponyland?

34
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,530
I seem to recall
an ancient legend about that.

35
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,400
I remember too.

36
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,120
A magical talisman
far beneath Lavan's kingdom.

37
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,190
What does it do?

38
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,660
According to the legend,

39
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,110
it's the source from which our
magic wands draw their power.

40
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,590
Maybe if we can bring
the wands to it,

41
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,510
we can recharge
them with magic!

42
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,370
Well, what are we waiting for?

43
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,620
Let's get moving.

44
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,870
What is it?

45
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,220
Master, we can find no trace

46
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,680
of the Princess Ponies
and their friends.

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,510
Incompetent fool!

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,220
(screams)
Ah!

49
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,390
If you want anything done right,
you have to do it yourself.

50
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,020
How are you Princesses
holding up?

51
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,650
Oh, well enough.

52
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,620
Considering...

53
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,060
Considering what?

54
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,240
Considering how ugly
these caverns are.

55
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,910
And that there are no
plants or trees or flowers.

56
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,130
And that...hm, sorry.

57
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,380
I didn't mean to complain.

(All gasp in amazement)

71
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,400
Now I remember.

72
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,980
According to the legend,

73
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,960
we have to lay
our wands in the crowns

74
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,330
and then their power
will be restored.

75
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,250
Well, no time like the present.

76
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,640
Oh, no!
It's Lavan!

77
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,580
Get away from there.

78
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,420
(All scream)

79
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,640
(All scream)

80
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,260
(Evil laugh)

81
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,180
Oh, with every new minute,

82
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,350
I learn how to control
my powers more.

83
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,070
You have no chance!

84
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,940
Oh! What's going to happen?

85
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,440
Lavan controls
the high ground.

86
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,410
He can stay where he is
and pick us off,

87
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,910
or he can come down and get us.

88
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,530
What else can he do?

89
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,490
He could give up.

90
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,760
(All scream)
Ah!

91
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,750
But I don't think
we should count on that.

92
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,010
I'm gonna make
one last surveillance flight

93
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,020
before we return to the others.

94
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,920
Be careful, Wind Whistler.

95
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,550
(struggles)

96
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,430
Wind Whistler!

97
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,030
Oh!
I-I can't move it.

98
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,270
Go get the others.

99
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,860
But there's not enough time!

100
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,360
By the time
I get back with help...

101
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,450
Ooh, we're done for now.

102
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,030
Lavan's going to destroy us all.

103
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,330
Unless we fight back!

104
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,820
How?
He's too powerful.

105
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,080
Here's my plan.

106
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,590
I'll distract him
while you and then we...

107
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,790
(whispering)

108
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,000
Ponies! Surrender!
And I might let you live!

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,890
Never!

110
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:46,890
(laughs)

111
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,260
If that's how you want it...

112
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,180
Charge! Bushwoolies!

113
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,480
(All)
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

114
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,350
Oh boy, Charge!

115
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,180
Yeah, Bushwoolies
like to charge.

116
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,500
Yeah, yeah, charge, charge!
Let's go! Yeah.

117
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,360
Uh-oh...

118
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,200
(Lavan groans)

119
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,080
Drop those wands!

120
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,280
Nah! I just made it!

121
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,860
(Bushwoolies taunt)

122
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,830
Get to the Heart.

123
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,180
I'll take care of Lavan.

124
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,520
(roars)

125
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,350
Yay!

126
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,690
Yeah, yay!

127
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,890
Uh-oh!

128
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,470
(ice crackles)

129
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,020
Stop!

130
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,700
Quickly!
We must work together.

131
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,830
(laughs loudly)

132
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,880
No!
No!

133
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,220
He's gone.

134
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,470
(tremoring)
(All gasp)

135
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,930
Yeah, and we will be too unless
we fix Ponyland's magic.

136
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,250
(tremoring continues)
Let's put our wands
together again.

137
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,480
(struggles)
Uhh! Uhh!

138
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,400
Wind Whistler, look!

139
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,440
What does it mean,
Wind Whistler?

140
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,940
It means everything
is all right now, Locket.

141
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,750
Oh, my, my, my!
Oh, this is powerful magic.

142
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,370
The most powerful
there is, Habbit.

143
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,010
Oh, well, Magic
can't fix everything.

144
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,970
Everything's back to normal.

145
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,270
I can sense it.

146
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,940
We could not have defeated Lavan
without your help, Bushwoolies.

147
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,980
(All)
Aww, shucks... It's nothing...

148
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,860
In return for your bravery,
we knight you.

149
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,360
Henceforth, you shall
guard these crowns

150
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,230
as we guard the magic wands.

151
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,320
- Wow! Yay!
- Bushwoolies like it.

152
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,910
- Watch 'em close!
- Yeah!

153
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,700
I will keep this last one,

154
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,550
in memory of the Bushwoolie who
was lost in the Jewel Desert.

155
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,040
Uh, does anyone have any idea
how we get out of here?

156
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,760
That's easy, Spike.

157
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,750
Goodbye, my friends.

158
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,100
Come back and visit
the new kingdom

159
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,470
of the Lava Demons
and the Ice Orgs.

160
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,910
(giddy laughter)

161
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,150
Well, the magic has been put
right in Ponyland again

162
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,030
and Lavan is no more.

163
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,920
Our quest is over.

164
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,030
We never did decide
who should be queen.

165
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,530
I know!
Let's all take turns.

166
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,420
- Good idea!
- Perfect!

167
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,670
(All giggle)
A terrific idea.

168
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,300
It's too bad
about that poor Bushwoolie.

169
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,040
It's also too bad that
I lost the Rainbow of Light.

170
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,540
We'll never find
it in the desert.

171
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,140
(gasps)
Hey, everybody, look!

172
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,010
(All gasp)
Oh!

173
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,890
Here, Megan, Rainbow of Light.

174
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,200
(sighs)
Bushwoolie bushed!

175
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,110
What for dinner?

176
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,970
(gobbling and murmering)

177
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,730
(burps)

178
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:36,370
(All laugh)
