Oh my gosh, what is that?

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,310

Stop, please.

00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,860
Look.

52
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,660
(howl fading)

53
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,780
Oh, I can't move.
Help me.

54
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,450
Who are you?

55
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,830
Oh, my name is Pluma.
I'm a Penna.

56
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,130
We're magical creatures.
We have the power to transfer...

57
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,460
To, er...trans...
Er...change shape.

58
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,290
Though I seem to
have lost control of mine.

59
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,930
Oh, there.

60
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,140
Then you're not a spirit?

61
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,770
Oh no! Dream Valley
used to be my home.

62
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,040
But today I came here
from a land far, far away.

63
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,810
Why did you scare
us all out of the house?

64
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,330
I...I got you all out?

65
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,540
Every one of us.

66
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,290
Oh, good.

67
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,540
Hey, what is this?

68
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,140
It's a trap.

69
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,340
Help!
Get us out.

70
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,340
Let us go, please!

71
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,920
This is probably
a practical joke, right?

72
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,900
I don't think so, Gingerbread.

73
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,940
Actually, I was... Well,
you see... I...

74
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,480
I was forced to
come here by Squirk.

75
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,950
Oh!
Who is Squirk?

76
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,360
The meanest thing
I can think of.

77
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,490
And he has been for about
ten thou...oh, er,

78
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,960
twenty hundred... No, it was
Well, a long, long time anyway,

79
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,500
which is when all this started.

80
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,040
Long, long before
you ponies lived here,

81
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,670
when all this land- every place
around here - was underwater,

82
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,020
and ruled by that slimy,
no-good Squirk.

83
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,280
Squirk was a tyrant all right,

84
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,020
an evil and nasty dictator...
oh, he was simply awful!

85
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,690
He didn't allow anyone
to say a word against him.

86
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,810
If they did, he used the
power of his magical amulet,

87
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,310
the Flashstone,
to punish them.

88
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:12,540
And he used it,
oh, mercilessly.

89
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,210
Oh, he was
just plain CRUEL!

90
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,330
(cackles)

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,130
(laughs)

92
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,190
Over the years,
the water mysteriously

93
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,080
sank back
into the earth.

94
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,570
Nobody knows why or how or...

95
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,270
That is, well,
er... It just started to go.

96
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,920
And soon, other creatures
came to live here,

97
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,870
including my kin, the Pennas.

98
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,250
Ruff, my grandfather,
was their leader.

99
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,380
The Pennas didn't
come to...to fight,

100
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,520
they simply wanted
a place to live.

101
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,760
But Squirk -

102
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,880
he didn't want the Pennas
living in the vicinity.

103
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,550
No, I should say not.

104
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,220
He wanted all the land
to himself

105
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,440
and so, using
his powerful Flashstone,

106
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,060
Squirk tried to chase
the Pennas away.

107
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,140
But my grandfather,
brave and tough as he was,

108
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,990
refused to be bullied.

109
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,570
Er... Huh?

110
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,330
Hey!
What? Whoah!

111
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,160
And, with great courage,

112
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,130
he took the Flashstone
away from Squirk.

113
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,910
He threw one half into
the deepest part of the river,

114
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,990
and the other half
into what came to be known

115
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,360
as Dream Valley, a place
Ruff knew Squirk could never go.

116
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,040
Squirk hid underwater
for years,

117
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,160
waiting for my grandfather
to get old, weaker...

118
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,180
Squirk didn't care.
He'll live for centuries.

119
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,450
Where's your
grandfather now?

120
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,760
Squirk has kidnapped him.

121
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,210
He's holding
grandfather Ruff hostage

122
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,130
to force me to
cooperate with him.

123
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,760
What does all this have to
do with us or Paradise Estate?

124
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,390
Uhh, well...
You'll see.

125
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,110
I'm so sorry, little ponies.

126
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,610
Oh, I really am!

127
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,450
I don't want to do this.

128
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,360
But I have no choice.

129
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,500
Eah! Eah...eah!

130
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,330
Uh...Eh!

131
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,640
Can't you unicorns

132
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,400
just disappear and re-appear
outside the net?

133
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,170
Yeah, then you can stop
that crazy bird.

134
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,440
No, unicorns can only
wink out through empty space.

135
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,810
Yeah, we can't wink through
stuff like this net, you know.

136
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,500
Then we'll never get free.
It's too strong.

137
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,120
Maybe I can untie us.

138
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,500
Try it, Buttons.
Hurry.

139
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,620
That's it, Buttons.
You're doing it.

140
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,870
It's working.

141
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,260
You did it.
Hooray!

142
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,380
One down, two to go.

143
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,380
Faster, Buttons.
Hurry.

144
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,680
Come on, you can do it.

145
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,850
Oh!

146
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,610
Oh!

147
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,660
Oh no! Our house.

148
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,870
Come on.

149
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,880
Pluma, stop.

150
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,830
Whatever it is
you're doing, stop it.

151
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,910
Stop!

152
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,090
Our house!
You're gonna wreck it.

153
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,180
(Gasp)
Paradise Estate!
