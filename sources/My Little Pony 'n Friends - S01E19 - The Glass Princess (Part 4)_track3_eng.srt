This isn't the way out.

00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,880
Shhhh...
Be very quiet.

<i>The best thing that bag of
flubber, Porcina,</i>

14
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,190
<i>ever did was to turn
Ponyland into glass.</i>

15
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,980
Ponyland!

16
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,940
Into glass?

17
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,820
And now it's all ours!

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
Yeah! And, we ain't gonna
share our new home

19
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,490
with nobody.

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,330
Look!

21
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:42,430
<i>(cheer)</i>

22
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,480
Oh, I just can't wait!

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,930
(cheer)

24
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,480
There ain't no place like home.

25
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,490
(All)
There ain't no place like--

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,770
What can we do?

27
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,270
I don't know.
I just don't know.

28
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,420
Let's go take
a look at our new home.

29
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,700
(laugh and cheer)

30
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,330
<i>This is so great home.</i>

31
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,340
My darlings!
What are you doing here?

32
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,680
Well, Molly and I followed
Megan and the others here

33
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,210
in hopes that we could help
rescue you.

34
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,630
I mean, I could help rescue you.

35
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,710
I mean, after all,

36
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,060
it was probably my fault
in the first place

37
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,300
that you were captured.

38
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,450
I should have stayed with you,
gotten help or something.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,390
Oh, no!
It wasn't your fault.

40
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,890
You couldn't have saved us
from the Raptorians.

41
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,070
Anyway, I think I just might
be able to help after all.

42
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,200
Did you ever notice how much
hair the Bushwoolies shed?

43
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,160
(All)
Yeah, Yeah. Shed!
Yeah, Yeah. Shed!

44
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,920
And how much it looks
like pony hair once it's cut.

45
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,790
(All)
Yeah! Yeah. Pony hair.
Yeah, pony hair.

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,140
If we use the Bushwoolie hair
to weave a fake magic cloak

47
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,000
and exchange it for the real one

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,140
maybe we can use the real one
to change the spell?

49
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,000
(All)
Yeah, yeah! Hair. Yeah, cloak.

50
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,930
To the weaving room.

51
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,270
(All)
To the weaving room.

52
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,640
- Hurray!
- Shhhh...

53
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,520
Okay, let's do it!

54
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,360
(snoring)

55
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,500
My beautiful cloak.

56
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,570
(snoring)

57
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,120
My beauty.
Beauty...

58
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,580
(snoring continues)

59
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,660
Shhhhh.

60
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,460
Ah...ah...ah.

61
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,000
Ah, thanks.

62
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,260
(Porcina mumbles)

63
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,880
Hmm... My lovely, lovely cloak.

64
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,520
(snoring)

65
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,220
What are they doing?

66
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,270
Shhhhh.

67
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,220
What do we do now?

68
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,720
Gusty, you stand on
that side of the bed,

69
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,990
Shady, on this side.

70
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,860
Molly, hold the torch up.

71
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,150
And I'll stand at the foot.

72
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,730
As soon as she moves, grab it!

73
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,250
Oh, oh, all these
wonderful mirrors!

74
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,070
Oh, I must be even
more magnificent than I thought.

75
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,800
(sneezes)

76
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,670
Sorry, I think
I'm allergic to pigs.

77
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,270
Oh, dear! Which one
is the real cloak?

78
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,640
Somebody is coming.
(indistinct conversation)

79
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,940
(All)
Hide, hide, yeah, hide.

80
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,230
(All)
Raptorians are coming.
Yeah, coming.

81
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,690
I hope this is it.

82
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,460
Porcina! Porcina!

83
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,700
Porcina!

84
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,920
The Ponies have escaped.

85
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,450
Oh, what is it, Shrock?

86
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,720
It's the Ponies!

87
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,920
Ah...Ah...Ah...

88
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,550
They've escaped.

89
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,440
Escaped?

90
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,800
You got to help us find them
and...and turn them into glass

91
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,680
before they ruin everything.

92
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,610
You're giving me orders now?

93
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,360
(sneezes)

94
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,980
Ponies!

95
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,320
Get'em!

96
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,410
Stop, before I turn
you into toads.

97
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,530
Oh, she's bluffing!
That's an obvious fake.

98
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,300
Porcina, turn 'em all into glass
before they ruin everything.

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,010
(magical incantation)
Kazeem! Kazaam...

100
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,810
Oh, oh!
Ah, I-I can't.

101
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,680
I can't.

102
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:52,260
The Ponies in my crystal orb
didn't seem real.

103
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,980
But these Ponies here,

104
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,980
these living, breathing,
trembling creatures of flesh

105
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,270
are alive,
just like you and me.

106
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,940
I don't have the right
to turn them into glass.

107
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,070
What!

108
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,870
Are you crazy?

109
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,740
They'll ruin everything.

110
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,450
Then give it to me.

111
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,340
All right, you little pests.

112
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,840
First I'm gonna turn you all
into glass

113
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,680
and then I'm gonna shatter
you one by one.

114
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,940
(magical incantation)
Kazeem! Kazaam!

115
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,180
Kazoom!

116
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,220
This cloak's a dud.

117
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,270
That must be the real one.

118
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:36,940
Get it boys!

119
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,230
(indistinct muttering)

120
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,480
Don't be afraid.

121
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,860
Huh?

122
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,790
(indistinct muttering)

123
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,240
(All scream)

124
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,880
Don't worry,
they never felt it.

125
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,330
In fact, they never
felt anything.

126
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,400
Not about you or me, not about
anything but themselves.

127
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,340
I guess I didn't see that.

128
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,890
I didn't see a lot of things
till now.

129
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,350
Well, there's still time
to put things right.

130
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,520
Let's get back to Ponyland
and help our friends.

131
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,080
Okay. In fact,
I'll lead the way.

132
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,340
(magical incantation)
Beem! Salaah! Sim!

133
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,780
(cheer and merriment)

134
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,120
Wait.

135
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,120
(magical incantation)
Kazoom! Kazaam! Kazeem!

136
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,140
(cheer and merriment)

137
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:56,350
You see, Shady, your bravery,
quick thinking came through

138
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,600
when we needed them most.

139
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,770
So don't you ever
underestimate yourself again.

140
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,290
(indistinct chattering)

141
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,950
Now well that cloak was probably
never a good thing for me

142
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,650
to have had anyway.

143
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,290
But what's to become of me now?

144
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,410
Bushwoolies think
Porcina not so bad.

145
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,960
Oh!

146
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,740
Why not stay with
Bushwoolies underground?

147
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,140
We need clever and
beautiful hair groomer.

148
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:28,830
(All)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

149
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,720
Beautiful groomer.

150
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,830
Oh, why not?

151
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,760
(All)
Bye, bye! Bye! Bye!
