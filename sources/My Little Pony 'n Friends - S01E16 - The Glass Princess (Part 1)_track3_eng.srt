(giggles)
Okay, Megan.

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,440
Perfect.

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,060
Oh boy, the Pony Olympics
are gonna be so exciting!

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,310
Come on,
you can do it.

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,490
Jump higher.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,730
That's it.

17
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,980
You've got to practice

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,530
if you're going to be
in shape for the games.

19
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,790
See, you can actually do
three in a row

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,250
if you pull up pretty fast.

21
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,840
Well,
you can try it if you like.

22
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,750
Okay,
let's run through it again.

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,270
Okay, Shady,
whenever you're ready.

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,140
Oof!

25
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,770
Try again, Shady.

26
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,160
And this time, the rest of you
follow after her.

27
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,400
(whistles)

28
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,700
Agh!

29
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,020
(All shout)

30
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,270
Ow!

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,830
(laughs)

32
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,200
Hey, what's that?

33
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,500
It sure is pretty.

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,870
Hmm...
Let's check it out.

35
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,920
Come on.

36
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,510
(laughs)

37
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,170
Ouch!

38
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,020
Who turned out the lights?

39
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,040
Huh!
Let's...let's--

40
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,520
Calling Porcina.
Calling Porcina.

41
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,480
Come in,
Porcina.

42
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,560
Oh, la de da de dae.

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,480
I'm so gorgeous...

44
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,990
Today!

45
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,800
Is this what you want?

46
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,620
Shrock!
Why are you interrupting me

47
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,640
when I have important things
to do around here?

48
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,380
Agh, showing me
pictures of goons

49
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,580
dancing around
in funny clothes.

50
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,010
Forgive me, your ladyness.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,720
But I thought you might
like this material

52
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,220
that the boys
are modeling for you.

53
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,650
No, no, no!

54
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,570
That's not it at all!

55
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,100
That's just ordinary laundry.

56
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,850
I need some magical material
to repair my beloved cloak.

57
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,150
It's becoming faded
and tattered.

58
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,620
Without new magic, I won't be
able to turn things into glass.

59
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,330
Kazim, kazam,

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,500
kazoom!

61
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,540
See, my magic is running low,

62
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,920
and without glass how will I be
able to admire my rare beauty?

63
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,440
You must find a solution!

64
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,460
Hey, how long are we going to
put up with this prima donna?

65
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,940
This spoiled princess?

66
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,310
Just until she creates
a new kingdom for us.

67
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,370
(laughs)
And no one else!

68
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,520
Right!

69
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,240
(All laugh)

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,560
(indistinct conversation)

71
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,630
He loves me, he loves me not.
He loves me, he loves me not.

72
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,660
He loves me!

73
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,910
Hi, Shady.

74
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,260
What's the matter, Shady?

75
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,330
(sobbing)
I can't fly like a Pegasus,

76
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,650
I don't have any magical powers
like Gusty and Galaxy,

77
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,340
and I can't even make it
through a simple jumping drill

78
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,930
like any self respecting
Earth Pony.

79
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,150
I'll bet everybody thinks
I'm useless,

80
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,600
and they're probably mad at me
for messing things up.

81
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,350
Oh no, Shady.
I'm sure they're not.

82
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,950
But the best way to find out
is to ask them.

83
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,070
Yeah?

84
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,420
Why not?

85
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,360
Oh, hey!
Watch it!

86
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,670
<i>(thud)
Careful!</i>

87
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,920
<i>(thud)
Ow!</i>

88
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,540
Oof! Ow!

89
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,780
Ouch! Ow!

90
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,370
Look at that.

91
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,180
Those are little ponies.

92
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,720
Did you see that?

93
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,610
Look, boss.

94
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,360
They're magic.

95
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,550
I think this is a jackpot.

96
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,440
(Shrieks)
Shrock, how dare you
interrupt me

97
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,570
with this image
of a bunch of ponies?

98
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,630
Wait a minute.

99
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,250
Oh, most fair mistress.

100
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,070
It is our belief that
the hair of these here ponies

101
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,590
possess magical properties.

102
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,460
Would that hair not make

103
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,340
a most delightful
replacement cloak

104
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,420
for your loveliness
if woven into a fabric?

105
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,800
(laughs)
Oh yes!

106
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,570
I must have that hair!

107
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,090
Return at once, for we must
prepare a plan for obtaining it.

108
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,570
Soon, my little cutie,
everywhere we look

109
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,530
<i>we'll see me.
ME!</i>

110
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,900
(laughs)

111
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,330
Oh, let's see
where did I put that?

112
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,190
(indistinct mumbling)

113
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,540
I know it's here somewhere.

114
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,350

00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,750

122
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,620

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,190
Gusty and Galaxy each have
their special talents,

134
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,610
Lickety Split is
a terrific jumper,

135
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,860
and you can fly, Heartthrob.

136
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,630
What can I do
that is of any use to anyone?

137
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,000
I know just how you feel.

138
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,770
Sometimes it seems as though
everything is going wrong.

139
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,290
Like, just the other day,

140
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,470
I wanted some triple fudge
nut caramel ice cream

141
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,960
and all we had was vanilla.

142
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,030
Hmm... This is delicious.
Do you want some?

143
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,520
- No, that's not what I...
- Practice makes perfect.

144
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,140
You simply just got to
set your mind to it, Shady.

145
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,640
I have been practicing.
I try.

146
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,320
Maybe you're trying too hard.

147
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,210
Maybe you need to
have a little fun,

148
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,070
have some excitement.

149
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,570
Like a lovely costume party.

150
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,460
Something glamorous!

151
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,710
What do you think of
my new dress?

152
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,210
Now be honest.

153
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,960
You don't understand.
I want to be useful.

154
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,810
I want to do
something important.

155
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,720
Oh, you're so serious.

156
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,840
You just need a little sunshine
in your life!

157
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,140
Oh, never mind.

158
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,920
Shady, wait.
Don't go away mad.

159
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,150
You can't give up, Shady.
(indistinct)

160
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,280
Hey,
what happened to Shady?

161
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,940
I don't know.
She was here a minute ago.

162
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,440
Boy,
how's that for gratitude?

163
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,240
