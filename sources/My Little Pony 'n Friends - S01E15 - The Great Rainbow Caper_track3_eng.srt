Look at that rainbow go.

11
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,790
Aha, just a couple more clouds

12
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,740
and we can start
picking the cherries

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,720
for cherries jubilee.

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,630
Yahoo,
nice job!

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,980
It sure was.

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,840
Okay, Rainbow of Light,
back where you belong.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,340
Oh, come on, Megan! Cut loose!

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,760
Have some fun with this thing!

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,730
Danny!

20
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,430
What's wrong with a little rain?

21
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,080
(All gasp)

22
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,520
I mean it makes things grow.

23
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,240
Maybe even little sisters.

24
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,670
Danny!

25
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,740
Portable weather.
Great idea, huh Megan?

26
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,750
Cut it out and act your age.

27
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,380
Hey, look, I'm sorry.

28
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,120
I'll put everything
back the way it was.

29
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,850
I was just foolin' around.

30
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,050
The Rainbow of Light is the most
powerful magic in the world.

31
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,940
<i>We can only use it
once in a while</i>

32
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,640
<i>and only for special things.</i>

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,940
<i>Okay, okay, I got it.</i>

34
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,190
Anyway, it's just as well.
The sun's out.

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,410
Get a load of this.

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,980
Say cheeseburger!

37
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,240
We can go up for a flight and do
aerial photography of Ponyland!

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,410
Terrific! Let's go!

39
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,630
Danny, you be careful.

40
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,960
We'll be fine!

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,220
Let's just go straight.

42
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,550
Sounds good to me.

43
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,180
That was straight?

44
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,650
Sure! But there's a
tail wind today.

45
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,900
(laughs)

46
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,520
Oh! This is so exciting.

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,980
It is! it is!
But just wait.

48
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,530
It's gonna get
even more exciting.

49
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,610
We're gonna be the most
famous gizmonks in the world!

The Rainbow of Light.

81
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,260
Yeah.
But we'll have to get it first.

82
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,510
Hey,
did you see that?

83
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,370
Uh-huh!
And look!

84
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,690
Those two are with a girl
who had the rainbow.

85
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,550
Execute plan A.

(laughs)

87
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,850
That was the best landing
we've had, yet.

88
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,360
Yeah. Well, I still think
I'm going to make you

89
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,620
a saddle with seat belts.

90
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,560
Where did this come from?

91
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,560
I think maybe where
that thing came from?

92
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,810
Ah... Nice monster...

93
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,240
(screams furiously)

94
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,040
Is this the sort
of the adventure?

95
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,870
I'll get back to you on that.

96
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,460
What a mess!

97
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,330
All right strangers.

98
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,910
You are prisoners
and resistance is useless.

99
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,230
Give us that!

100
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,380
Why should I?

101
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,390
(screams furiously)

102
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,760
Oh...why shouldn't I?
Here.

103
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,580
- Trash.
- Garbage.

104
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,400
Useless!

105
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,200
Wait a minute! Not the walkman!
No! It's a computer! Don't!

106
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,330
But no luck.
So...

107
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,440
Time to send a message.

108
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,290
Drudge! Drudge!

109
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,580
Yes sir.
Yes ma'am.

110
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,340
You have to go to Dream Valley

111
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,210
and tell the girl
with the locket

112
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,720
that her brother
and his pony friend

113
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,620
are going to be held here
until they give us the locket

114
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,520
with the Rainbow of Light.

115
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,630
Yes, sir.
Yes, ma'am.

116
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,960
Whatever you say.

117
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,780
And in the meantime...

118
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,470
Wow!
Look at that!

119
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,640
It won't be long, now.

120
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,220
We gotta find a way
out of this place.

121
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,540
But how? We're sealed in
and locked up!

122
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,400
Listen!
(whispers)

123
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,650
(laughs)

124
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,250
Last one, Megan.

125
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,540
Thanks, Gusty!

126
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,790
It went fast with your help.

127
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,040
Megan!

128
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,240
There's someone
who's asked to see you.

129
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,590
It's something about Danny.

130
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,130
What is it?

131
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,140
The Great Gizmonks,
Gock and Gluda have sent me

132
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,230
to tell you that they have your
brother and the pony, Surprise

133
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,590
and will give them back to you

134
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,390
when you give them
the Rainbow of Light.

135
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,680
Go home and tell
the Great Gizmonks

136
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,890
that I'll get back to them.

137
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,320
Eh, fine!

138
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,930
But, Megan...

139
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,600
Wind Whistler,
quick, follow her!

140
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,940
And as soon as we know
where these gizmonks are

141
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,150
we'll figure out
how to rescue them.

142
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,530
Boy!

143
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,340
You guys have some really
awesome techno-stuff in here!

144
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,830
Yeah! Awesome!

145
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,500
My!
Very perceptive of you!

146
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,370
I really like that
sub-etheric discombobulator

147
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,260
you have over there.

148
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,010
Well, eh,
how nice.

149
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,640
And that whistle!

150
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,350
A ant whistle.

151
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,470
Yeah, it's radical.

152
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,440
Really terrific!

153
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,520
(both)
You think so?

154
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,460
Oh! we could really
learn a lot from you.

155
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,320
Ahh!
Drudge is back!

156
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,320
Whoa!

157
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,580
Hiya, Drudge!

158
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,580
Are you all right?

159
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,630
What about the girl?

160
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,310
She said she's thinking it over

161
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,550
and she'll get
right back to you.

162
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,930
Oh, all right.

163
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,140
Drudge! Let them out.

164
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,010
But don't you
touch anything.

165
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,340
Oh, no!
We won't touch anything.

166
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,490
All this must have taken
years to put together.

167
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,780
(lever creaks)

168
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,070
(wheels ratchet)

169
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,070
(siren whistles)

170
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,370
(alarm rings)

171
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,590
No, no, no, no, no,
you mustn't!

172
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,350
Oh, look at this
terrific experiment!

173
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,370
Oh, look out!

174
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,770
(indistinct muttering)

175
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,880
(giggles)

176
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,540
You're doing this
in purpose.

177
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,560
We sure are.

178
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,380
We're gonna blow this joint.

179
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,380
Please take me with you.

180
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,650
(indistinct muttering)

181
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,270
The creature went in there,
Megan.

182
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,230
We're never going to
break into that place.

183
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,950
And what are those
strange noises?

184
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,210
Let's go down there.

185
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,780
Hey! Can you tell me
what this is over here?

186
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,130
Well, certainly.

187
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,740
(multiple overlaying
strange noises)

188
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,880
All right!

189
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,080
Thanks very much!

190
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,660
And that was all
I wanted to know!

191
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,310
Oh! No!

192
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,720
No rainbow is worth this!

193
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,840
Look!
Are they attacking us?

194
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,420
I don't think so!

195
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,100
Take them home!

196
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,060
Take them home!

197
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,840
My goodness!

198
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,190
Oh! No!

199
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,480
Hi, Megan!

200
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,350
What have you two been up to?

201
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,680
Being irresponsible.

202
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,450
In a responsible way!

203
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,520
(laugh)

204
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,170
(babbles)

205
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,990
Hey, Drudge, you okay?

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,870
Yes, thanks to you two.

207
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,910
You've set us free
from the gizmonks.

208
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,430
And after we rebuild this place,

209
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,500
we'll start making some
really useful things.

210
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,260
We'll help you anyway we can.

211
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,020
Well if Gluda and Gock
come back,

212
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,760
just lend us these
two heroes again.

213
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,630
Huh-oh, it was nothing.

214
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,510
We would've
done it for anybody.

215
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,140
(laugh)

216
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,110
Well, let's get home
before we miss

217
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,970
all that cherries jubilee.

218
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,850
Yum! I forgot.

219
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,730
Right. Heroes first.
(tremoring)

220
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,530
(All laugh)
