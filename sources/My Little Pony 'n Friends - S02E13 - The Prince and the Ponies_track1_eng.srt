00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,450
"You are cordially invited
to a weekend traleigh."

Aww...

15
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,790
Newborn twins get to go
and we don't.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,470
The party is for them
Baby Tic-Tac-Toe.

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,020
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,280
Newborn twins get
all the attention.

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,770
I say we do somethin' about it.

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,650
Well, we're all set
for the palace.

21
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,450
Look at me.

22
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,710
Quack!
I'm a duck.

23
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,730
(All gasp)
(loud crash)

24
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,870
Baby Quacker,

25
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,710
why are you going to
all this trouble?

26
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,630
'Cause only babies
get noticed 'round here,

27
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,000
are newborn twins.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,500
(babies cooing)

29
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,330
Newborn babies

30
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,850
need a lot of attention,
Baby Quacker.

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,060
It doesn't mean we love 'em
any more than we love you.

32
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,830
Ah! The Little Ponies!
Entrer!

33
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,100
Have you ever seen
anything so glamorous?

34
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,750
Not since I looked in the mirror
this morning, darling.

35
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,790
A bedroom has been
prepared for you.

36
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,660
Dinner is at 8 sharp.

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,530
Bedroom?

38
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,420
This is more like a barn!

39
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,590
Pretty sumptuous for a barn,
if you ask me.

40
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,760
Pooh...
Too showy for my taste.

41
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,760
(laughs)
<i>(footsteps)</i>

(gasps)

43
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,550
Have you seen my brother?

44
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,110
Can you help me rescue him?

45
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,630
Uh, we just got here.

46
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,450
Zey took him two years ago.

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,100
<i>(knocking)</i>

48
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,440
<i>Where'd she go?</i>

49
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,990
<i>There's something fishy
going on here.</i>

50
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,320
Dinner is served.

51
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,820
My Poochy wants filet mignon.

52
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,950
But of course,
Duchess, Monsieur.

53
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,920
It will be done tout suite.

54
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,290
Never mind that, just be quick!

55
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,540
Ah, mama,

56
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,810
I wish I could have ze nice pet
like what you got.

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,420
Ah, my petite-fille,
you will very soon.

58
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,840
(clears throat)
Good evening, Duchess.

59
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,140
Who let those horses in here?

60
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,350
But mama,
zose are ze Little Ponies!

61
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,350
Oh, yeah, right.
(chuckles)

62
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,850
Bonjour, Ponies.

63
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:14,980
We're honored, your High--

64
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,000
Good.
Let's get some grub,

65
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,320
I'm starvin'.

66
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,340
I need more cushions.

67
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,000
You see, ever since the
Duchess took ze zrone--

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,610
Watch it, buster!

69
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,040
Oh, dear, oh dear, excuse moi.

70
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,180
I mean since the Duchess
ascended to ze zrone--

71
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,420
Never mind.

72
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,630
I'm just happy

73
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,770
that the toot-sweet
Little Ponies are here

74
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,880
with their dear newborn twins.

75
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,210
(babies cooing)

76
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,970
Oh, but they're tired.

77
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,470
Take them to the Ponies' rooms.

78
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,690
By the way,

79
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,110
there was a strange
girl in our rooms earlier.

80
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,450
I thought you locked
Suzette in her room?

81
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,110
Uh, she must have escaped

82
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,080
thorough another secret passage.

83
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,870
You must've been seeing things.
(chuckles)

84
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,790
Shall we dine?

85
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,990
(chomps and chews)

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,890
I was not seeing things.

87
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,550
Watch yer' mouth, sister!

88
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,410
You could be put out
to pasture, you know.

89
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,890
Ah! Me got great idea!

90
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,430
Let's go to dumb ol' palace
and crash their dumb ol' party.

91
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,930
I-I don't think that's wise!

92
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,760
But if you're gonna go,

93
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,740
I'm going with ya.

94
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:37,230
I learned one thing tonight,

95
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,330
being upper class
doesn't make you classy.

96
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,440
Ooh, I can't wait to get
out of this dreadful place.

97
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,580
I say we just take the
newborn twins and--

98
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,330
(gasps)
The twins! They're gone!

99
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,200
Come on,
they couldn't have gone far!

100
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Maemoiselles,
you are all under arrest.

This is awful!

126
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,410
We gotta rescue
the newborn twins!

127
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,760
<i>Good luck.</i>

128
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,030
I know every joist and timber
of this palace.

129
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,850
And there's no way
out of this dungeon.

130
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,510
I'm
the Prince Philippe de Branforr.

131
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,090
This is my palace.

132
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,840
Sorry, the accommodations
are unpleasant.

133
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,720
But the place has gone to seed

134
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,210
since my scullery maid
usurped the throne.

135
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,860
The Duchess is your cook?

136
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,720
Huh! I knew it!

137
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,970
You must help us.

138
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,530
The problem is getting through
that door.

139
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,540
You need ze key.

140
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,780
And ze key
is on ze guard's belt.

141
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,230
Buttons, can you get them?

142
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:47,860
I think so.

143
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,200
(snores)

144
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,900
No good.

145
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,550
The belt!

146
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,830
(gate slams)

147
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,930
Oh, me, oh!

148
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,260
Ouch!

149
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
This way.

150
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,530
(groans)
Doh!

151
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,700
Oh, there is no way in.

152
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,940
Let's go home?

153
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,860
Me think hard enough,
there be way in.

154
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,790
See?

155
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,790
You must come with me.

156
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,030
This tunnel should
lead right to...

157
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,010
the palace guard.

158
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,680
(in French)
Alons, vite, vite!

159
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,300
Regarde! Look!

160
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,540
(All gasp)

161
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,770
(Ponies scream)
Ooh! I'm so happy to have
ze pets like mama,

162
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,980
and we have
so much fun togezer.

163
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,720
(Ponies continue to scream)
No, no, Tumbleweed,

164
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,220

165
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,620

166
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,030
Only now me not feel good

(gasps)
The guards! We must run.

169
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:18,700
We gonna let dumb guards
stop us from savin' newborns?

170
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,970
(All)
No!

171
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,340

Well done!
Splendid!

176
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,980
<i>(Suzette)
Philippe, you're free!</i>

177
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,310
Suzette, you're safe.

178
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,080

179
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,320

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,110
To Margette's room.

188
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,350
(baby ponies crying)

189
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,610
Forget those bratty ponies.

190
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,530
We gotta get the prince
back in the dungeon.

191
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,870
<i>(Philippe)
Too late, Duchess.</i>

192
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,610

Let them.

Seize them.
Seize them all.

195
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,700
Take a good look
at your Duchess.

196
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,200
This is how she treats innocent,

197
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,080
defenseless babies.

198
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,470
Men, who's side will you choose?

199
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,300
Hers, or zat of your true
rightful prince?

200
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,150
(All)
Long live Prince Philippe!

201
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,640
(All cheer)
Alore!

202
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,140
And you, Duchess,
can have your old job back...

203
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,520
in the scullery!

204
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,270
You had to have a pet,
didn't you?

205
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,070
Little Ponies, you helped
restore me to my throne.

206
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,160
I owe you a great debt.

207
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,740
I'd say we're about even...

208
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,870
(All laugh happily)
