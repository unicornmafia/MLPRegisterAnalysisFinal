Well, how about that!

15

Aren't they the strangest
looking creatures?

16

They're strange all right,
strange as in ugly!

Never mind that, Whizzer.

18
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:14,950
We'd better do something...

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,530

Ahem!

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,880
May I speak to you a moment?

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,050
I said I'd like to
speak to you for a...

24
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,250
Sorry ma'am, no time.
Gotta find the Flories.

25
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,420
Captain's right, ma'am.

26
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,250
Those Flories could
be hiding anywhere,

27
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,730
even in...here.

28
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,650
Now you stop that
right this instant.

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,890
You heard the Captain, ma'am.

30
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,490
Can't stop now.

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,230
(sighs)
But-but...this is no
way to find anything.

32
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,930
We gotta get help!

33
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,410
Yeah! We gotta find Megan.

34
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,860
(panting)

35
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,450
Feels like we've been
running for days.

36
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,690
Oh!

37
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,440
Ooh!
We have!

38
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,170
(both panting)

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,630
Come on! Hurry! Soil.

40
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,040
Gotta find some
rich fertile soil.

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,010
And water!

42
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,040
Can't go another
step...without water.

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,180
Look, we're saved!

44
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,050
Rich soil!

45
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,620
Oh! Yeah! We're saved.
Oh..oh boy, oh boy.

(continues panting)

48
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:33,940
Just hold it.

49
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,460
No!

50
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,200
There's some kind of
creature in there.

51
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,880
(bird chirps)

52
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,320
It...It seems nice,
whatever it is!

53
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,390
I think it likes flowers.

54
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,580
An-and it has water!

55
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,580
If that creature cared
for us like that,

56
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,100
we'd be-be-be-be back on our
roots in no time.

(giggles)

58
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,170
Wait! It doesn't know us.

59
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,440
We've got to be careful
not to frighten it.

60
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,680
Yeah!

61
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,230
Follow me!

62
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,760

Can't talk.

90
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,320
Need water, fertile soil.

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,070
- Help! Need water.
- Fertile soil!

92

You poor things.

93
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,830
You're half-starved.
How can I help?

Posey, who're you talking to?

103
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,400
Megan, Cherries Jubilee, hi!

104
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,530
Oh, now I see.

105
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,440
You're planting
some new flowers.

106
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,230
They're pretty.

107
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,780
They look pretty sick to me.

108
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:30,710
Oh, yeah! You don't look
so hot yourself you...

109
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,000
You...you move! You talk!

110
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,460
What are you?

111
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,290
Flories, from far away.

112
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,560
Chased here.

113
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,300
They're trying to hurt us.

114
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,060
Who is?

115
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,300
Terrible creatures.

116
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,640
Crab Nasties.

117
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,220
Crab Nasties?

118
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,170
Ohh, they sound icky.

119
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,150
Shame on them, mistreating
such lovely flowers as you.

120
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,160
Why are these Crab Nasties
after you?

121
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,680
They're mean and nasty.

122
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,850
They've driven us from our home
on the other side

123
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,440
of the big lake.

124
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,520
They tried to capture us.

125
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,330
But we escaped.

126
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,040
And they've come after us.

127
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,610
to hunt us down and enslave us.

128
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,760
We've suffered so
at their hands.

129
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,870
You mean at their claws!

130

You've seen them?

133

Yes!

134
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,840
And we think they're
headed this way.

135
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,970
Woe is us!
Help us! Help us!

136
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,530
Don't worry, you
poor little things.

We'll protect you.

138
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,270

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,450
We were after them
because we're police

167
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,330
and they are escaped convicts.

168
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,580
That's right, ma'am.

169
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,710
<i>Ma'am, they ruin the soil.</i>

170
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,910
(rock gate rumbles)

171
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,090
There'll be
nothing left but brown dirt.

172
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,420
I can't believe you.

173
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,640
The Flories haven't
done any damage,

174
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,720
but you, you went and
trampled my garden.

175
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,100
I don't know.

176
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,480
I'm getting a bad
feeling about this.

177
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,600
I think I'd better keep an
eye on those Flories.

178
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,200
(snore)

179
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,910
Are...are they gone?

180
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,770
Would you relax?

181
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,040
(chuckles)

182
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,740
What a sweetheart setup!

183
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,840
<i>Thanks to those
four-legged suckers,</i>

184
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,370
<i>the long claws of
the law are trapped</i>

185
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,500
<i>where they can't give
us anymore grief.</i>

186
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,770
<i>All this land is ours!</i>

187
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,510
<i>Yeah, this garden is
only an appetizer.</i>

188
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,380
(chuckles)

189
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,460
So what are we waiting for?

190
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,310
Come on! Dig in!

191
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,190
(gulping sound)

192
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,650
Yeah!

193
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,990
Hey! Whose hogging all
the magnesium?

194
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,710
Leave some for me.

195
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,550
Say, get your elbow
out of my face!

196
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,380
Spread out!

197
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:58,180
(Flories sprawl)

198
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,340
(twig snaps)

199
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,670
Well, well, well!

200
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,930
Looks like one of those

201
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,940
multi-colored dingbags
is smarter than we thought.

202
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,520
I guess this'll teach ya
who to root for, huh?

203
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,170
(laughs)
