whatever they're called.

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,750
Ponies.

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,700
Who cares?

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,840
This one's no threat to us now!

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,450
But we'd better
take her with us.

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,050
So she can't tell her
friends what she's seen.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,590
Right. We can't let them keep us
from devouring their land,

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,520
can we?
(all chuckle)

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,190
This garden was
only an appetizer.

20
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,950
Yeah! Haven't you seen all the
green hills around here?

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,190
What a main course.

22
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,150
Oh, no!

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,570
So the Crab Nasties
were right after all.

24
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,990
Ohh! It's been so long

25
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,460
since we've chowed down
the way we did back there.

26
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,470
Yeah. I'd almost forgotten
how sleepy it makes us.

27
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,810
What about her?

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
She won't go anywhere,

29
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,320
now that she's put down
some roots.

30
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,010
(All chuckle)

31
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,510
(All snore)

32
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,260
(struggling)

33
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,360
(struggling)
Psst!

34
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,600
Don't worry, Masquerade.

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,820
Whizzer!

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,900
I'll have you outta there
in a flash.

37
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,660
(snoring)
Shhhhh!

38
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,500
(grunts and groans)

39
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,010
Whew.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,170
(snores)

41
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,630
Those rotten Flories,
they lied to us.

42
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,050
Wait till I get my hooves
on those...

43
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,360
Whoa, there!
They're too big for us.

44
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,610
We need help.

45
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,120
Only the Crab Nasties
know how to handle them.

46
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,560
Oh, no!

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,640
We locked the good guys in jail!

48
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,460
Hello?

49
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,980
Hello?

50
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,470
I knew it.

51
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,340
I just knew this would happen.

52
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,840
I just knew they'd
escape some way.

53
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,170
Look at that!

54
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,100
We still gotta find them.

55
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,600
And for that, we need help.

56
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,330
(sobbing)

57
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,280
Oh, my poor, poor darlings...

58
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,450
and the Flories...

59
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,030
gone.

60
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,180
Maybe the Crab Nasties got free.

61
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,620
Oh, of course.

62
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,520
That m-must be it.

63
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,760
No, Posey.

64
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,630
It was the Flories.

65
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,110
Then what the Crab
Nasties said...

66
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,550
about being police.

67
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,520
They were telling the truth!

68
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,770
<i>We don't know where they are.</i>

69
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,440
Okay, you two keep
looking from the air.

70
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,940
(Posey continues to sob)

71
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,540
But Megan, the Flories
were so pretty

72
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,280
and the Crab Nasties
so horrible looking.

73
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,080
I guess it's like...
when you see a seed,

74
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,290
it's hard to believe
there's a flower inside it.

75
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,960
Well, creatures can
be like that too.

76
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,240
They aren't always
what they seem.

77
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,260
Now take this little

97
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,490
I just can't believe

98
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,710
flowers could be
capable of such things.

99
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,470
We found 'em, Megan.
The lake, the lake.

100
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,340
We tried to warn you.

101
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,590
We tried to protect you,

102
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,850
but you wouldn't listen.

103
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,090
Now, they're your problem.

104
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,670
We just wanna wash our claws
of this whole rotten business.

105
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,730
Please?

106
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,070
I said we're sorry.

107
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,480
We know we were wrong.

108
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,930
But instead of arguing now,

109
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,770
let's work to beat those
creepy plant things, together!

110
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,150
(boulder crashes)

111
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,030
Captain, up there.

112
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:04,440
The Flories.

113
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,610
(boulder crashes)

114
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,960
(All laugh)

115
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,410
We can't leave the Ponies now.

116
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,630
No one should have to
face the Flories alone.

117
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,050
Crab Nasties...

118
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,840
Let's go get 'em.

119
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,510
Come on!

120
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,520
Let's fix these crabies
once and for all.

121
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,030
(Flories growl)

122
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,700
(All roar)

123
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,160
Oh, my!

124
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,750
Wizard, no!

125
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,890
(growls)

126
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,900
(grunts and groans)

127
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,190
- Posey!
- Megan!

128
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,810
(growls)

129
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,000
Coming, Posey.

130
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,320
<i>No! Go back, Jubilee.</i>

131
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,280
(roars)

132
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,450
Charge!

133
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,200
(evil laugh)

134
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,340
That's enough.

135
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,520
(loud tremoring)

136
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,710
(fearful cry)

137
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,970
Don't move.

138
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,220
Release the Ponies.

139
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,450
Release the girl.

140
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,280
Or it's snip-snip for you.

141
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,410
Flories!

142
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,000
Surrender...

143
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,740
(Flories growling)

144
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,420
Time to shove off.

145
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,380
Gotta file our
report on this case.

146
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,470
And your names will be
mentioned, prominently.

147
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,220
I'm so sorry.

148
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,720
She certainly paid a
big enough price.

149
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,970
Her garden's a mess.

150
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,010
Oh, that's okay, Megan.

151
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,270
It can be fixed.

152
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,850
There you go, Ma'am.

153
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,610
Ready for replanting.

154
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,380
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you!

155
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,630
Ya know... Ya know what?

156
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,370
I think...I-I think
you're all beautiful.

157
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,690
Anything you say, Ma'am.

158
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,430
And uh... ah...

159
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,310
Gee wiz...thanks.
