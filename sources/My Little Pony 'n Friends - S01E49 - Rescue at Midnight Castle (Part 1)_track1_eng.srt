00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,430
will I ever fly like
Firefly and Medley?

27
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,720
No, Ember.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,590
Not all little ponies can fly.

29
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,890
Will I jump far like Bow Tie?

30
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,390
Or disappear like you can?

31
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:45,180
Ember, you'll grow up to
be your own special little pony.

32
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,260
Everybody, quick! Come on.

33
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,780
Oh no! No way...

34
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,930
Oh no...

35
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,600
(squeaking)

36
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,830
Ahh..
What's going on?

37
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,290
- It's the Stratadons!
- Stratadons?

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,780
Run!

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,080
Help! Help!

40
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,010
Seize them!

41
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,880
Whoaaaaaah, help!

42
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,860
You are all doomed.

43
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,390
Soon every pony
will belong to Tirrac,

44
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,860
the master of Midnight Castle.

45
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,810
Help! Aah!

46
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,290
Firefly,

47
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,790
no! Wait!

48
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,630
Where are you going?

49
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,820
To get help!

50
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,000
No, come back!

51
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,460
It's too dangerous!

52
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,630
Firefly, come back!

53
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,800
Come back!

54
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,900
Listen, Scorpan,

55
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,850
can I go with you next time?
Huh?

56
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,730
- Can I? Can I?
- No, Spike.

57
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,000
I can slither really fast,
Scorpan, really fast.

58
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,070
- Not now, Spike, not now.
- Aww...

59
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,420
(Tirrac )
Quiet, my friend.
Your time will come.

60
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,200
We have captured two
of the little ponies, Master.

61
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,080
Have you forgotten something,
Scorpan?

62
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,120
Yes, that is better.

63
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,270
Two ponies, you say?
Only two?

64
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,460
Yes, Master.

65
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,630
But I need four ponies
for my chariot.

66
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,270
Not two, not three, four.

67
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,130
Yeah, Yeah,
but he tried to get them,

68
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,610
Master Honest
I mean honestly,

69
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,780
he really
and truly tried and...

70
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,020
Silence!

71
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,200
You will prepare another raid,
Scorpan...NOW!

72
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,960
As you wish...Master.

73
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,290
That is precisely what I wish.

74
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,410
Look, TJ a shooting star!

75
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,800
Whoah! Whoooooah!

76
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,460
Whooooooaaaaaaaaaah!

77
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,310
Whatever it is,

78
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,170
it sure is heavy!

79
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,230
- Hello.
- Talking pony?!

80
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,230
Ugh. I can fly too.

81
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,070
At least I could before
my wings got soaked!

82
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,820
(whinnies)

83
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,700
Sorry.

84
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,610
What...who are you?

85
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,160
My name's Firefly.

86
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,710
What's yours?

87
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,830
Megan, and...and that's
my pony, TJ.

88
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,420
Hey! Firefly,
where are you going?

89
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,760
Slow down.

90
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,590
Yep, Yep, Yep,
looks high enough...

91
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,050
High enough...
high enough for what?

92
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,190
Hop on.

93
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,270
Uh...you do know how to ride,
I hope?

94
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,690
- Of Course I know how to ride.
- Great!

95
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,520
Hey! Where are we going?

96
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,440
To help my friends,
they need you.

97
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,690
Me? What can I do?

98
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,810
- You're strong.
- No, I'm not.

99
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,110
- You can fight.
- No, I can't.

100
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,040
And you can fly.

101
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,530
I said I could ride...not fly!

102
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,660
Oh, my friends are just
gonna love you!

103

(scream)

167
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,720
(growls)

168
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,650
What's happened to my friends?

169
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,620
They belong to me now.

170
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,780
And, Scorpan, if by midnight

171
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,380
I do not have a fourth pony,

172
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,120
a head will roll...HIS!

173
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,550
(evil laugh)

174
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,420
The Moochick has magic powers.
He'll help us.

175
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,420
He lives in the Mushromp,
over there.

176
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:02,650
This bridge doesn't feel
very safe.

177
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,770
Come on, it's fine!

178
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,430
Whooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

179
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,150
APPLEJACK!

180
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,770
I'll save her.
