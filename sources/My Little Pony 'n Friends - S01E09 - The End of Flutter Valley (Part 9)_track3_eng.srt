00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,920
Whoah!

12
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,510
Don't let the Stonebacks
get me, Megan.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,910
They won't hurt you, Furbob.

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,150
Would you rather be up there?

15
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,500
Come on.
Let's fill up the hole.

16
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,410
I can't see a thing.

17
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,460
We know they're down there.

18
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,700
And so is the Sunstone.

19
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,460
Lead the way, Pointer.

20
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,760
Er...
Listen, your Bumbleness.

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,880
I'm not really good
at dark places...

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,130
Could somebody else go?

23
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,430
What?
Are you saying no to me?

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,560
Well, no. No, no, no, no, no!

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,480
It's just that you're the queen.

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,370
I wouldn't want anyone to think
that...that...that

27
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,440
you're not the bravest just
because you didn't go first.

28
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,960
Oh yes.
Bravest.

29
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,450
Very well, Pointer.

30
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,150
I shall deed
by my deeds,

31
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,380
not by my words.

32
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,700
Stand back!

33
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,500
Get me out of here!

34
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,590
If we hurry,

35
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,140
we can still get the Sunstone
back to Flutter Valley

36
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,400
before sunset.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,860
You can't stay
there forever, Furbob!

38
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,900
Yes I can.

39
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,850
At least until
the Stonebacks leave!

40
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,740
But they don't want to leave.

41
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,070
They helped save us.

42
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,490
I still think it's a trick.
Stonebacks hate Furbobs!

43
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,420
(Blows raspberry)
(snorts)

44
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,080
Why did you do that?

45
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,370
We always do that.

46
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,780
Then they chase us,
and we run away,

47
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,600
and we have to
find a new home.

48
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,920
Did you ever think that
maybe

49
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,510
the Stonebacks
want to be your friends?

50
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,840
Are you serious?

51
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,640
All they do is snort,
dig up the ground and chase us.

52
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,600
It's not easy to get your point
across when you can't talk.

53
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,270
Try imagining what it would be
like if the Stonebacks

54
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,520
were your friends.

55
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,270
My imagination is not
that good.

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,370

What do you think,
Furbob?

79
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,840
Well, it does sound
like a good idea.

80
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,010
(snorts)

81
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,010
But I do have to check
with the other Furbobs first.

82
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,860
Come on, Megan.

83
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,800
We have to get the Sunstone
back to Flutter Valley.

84
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,150
How are you going to
get it there, Rosedust?

85
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,770
It's too hot to handle.

86
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,700
All we have to do
is cool it off.

87
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,480
We can use utter flutter.

88
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,730
Right, let's do it.

89
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,910
That's fantastic.
I wonder if I can do that?

90
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,000
It's cold now.
We can move it.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,170
I've got the Sunstone.

92
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,410
Which way to Flutter Valley?

93
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,140
(snorts)

94
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,970
They want us to follow them.

95
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,750
To Flutter Valley.
Hurry!

96
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,170
Buzz, buzz, buzz!

97
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,990
Er...
Don't be so upset,

98
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,310
your Bumbleness.

99
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,810
Upset?

100
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,580
WHO'S UPSET?
Buzz!

101
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,020
It's just a silly Sunstone.

102
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,070
We never had one before.

103
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,780
I know that.

104
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,080
But once you taste
the good life

105
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,290
it's very hard to give it up.

106
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,110
So I have an idea,
Pointer.

107
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,540
Er...
What is that,

108
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,430
your Bumbleness?

109
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,790
<i>LET'S GO TO FLUTTER VALLEY
AND GET IT BACK!</i>

110
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,060
(Stonebacks snorts)

111
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,220
It's almost sunset.

112
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,320
We'll never make it in time.

113
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,650
Oh, Flutter Valley
is going to wilt away.

114
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,030
Don't give up,
Flutter Ponies.

115
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,910
There's still time to get
the Sunstone in place.

116
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,000
Don't forget the witches.

117
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,040
What about them?

118
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,460
Oh,
I forgot to tell you,

119
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,040
the witches have
taken over Flutter Valley.

120
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,640
Oh no!

121
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,630
I'll go to Furbobia,
and get the rest of the Furbobs.

122
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,830
Maybe they can help.

123
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,350
Hop on, Furbob!
I'll get you there in no time.

124
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,220
Meet you all at Flutter Valley.

125
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,850
Not that way,
this way.

126
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,440
(buzz)

127
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,930
It's a race against the sun,
Flutter Ponies. Hurry!

128
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,820
(snorts)

129
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,240
(gasps)

130
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,440
Can I stop now, Hydia?
Please!

131
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,750
No, one more lap.

132
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,590
Because of you the little ponies
almost escaped.

133
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,260
Yeah, sister dear.
(crunches)

134
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,120
They almost got away.
(crunches)

135
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,880
She heard me.

136
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,140
She didn't mean to disobey you,
Hydia.

137
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,430
It was really our fault.

138
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,680
Yeah. Gee, we were only trying
to teach her some magic tricks.

139
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,680
I'll teach the tricks
in my family, okay?

140
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,800
Everybody is a magician.

141
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,690
The Flutter Ponies
are coming back.

142
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,040
What?

143
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,360
(gasps)

144
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,960
I said, the Flutter Ponies
are coming back.

145
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,450
Listen.

146
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,670
It is the Flutter Ponies.

147
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,320
(cheers)

148
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,750
There's still time
to save Flutter Valley.

149
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,260
Shut up! There's no time
to save anything.

150
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,500
It's almost sunset.

151
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,420
We've got to stop them,
Hydia.

152
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,720
What if they have the Sunstone?

153
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,010
Ahhg!

154
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,480
Roooooaaaaggghhrr!

155
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,180
Guard the entrance.
Don't let anyone in. Nobody.

156
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,520
Rooaaaagghhrr!

157
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,070
Oh no. Not Ahhg.
They'll never get past him.

158
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,790
But Hydia, don't you remember
what happened the last time?

159
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,200
Of course I remember.

160
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,330
And Ahhg won't be tickled again.

161
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,210
Come here, Ahhgy.

162
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,700
I've got something for you.

163
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,620
Roooaaaaggghhrr!

164
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,350
Drink this,
my little Ahhgy.

165
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,130
And we won't have anything
to fear from Megan

166
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,560
and the Flutter Ponies.

167
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,820
We're going to make it.

168
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,730
It's Ahhg!
He's blocking the way.

169
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,480
Rooooaaagghr!

170
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,870
Not you again?

171
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,700
Rooooaaaaghr!

172
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,080
We can fly over him, Megan,

173
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,570
but we can't carry the Sunstone.

174
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,740
It's too heavy.

175
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,580
We'll never make it
in time now.

176
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,250
Not to worry. I know just
how to handle Ahhg.

177
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,300
We found out he's ticklish.

178
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,570
All you have to do is tickle him

179
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,310
and he'll fold up
like an accordion.

180
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,740
Coochy coochy coo!

181
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,270
Maybe if we all do it...

182
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,570
Coochy coochy coo!

183
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,740
Coochy coochy coo!

184
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,270
I don't understand.
It worked last time.

185
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,870
Rooooaaaaghr!

186
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,000
We'll never get past him.

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,160
And it's almost sunset.

188
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,340
What are we going to do?

189
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:37,880
Roooaaaaghhr!
