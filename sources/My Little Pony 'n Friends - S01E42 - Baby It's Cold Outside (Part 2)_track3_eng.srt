Four-feet invade
kingdom of Charlatan.

<i>Is forbidden!</i>

Galaxy, North Star, over here.

00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,340
No, Megan. Stop!

00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,330

(groans with exhaustion)

28
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,450
Come on.
Maybe now we can get it--

29
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,000
Halt! We take you prisoner

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,200
in the name of his majesty,
King Charlatan The Great.

31
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:09,930
Move!

32
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,640
Sonny, Sonny, are you in here?

33
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,190
Oh, Sonny, where can I take you
so you can thaw out?

34
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,390
All right, through here,
right in this cell.

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,870
That's it. That's it.
Trod in there.

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,730
I say, you must
let us out of here right now!

37
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,410
Oh, it's no use.

38
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,320
I fear we shan't be able to
tunnel through the floor.

39
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,460
We can't squeeze through
the bars either, Megan.

40
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,570
We've tried everything

41
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,970
and I can't wink
through the wall, so--

42
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,080
I know, Galaxy, I know.

43
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,390
Wait a minute!
My horn!

44
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,100
When I make it light up,
it gets warmer.

45
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,090
Maybe I can make it hot enough
to melt those bars of ice.

46
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,930
(zapping sound)

47
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,560
I think you've got
something there.

48
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,600
Good work, Galaxy.
Keep it up!

49
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,560
You're almost through.

50
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,360
Yikes, it's moving.

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,120
Sshhh,
don't make so much noise

52
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,070
or the guard will come
and catch us.

53
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,910
What are you doing here?

54
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,780
I'm trying to help
my friend thaw out.

55
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,450
This is your friend?
This sculpture?

56
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,700
That's my friend, Sonny.

57
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,290
He's frozen solid
inside the ice.

58
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,790
I thought maybe her horn
could help him thaw out.

59
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,430
Maybe. We're trying
to thaw things out too.

60
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,680
Everything.

61
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,430
<i>(footsteps)
Quick! The guard is coming.</i>

62
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,930
Pretend to be my prisoners
and do what I tell you.

63
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,390
Prince Edgar!
I didn't expect to see you here.

64
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,470
Umm--His Royal Majesty,
my father,

65
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,070
wishes to have these creatures
transferred to my custody.

66
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,230
You two, bring along the duck.

67
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,820
If we wanna thaw things out,

68
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,250
we've gotta get
to father's magnifier

69
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,630
and get him to
reverse its power.

70
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,710
Father's built a lot of
booby traps into this castle.

71
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,180
So watch your step.

72
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,500
Huh?

73
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,340
Oof!

74
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,500
I said, "be careful."

75
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,260
(siren sounds)

76
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,570
(gasps)

77
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,690
(Surprise)
Help!

78
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,760
(Edgar)
Follow me!

79
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,180
This way.

80
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,540
(All pant)

81
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,040
Don't relax yet.

82
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,920
We've got a long way to go.

83
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,800
(loud tumbling)

84
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,300
It's gaining on us.

85
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,020
It's dry ice!

86
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,850
Jump!

87
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,930
Put your friend on my back.

88
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,230
(All gasp)

89
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,460
We made it.

90
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,980
(All cheer)
Yay! Oh, yeah!

91
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,160
Don't congratulate
yourselves yet.

92
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,670
We haven't passed
the worst of it.

93
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,820
My father's throne room
is right in here.

94
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,090
(bangs the door)

95
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,710
Locked?

96
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,210
Then let's break it down!

97
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,140
Edgar, my son,
you disappoint me.

98
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,420
No more than you have
disappointed me, father.

99
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,490
It's my duty.
Stand aside, Edgar.

100
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,140
<i>No, father!</i>

101
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,600
No!

102
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,770
Oh, my!

103
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,440
(Both gasp)

104
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,780
(clears throat)

105
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,280
Well, what are you waiting for?

106
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,530
Arrest them.

107
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,290
<i>Well?</i>

108
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,790
But sire, what of the prince?

109
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,290
I--I don't know.

110
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,840
He shouldn't have
tried to interfere.

111
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,790

Hmm, it's not reversible.

I...blame myself and my folly...

134
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,880
It was my cold heart which--

135
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,190
(Edgar)
<i>Don't be sad.</i>

136
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,650
No.
I must face facts.

137
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,190
But father--

138
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,220
Edgar, how many times have I--

139
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,230
Edgar?

140
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,870
Yes, father, and you did it.

141
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,650
Only you could break
your own cold spell.

142
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,530
But how?

143
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,980
Because you love him,
and you proved it

144
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,000
with the tear that melted
the coldness of your icy stare.

145
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,660
It can't hurt to try anyway.

146
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,600

147
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,310

Shoop Bee Doo!

152
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,420
You did it, Galaxy

153
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,170
Ah! That's nice.
Achoo.

154
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,930
Well, goodbye,
Good King Charlatan.

155
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,390
It makes me so proud

156
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,680
to hear you call my father,
Good King Charlatan.

157
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,800
And I plan to live up to it
too...with Edgar's help.

158
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,350
I'm sure you will.
Goodbye!

159
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,980
(Surprise)
Take care!
