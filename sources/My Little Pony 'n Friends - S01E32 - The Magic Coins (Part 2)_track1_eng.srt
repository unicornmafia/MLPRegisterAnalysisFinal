Look! The baby Seaponies!

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,290
They've run out of water!

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,580
They will not long survive
out of their natural habitat.

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,800
I know Wind Whistler.

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,170
But where do we find water to
put them in?

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,040
There is a pond due south
about a mile.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,180
Okay.
Ribbon, Whistler, Lofty,

17
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,040
Lickety-Split, Danny and Molly,

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,190
you get the baby Seaponies
to water.

19
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,720
The rest of you,
come with me to the Mushromp.

20
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,050
You think they'll be okay?

21
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,720
It's up to us to make sure.

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,440
Right.
Aa...how do we do that?

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,690
By getting to the Moochick

24
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,720
and finding a way
to make it rain.

25
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,070
Come on!

26
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,890
(Spike)
Oh boy! I sure hope

27
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,710
the Moochick is figuring out
a way to keep things cool.

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,650
(fan creaking)

29
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,730
Welcome! Welcome!

30
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,750
My, my, I thought it was too hot
for anyone to come visiting.

31
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,370
It's because of the heat
that we're here Mr. Moochick.

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,080
I guess!

33
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,960
I don't suppose
everyone can enjoy the comforts

34
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,980
of modern technology
like Habbit and I.

35
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,250
A magic coin like these
started the heat wave.

36
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,850
Aah...oh..yes, yes, yes, yes.

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,720
These look familiar now.

38
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,180
Where have I seen them before?

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,140
Ooh, let's see.

40
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,190
Yeah, ooh, oh, well,
it's around somewhere.

41
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,680
Now where did I put that thing?

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,930
Oh, it...where is the...

43
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,830
Oh, I know it's around here
somewhere,

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,150
I just saw it now.

45
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,450
Oh..mmm...oh
where it could be?

46
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,740
I have woken up...
I have just had it yesterday.

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,110
Now! There it is!

48
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,500
I knew I'll find it, ow!

49
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,420
There's a lot to be said
for a well-organized library.

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,840
Now, according to this,
the coins come from

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,620
the treasure collection of
Niblick the Troll,

52
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,060
who lives far away
in the dangerous Crimson Canyon

53
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,180
that's beyond the jewel desert.
Of course, mm-hm.

54
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,780
That's all very interesting,
Mr. Moochick.

55
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,100
But can you do anything

56
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,800
to reverse the effects
of the wish?

57
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,030
Ooh! No, no, no, no,
absolutely not.

58
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,280
I'm afraid, you see,

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,540
since the treasure
belongs to Niblick,

60
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,060
only he can reverse its magic.

61
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,710
Hmm...okay.

62
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,650
Then we'll just go talk
to this Niblick

63
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,700
and ask him to help us.

64
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,040
Ooh...I don't know.

65
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,040
Trolls are usually crotchety
and ill-mannered.

66
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,040
And Niblick's even crankier
than most.

67
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,090
We don't have any choice.

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,250
Come on again!
We're off the Crimson Canyon.

69
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,720
Thanks for your help,
Mr. Moochick.

70
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,670
No, you're quite
welcome, I am sure.

71
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,920
Habbit!

72
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,220
Had you seen the book
I was reading?

73
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,010
I don't know
where it got through.

74
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,510
Oh no!
Its dried up!

75
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,010
Whistler, you couldn't know

76
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,980
the water would dry up
this quickly.

77
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,510
Is there somewhere else
we can go?

78
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,990
We just have to find water
for the Seaponies.

79
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,110
It's even too hot to fly.

80
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,860
This weather is simply death
to my complexion.

81
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,160
We'll have to ration
what's left of the water.

82
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,410
Everybody gets one cupful.

83
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,430
Ow...oh.

84
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,340
That's okay Spike.
You can have some of mine.

85
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,260
Thank you, Galaxy.

86
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,790
If we do not find water soon
Wind Whistler,

87
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,720
we'll be as bad off
as the poor baby Seaponies.

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,110
We've come too far
to retreat now, Megan.

89
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,600
The only course is
straight ahead.

90
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,370
Uhh..how much further
is it Megan?

91
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,390
Ya...I'm thirsty.

92
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,370
Come on guys!
Cheer up!

93
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,200
Everything's gonna be all right.

94
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,370
Sure it is, I guess.

95
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,530
You know, a song might make us
feel better.

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,390
Ugh, singing made us
even more exhausted...ugh.

114
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,200
Water...must have water.

115
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,250
Galaxy, the cactus!

116
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,740
Use your horn on the cactus.

117
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,670
There might be water.

118
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,670
Hey, you're right!
Water!

119
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,220
(All gasp)

120
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,560
Water!

121
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,640
Mm...it's too bad we can't

122
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,730
take any to the baby Seaponies.

123
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,600
There used to be water here.

124
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,150
Well, there isn't now.

125
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,020
We just have to keep looking.

126
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,430
And hope it isn't too late.

127
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,280
Megan,
I don't wanna scare anyone.

128
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,990
But I have the distinct feeling
we're being followed.

129
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,610
Let's get out of here, huh,
can we? huh, please!

130
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,280
(all gasp)

131
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,830
Hiya...hiya...hiya,
Hoo..hoo...hoo

132
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,010
My name's Puck.
Who are you?

133
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,300
Uh...well, my name is Megan.

134
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,510
And my friends are--

135
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,790
So what are you doin' here?

136
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,020
Well, we're--

137
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,800
(chuckles)
Let me guess.

138
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,550
You're trying to find
Niblick the Troll...right?

139
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,930
You must be!

140
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,200
He's the only one
who'd live around here.
(chuckles)

141
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,940
Come on!
I'll take you to his house.

142
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,190
Well, uh...it--

143
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,190
It looks like we've got a guide.

144
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,120
If we can keep up with him.

145
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,080
This way, this way,
not far now.

146
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,200
I think
we're still being followed.

147
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,330
(grumbling)
And now I'm sure of it.

148
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,330
Puck, get us out of here!

149
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,550
Right!
Just follow me!

150
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,840
Trust me.
Hoo..hoo...hoo.

151
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,400
I know these gullies
like the back of my hand.

152
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,670
Oops!

153
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,670
(hungry growl)

154
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,980
We're trapped!

155
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,190
Goodbye cruel world.

156
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,340
As much as I hate to say it,

157
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,940
we'll have to use
one of the coins.

158
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,020
Goblins are afraid of light.

159
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,570
I wish there was light!

160
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,450
(all scream)

161
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,740
Hey! It worked.

162
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,490
And the magic didn't backfire
on us this time.

163
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,710
Time to go, time to go.
Hoo..hoo...hoo.

164
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,590
Niblick's house
is not far from here.

165
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,970
Sorry about
getting lost last night.

166
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,260
But I know my way now.

167
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,470
Look!
<i>There it is!</i>

168
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,520
Nah! I say hello!

169
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,890
Hello there!

170
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,310
Aah, would you be so kind
as to lower the bridge?

171
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,480
Sure!

172
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,700
But you gotta give me
your crown.

173
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,810
(both gasp)

174
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,790
Out of the question.

175
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,880
<i>Now lower it I say.</i>

176
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,240
<i>I'm off to slay a dragon
and rescue a damsel.</i>

177
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,380
Not unless you pay the toll.

178
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,630
(angrily mutters)
Th-th-this is <i>outrageous.</i>

179
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,550
Wrong!
This is your living.

180
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,590
You don't like it,
grow a pair of wings.

181
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,090
No!...Er...Very well.
I agree.

182
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,310
That's more like it.

183
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,990
(horse whines)

184
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,570
Oh!
The Moochick wasn't kidding.

185
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,570
That troll's bad news.

186
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,910
(gears ratchet)

187
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,030
(bridge slams)

188
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:00,280
Aah, I shall report you
to my father, the king.

189
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,580
Aah! Put an egg in your sandal
and beat it.

190
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,210
(giggles)

191
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,500
<i>Yo-hoo!</i>

192
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,850
Um, Mr. Niblick!

193
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,510
Would you like to know

194
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,090
what happened to your
chest of magic coins?

195
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,890
Bring 'em on over,

196
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,680
and I'll give you discount
on the toll.

197
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,530
<i>Hold it! hold it!</i>

198
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,770
I don't see no coins.

199
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,440
What's the deal?

200
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,720
Well, uh...uh...that is we--

201
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,320
Well, we spent them.

202
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,310
It was an accident,
I'm sure you understand.

203
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,240
You spent my magic coins?

204
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,040
<i>You spent my magic coins?</i>

205
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,000
My coins! My coins!
Ohh-ho-ho!

206
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,080
(gears ratchet)
(All scream)
