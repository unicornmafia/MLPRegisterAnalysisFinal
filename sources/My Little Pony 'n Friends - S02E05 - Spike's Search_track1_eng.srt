Good return, Spike!

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,660
(laughs)

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,630
Get it, baby Tiddley.

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,950
Good one.

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,840
I got it, I got it.

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,220
(grunts)

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,350
Oh...Baby Tiddley-Winks.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,190
(grunts)

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,970
Way to go, Baby Tiddley.

19
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,270
It's yours, Spike.

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,530
(sneezes fire)

21
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,470
There, there!

22
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,440
Yeah, yeah,
it's all right, all right.

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,220
You all right, Baby Lofty?

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,570
Oh, it's okay.

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,610
No, this won't happen again,
will it Megan?

26
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,530
Not a big flame like this.

27
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,360
Well, Spike you're getting
to be big dragon now.

28
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,040
And I wouldn't be surprised

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,800
if your fire breathing powers
get stronger as you grow.

30
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,540
You'll just have to learn
how to control them.

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,410
Growing up isn't so great.

32
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,300
(sneezes fire)

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,750
Hey, everything's okay.

34
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,380
Nobody got hurt.

35
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,500
I can't make it go out.

36
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,050
Spike, it's no big deal.

37
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,650
You're a dragon,

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,510
dragons breathe fire.

39
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,340
Swell.

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,480
Who's gonna show me
how to use my fire breath?

41
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,760
That's what I wanna know.

42
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,320
I can read up on dragons.

43
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,990
You know, their history
and everything.

44
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,740
Oh, books are one thing,

45
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,450
But what I need is experience.

46
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,610
I need to go find some dragons.

47
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,660
You mean, go on a quest.

48
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,330
But that could be dangerous.

49
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,360
Maybe so,

50
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,660
but the only way I can learn
how to be a dragon

51
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,620
is from real dragons.

52
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,090
Okay. But you're
not goin' alone.

53
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,380
Oh, maybe this wasn't
such a great idea.

54
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,690
We haven't seen anybody so far.
Much less any dragons.

55
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,300
(bird screaming)

56
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,600
Oof!

57
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,610
(laughs)

58
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,980
Who are you guys?

59
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,200
I'm Spike and this is Danny.

60
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,810
Are you all right?

61
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,480
Yes I'm all right.

62
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,450
I just don't know how to fly.

63
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,870
I was separated
from my parents a while ago.

64
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,870
And I've been looking
for them ever since.

65
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,040
If only
I could find...my parents.

66
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,120
(sighs sadly)

67
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,580
(sneezes fire)

68
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,500
I know what ya mean.

What's your name?

86
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,320
Weston!

87
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,860
Well, come with us, Weston.

88
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,780
After I find some dragons,

89
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,700
you can come back
to Paradise Estate with us.

90
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,820
Yeah!

91
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,950
Sure.

92
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,400
I guess it's better
than just waiting here.

93
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,990
Maybe we should
look down there.

94
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:27,320
(cackles)

95
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,650
This isn't quite
what I expected.

96
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,930
They look awful scary.

97
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,160
I've got to go talk to them.

98
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,020
Good luck looking
for your parents.

99
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,990
You want us to stick around?

100
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,110
Nope.

101
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,820
These are my dragons.

102
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,540
I have to face them on my own.

103
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,690
Good luck, Spike.

104
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,010
And what have we here?

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,830
(stammers)
If you please, sir,

106
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,300
I thought maybe if it wouldn't
be too much trouble,

107
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,670
you might allow me to
join your band?

108
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,690
Whatta we want him around for?

109
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,930
Little pipsqueak like him
would only get in our way.

110
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,190
Wait!

111
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,110
You wanting to join a
dragon camp is all very well.

112
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,900
But we dragons
have certain criteria,

113
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,980
which must be met.

114
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:22,480
We generously offer to protect

115
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,120
the citizens of a nearby village
for a token consideration.

116
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,240
The selection of their
best food stuffs and delicacies.

117
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,960
But the townspeople
have been slow to respond

118
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,580
to our magnanimous offer.

119
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,800
So a little visit is in order.

120
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,630
You may accompany us
so that we can judge

121
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,850
how good a dragon
you really are.

122
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,590
(marketplace chatter)

123
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,930
(roar)

124
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,240
(yelling)

125
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,620
(growling)

126
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,460
Help! Help!

127
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,700
You?

128
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,950
Me?

129
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,850
Yes, you. Pick that up!

130
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,760
(evil laugh)

131
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,540
This isn't right.

132
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:34,280
(evil laugh)

133
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,890
- This is awful.
- We've gotta stop 'em.

134
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,560
Come on,
let's go to Paradise Estate.

135
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,900
And then they marched
back to their camp

136
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,030
with all the food they'd stolen.

137
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,570
I think I'll just see
what they're up to.

138
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,790
Well! My boy.

139
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,990
(burp)

140
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,380
What do you think of
the dragon life now?

141
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,240
Terrific, isn't it?

142
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,090
Of course, this doesn't
mean you're in yet.

143
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,800
Ya know, ya might have more fun,

144
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,670
if you were more like
my friends, the little ponies.

145
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,230
Little ponies?

146
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,680
Yeah, yeah.

147
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,270
The little ponies live
in Dream Valley

148
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,810
and play games all day
and make cookies and cupcakes.

149
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,610
Cookies and cupcakes?

150
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,650
And swim in the waterfall
and pick flowers.

151
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:32,170
Why... We'd love to visit
the little ponies.

152
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,700
Take us to Dream Valley,
and you'll be one of the gang.

153
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,780
Especially, if they
give us cupcakes.

154
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,170
They're coming here.

155
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,710
I think we should prepare a
proper welcome for 'em.

156
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,840
I have an idea.

157
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:54,100
(laughs)

158
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,970
(grunting in sequence)

159
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,800
What's this?

160
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,850
How did they know
we were coming?

161
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,400
Welcome, we've been
waiting for you.

162
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,730
Yes indeed.

163
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,280
We have a big meal
all ready for you.

164
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,070
With cupcakes?

165
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,160
I can't believe how easy
this is gonna be.

166
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,750
Move outta the way, Spike.

167
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,320
Smart move ponies.

168
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,590
Give us food and keep it coming.

169
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,910
Yeah.

170
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,750
Especially the cupcakes,

171
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,670
'cause if you don't
there's gonna be trouble.

172
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,800
Hey, wait a minute
these are my friends.

173
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,900
Not anymore.
You're one of us now.

174
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,310
Ah... cupcakes.

175
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,060
(laughing)

176
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,570
But you don't
have to be mean.

177
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,910
They'll share
everything they have.

178
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,440
We just wanna make certain.

179
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,650
Hey Guys!

180
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,280
Surprise!

181
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,870
(All yell)

182
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,430
(All yell)

183
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,040
And you can expect
more where that came from

184
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,760
if you start any more trouble!

185
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,710
Yeah, I wanted to learn
how to be a dragon, not a bully.

186
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,460
Go!

187
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,210
Let's get outta here.

188
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,140
Don't forget.

189
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,280
Okay, okay we're goin'.

190
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,640
Just havin' a little fun.
No sense of humor.

191
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,520
Boy, some people.

192
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,650
What's the matter, Weston?

193
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,900
Aren't you enjoying yourself?

194
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,370
Oh, yeah!

195
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,580
Everything's wonderful here.
It's just that...

196
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,400
Weston, look!

197
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,490
Mama! Daddy!

198
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,720
I guess I'll never learn how
to be a grown up dragon now.

199
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,640
But if being a dragon
means being a bully.

200
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,510
Nah! Look how many different
kinds of ponies there are.

201
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,020
Earth Ponies, Pegasi,
Flutter Ponies,

202
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,560
so there are probably all
different kinds of dragons too.

203
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,180
When the time is right,
you'll find the ones like you.

204
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,430
You really think so?

205
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,900
Well, then maybe for now being
here is the right place to be.

206
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,500
Anyway, I did learn
one thing from the dragons...

207
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,660
Yeah, what was that?

208
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,780
(sneezes fire)

209
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,660
(both laugh)
