As Valentine watched
her friend gallop away
into the darkening sunset,
a single lonely tear
rolled down her face...
...The End
Why would Valentine's
friend gallop away at sunset?
..huh?
It is illogical to begin
a long journey
just as the sun is setting.
Who cares
what the sun was doing
when he had to leave
his one true love?
Yeah, how can you ask
a question like that
at a time like this?
Time like what?
I fail to understand
this display of sentiment.
It is just a story, after all.
Wind Whistler, it's too bad
you weren't around
when the Feelings Fairy
was passing out feelings.
I do have feelings..
Which I think
you two just proved.
Yeah, by hurting 'em.
Way to go, Buttons.
Moi?
Look out!
Crunch the Rockdog comin'!
Run for your lives!
Yeah, run for your lives!
Run! Yeah, run, run!
Ow! I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry!
It's okay!
I'm glad you're sorry.
Let's go left!
Right, left! Yeah, right left!
Right left!
That's it, take it to the left!
Right!
I have feelings..
I merely refrain from expressing
them at the drop of a hat.
Don't feel bad, Wind Whistler.
They didn't mean it.
HELP! HELP!
The Rockdog from
the Purple Mountain,
oh, it was horrible.
Terrible, I tell you.
Turned to stone.
Made marshlands
into rocky valley!
Oh.. No more green,
and.. and- and- and- and- and-
Crunch the Rockdog
turned Bushwoolies-
turned Bushwoolies- to STONE!
I'm gonna give that obnoxious
Rockwhatis a piece of my mind.
I can't go nowhere 'til I change
into my travellin' outfit.
Everyone!
Please remain calm!
Calm? Calm?
Only someone with no feelings
could remain calm
at a time like this.
I meant that we need
a plan of action.
She's right!
But we better find out
what makes this Rockdog tick.
And for that, we'll have to talk
to the Moochick.
Don't you worry, lil' fella.
We won't let that
walking stalagmite hurt you.
Hello?
Mr. Moochick?
Ooh- get it, ooh- ooh,
no, no no no, ooh, no- no,
that way!
What's going on here,
Mr. Moochick?
After it!
I'll get it! There it is!
That is a.. a very smart stick.
Huh! too smart, if you ask me.
Doesn't know its place!
Aha!
Oh, he's scared!
Yes, he certainly is.
Aww, the poor little thing.
Perhaps it feels unappreciated,
or overworked?
Unappreciated?
Overworked?!
Let it have some fun.
Yeah, give it a day off!
Let's do that.
Well, alright!
It can have a day off
every time the mushrooms bloom.
Hah! Hm.. oh yes, yes,
that is more like it.
Now, what are you folks
doing here, hmmm?
Have you heard of
a Crunch the Rockdog?
He comes from somewhere in the
Purple Mountains.
Oh, no no no,
never heard of him.
But! If he's
from the Purple Mountains,
then you should talk
to His Elevated Eminence,
the Mountain King.
Ooh! Just head for
the Purple Mountains,
you can't miss it.
Thank you, Mr. Moochick.
At least, I think
it's His Elevated Eminence..
or is it His Royal Rockface..?
Hmmm..
This is bad, alright...
Purple Mountain!
So that's where we'll
find His Elevated Eminence, huh?
What was that?
C-C-C-C-C-CRUNCH THE ROCKDOG!
Look out! Behind you!
No, lil' fella! Don't do it!
Behind you! Behind you!
Behind me? Behind me?!
Oh, look!
Two for the price of one.
One...
Two...
I can handle him.
Danny, don't!
It's just a dog.
Oh no!
Hey, you!
Yeah, you! You fossilized mutt!
You're a bad dog!
Bad! Bad dog, sit! sit!
Heel, heel!
You- you granite mongrel!
Down boy! Lie Down... Down!
He's completely blown our cover.
At this point, I fear our
only recourse
is to make a run for it.
I think you're right.
What's so funny?
C'mon, Danny!
Heel! Sit!
After them!
Go on without me!
Gusty! What in tarnation
are you doin'?
Go on! I've got an idea!
We're not leaving you!
I'll draw them off,
and catch up at the Mountains.
Gusty,
I must protest.
Here's dust in your eye!
See? I'll blind 'em
with a small dust storm,
and I'm outta here!
Uh- oh...
Uh, come to think of it..
a little dust wouldn't have
much effect on rocks,
would it..?
Going somewhere?
Good! 'Cause I'd like you to..
..stick around!
Forever!
Must tell the little ponies!
Yeah, yeah! Tell Ponies!
Let's go! To Paradise Estate!
Tell 'em! Tell 'em! Let s go!
Yeah yeah,let s tell 'em!
Tell 'em! Tell 'em! Let s go!
Yeah yeah, tell 'em!
Ooh ho ho ho ho hooo!
Watch it!
Oh! No!
Ugh! Oof!
Oof!
Oh boy! Soon we're
gonna have our own territory.
Yeah, more space than
we knows what to do with!
OK, let's move it!
We haven't got all day -
come on!
Hey, we're moving.
You needn't get rough.
Ow!
Geronimo!
Danny!
Sorry, Danny is feeling
a little rambunctious today.
Today?
Come on, come on! Tell ponies!
We've got to tell them!
Tell ponies, tell ponies.
Gotta go to Paradise Estate.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Stop!
Stop!
Oh no, not again!
Ugh!
Tell 'em, tell 'em.
Tell 'em, yeah, tell 'em.
What's with you guys?
Thank you! Yeah, thank you,
thank you, thank you!
Thanks, thanks a lot. Thanks.
Well, what is it?
Ponies kidnapped!
Yeah, ponies kidnapped!
Yeah, ponies kidnapped,
Yeah yeah kidnapped!
What do you mean,
the ponies have been kidnapped?
Raptorians come with nets
and take them away!
Which ponies?
Lickety Split, Heart Throb
and Gusty.
Oh no!
Well, which way
did they go?
The Black Mountains!
We must form a search party
and follow their trail
while it's still fresh.
Uhh, Magic Star, Paradise
and North Star,
you come with me
and the Bushwoolies.
The rest of you stay here
in case they manage to escape
and make their way back here.
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Be careful.
Hurry back!
There must be something I can do
that no other pony can do.
There must be something!
My question is why?
What do they hope to gain?
Where in the world
have you been?
Have you heard, have you heard
about their kidnapping?
We're so worried.
What kidnapping?
What kidnapping?
A dozen Raptorians abducted
Lickety Split, Heart Throb
and Gusty
and took them with them
to the Black Mountains,
the Black Mountains.
Megan formed a rescue party
and went after them.
If only I hadn't been
so overly sensitive.
I should have stayed to listen
to what the other ponies
had to say.
But Shady,
you had no idea
that something
would happen to them.
But maybe I could
have helped them escape,
or I could have run for help,
or... Oh, dear!
Shady, it's not your fault.
Now I'm not only useless,
but I'm a deserter besides.
Deserter?
Oh, no! Not that, Shady.
No, never!
Wait a second, I don't get it -
what s she talking about?
Shady!
Shady! Shady,
come back!
Shady!
Look!
Bushwoolie fur?
It must be their
shedding season.
Maybe we better
follow the trail.
And we can be extra help
for everyone
in case they need it.
That's a brave idea.
Let's go.
Really?
You think so?
Ooh..welcome, welcome.
Ooh! Welcome, welcome!
Ooh! It's so beautiful.
It's perfect.
Just what I needed
to repair my cloak.
But first, the hair
must be absolutely squeaky clean
through the wash with them.
Look! over there.
It's Gusty's headband.
Our first clue.
Way to go, way to go,
way to go North Star?
The ponies must be around
here somewhere.
Spread out!
Clues, clues..
We want clues.
Hey! Megan.
Come here, quick!
This must be where
the Raptorians took the ponies.
So, what are we waiting for?
Come on! Help me push it.
Uh...It's no use.
We'll have to find
another way in.
But how?
Hey! our grand-daddies
used to live in these caverns.
We can find a way in there.
Wonderful!
Alright! Yeah! Yeah!
Wonderful.
Now, let me see.
Ah-ha this way.
Yeah, yeah, yeah this way!
No...
Thatta' way.
Thatta' way, thatta' way,
yeah, yeah, yeah!
Which way?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thatta' way.
Uh... But then again...
Mmm...
Move it, move it, move it.
Kazim, Kazam, Kazoom...
Ooh dear, this cloak
is practically worthless now.
Do something quick!
Not so tight!
Be sure they get good and clean.
Yes, yes.
Your most lovely highness.
Atchoo!
Soon, we'll have a better place
to live than this cramped dump
and we won't be needing
no Porcina, no more.
If only I could do something
to save Heart Throb,
Lickety-Split, and Gusty
all by myself.
I owe them that much.
We'll figure out something.
I don't want
anybody else's help.
Well, I am coming
along with you, just in case.
Okay.
Snip! Snip! Snip!
Ooh..! Do you think
they'll hurt us?
No, Heart Throb.
Look, all they want is our hair.
After that, they'll let us go.
I don't know, Gusty.
I think they want
more than that.
That's right.
This won't be
the end of it my pretties,
not even when we have
harvested your lovely dresses.
Why, then your job
is just beginning
and then your precious Ponyland
will never be the same.
What do you mean?
Why, thanks to your hair
Porcina will turn
all of Ponyland into glass.
Uhh!
Woebegone!
Come back here.
You miserable little wretch.
Oh, phew!
Oh, dear!
I've got you now, Woebegone.
Oh, my!
You're all looking so
bright and colorful today.
And who are you?
Sshhh! I'm in big trouble.
An aligatorsaur is after me.
Can I hide here a while?
Just till he's gone.
You can hide in there.
By the way,
what's an aligatorsaur?
You're about to find out.
Ahhh!
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
Has a little squirt and tattered
wretch run through here?
Are you sure?
Of course I'm sure.
Besides,
what's a big guy like you
chasin' a little squirt
for anyway?
Yeah, you should be
ashamed of yourself.
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?
If he's here, you'll find out.
If not, count yourselves lucky.
He's big trouble.
Aww...
Are you all right?
I'm fine, thank you.
Except for a tiny pain
in my big toe.
Aww, you're hurt!
Aligatorsaurs are big.
But they're really light
on their feet.
I'll be fine...really.
Wait!
We can't let you go.
You will if ya know
what's good for you.
See that?
I did that.
I thought that
big aligatorwhatsit did it.
That's true.
But I brought him here.
Bad luck follows me everywhere.
Oh, we won't hear another word.
You're staying with us.
No ifs...
Ouch!
...ands or buts.
There now.
You just rest easy for a while.
Then you can be on your way.
You just don't understand.
Aw, come on, uncle Woebegone.
Stay and go nappy time with us,
pwetty pwease?
When you wake up you can
have gingerbread cookies,
and milk.
Those are gingerbread cookies?
I don't know what happened
to them.
But they still taste good.
It's starting again.
First your cookies crumble,
then boom!
Your whole house falls down.
Nonsense! Now get some rest.
I'm warning you.
Help! Help!
Is everyone okay?
All safe, Posey
but awfully scared.
We have to sleep outside?
Of course not.
We'll find a place for you
in the Estate.
Go with Masquerade.
Where's Woebegone?
He must still be in there.
He is so still...
Is he--
Achoo!
You're alive!
Not if we don't get out of here.
Good idea.
Surely now you realize
that you've got to let me go.
Oh, I don't know.
It looks to me like the roof was
gonna collapse... eventually.
Now stop being so hard
on yourself.
You just need
a good night's sleep.
Maybe you'd like to tell us
why that giant creature was
chasing you so ferociously?
I passed through his
village and demolished it.
Ohh, come on!
Surely your whole life
hasn't been just an accident
waiting to happen?
Well, if you really
wanna know,
it started
when I was just a lad.
My homeland was a
beautiful, tropical garden.
Everything was lush and green.
Me and a couple pals were
kickin' around a kaleidostone
then Hand-me-Down spotted her.
Look!
It's the old witch.
Come on. Follow me.
I got an idea.
Wait for me.
She-she's never
done us any harm.
You don't wanna have fun?
Then just watch.
We're gonna dump her
in her own brew.
Come on, Tattle!
Okay, okay. Wait a sec.
I'm comin'.
Won't leave me alone, eh?
Wanna play rough, do they?
Okay.
All right. You distract her
with the kaleidostone,
while Tattle and I
turn over her pot.
And don't blow it.
Ah, ha!
Please don't hurt my friends.
They really didn't mean
any harm.
There I was, floating
in the soup with her,
and was she ever mad.
Uh...
It's okay.
Only one wall fell down.
At least, we won't need
an air conditioner.
Come on.
We'll have to find you
another place to sleep tonight.
Good.
Then I can finish my story.
Uh, some other time.
We've had enough excitement
for one night,
thank you.
If I stay here any longer,
Paradise Estate will be anything
but a paradise.
Uh-oh!
Oh!
Thank goodness
they're heavy sleepers.
Well, at least that didn't fall.
For a second there I thought my
bad luck was working overtime.
Gusty. Lickety-Split.
What's the matter?
Woebegone's disappeared.
He's gone.
Oh, good!
If he stayed any longer,
Paradise Estate would've become
a disaster area.
You don't actually believe
that bad luck stuff?
What difference does it make?
All that matters is
that he's hurt.
And that he needs us
to take care of him.
Come on!
If they're gonna bring that
little jinx back,
I'd better reinforce
the whole Estate.
Ohh...
Thank you very much.
Uh-ho!
Look who's back.
And he probably brought his
bad luck with him.
There's no such thing
as bad luck.
And the nursery of Paradise
Estate didn't really collapse,
the moon's made of
green cheese,
and I'm the Queen of England.
Of course, the nursery of
Paradise Estate collapsed,
but no one was hurt.
Lickety-Split's right.
I am bad luck.
And if you don't believe it,
watch.
Ohhhh...
Never mind that.
That old tree,
uh, must have been
filled with termites.
But I am a jinx.
Run to the Estate fast.
It's dangerous to be
in the same place
as that Woebegone character.
Whoa!
Help me!
Help!
We got them, Draggle.
They'll never survive this.
What is this?
It's a land pie.
Wh-What?
What's a land pie?
It's was...it's a...
Well...oh,
you told me to make it.
I told you to make a landslide,
not a land-pie.
Ugh!
Ew...
You've ruined everything.
Let's get out of here.
The landslide has stopped.
The witches are leaving.
It's safe now.
Yeah, it's safe.
No more landslide.
Yeah, nothing to worry about.
Phew.
That was a close call, Rosedust.
Too close if you ask me.
I think we ought to do something
about those witches.
Yeah.
Do something.
Get those witches.
No, they didn't really
mean to harm us.
Correct.
No revenge.
Revenge stinks.
Morning Glory,
Honeysuckle, please don't argue.
The important thing is that
we're all safe now.
But Morning Glory is wrong.
We can't let others
just run over us.
No, Honeysuckle.
It's better to
just turn the other wing.
Fighting isn't necessary.
But one thing is necessary,
Flutter Ponies.
We have to be getting back to
Paradise Estate now.
I wish we could go with you
because we don't want
to go home alone.
No, no. Not alone.
Oh, no way, no way.
Of Bushwoolies.an,
Thank you for coming,
little ponies.
Goodbye, Spike.
Goodbye, Bushwoolies.
Goodbye! So long!
See you soon.
Bye!
Be careful.
Watch out for the witches.
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.
It wasn't my fault.
Draggle did the magic.
It was Reeka's idea.
I just did
what she told me to do.
I don't understand it.
I've done everything
a mother could do
to make you low
and miserable and wretched.
Forget evil and mean,
give me something.
Could we please stop eating
these doughnuts, Mama?
No you can't,
and don't call me Mama.
Ouch! Agh!
Now come with me.
We'll have a family meeting.
I'll get even with
those Flutter Ponies
if it's the last thing I do.
Help me, please!
Get Bumble and her bees
to steal the Sunstone
from the Flutter Ponies.
But what good would that do?
What do you mean,
"What good would that do?"
It would... It would...
What good would it do?
Oh!
The Flutter Ponies would chase
after their precious Sunstone,
and the bees would capture them.
See?
But Bumble and the bees
would get the Sunstone
and the Flutter Ponies.
What would we get,
Mama?
Oh, Hydia...I mean Hydia!
What would we get?
What would we get? We'd get...
What would we get?
We'll get Flutter Valley.
But there's all those flowers
and sweetness.
Yeah, yuck!
Flutter Valley will become dark,
dank and dreary
without the Sunstone.
Really disgusting!
Yay! Hooray! Whoo! Wow!
I forgot Bumbleland was so
co-cold.
That's why Bumble and
her bees are so mean and tough.
They're-
They're probably freezing.
They were mean and tough before.
That's why they got
kicked out of Flutter Valley.
Oh, look.
Red clover -
Bumble's favorite plant.
Maybe we should bring her
a present.
Good idea, Draggle.
Go get it.
What if I slip off the tree?
Stop being so afraid.
I'll be down here waiting.
Go on!
All right...
Whoaaaaaaah!
Ouch!
You were wrong, sister dear.
Now you get it.
Aww...aww! Uuh!
Aww...aww!
See how easy that was?
It's Bumble's swarm.
Agh!
Not so fast.
Where are our seatbelts?
I am not used to it.
One step closer and
I'll stick you.
Wait.
We come as friends.
We ain't got no friends.
We brought a present for Bumble.
What's going on here?
Can't you see I'm eating?
We're Reeka and Draggle.
The witches from
the Volcano of Gloom.
We have a proposition for you.
What is this
about a proposition?
Well, we thought
you might be interested
in a little plan
that would turn Bumbleland
into a warm place
filled with lots of flowers.
But nothing grows here.
I have to import everything.
But that's the whole idea.
With our help
you can get the Sunstone
from Flutter Valley,
and grow
all the flowers you need.
The Sunstone?
Flutter Valley?
The Flutter Ponies?
I hate Flutter Ponies!
So you like the idea?
I think it's simply marvelous.
But what do you get out of it?
We get Flutter Valley.
But it will become so ugly
without the Sunstone.
That's exactly how we like it.
Do we have a deal?
I'll do it.
Spike, what are you doing?
I'm on a witch watch.
What's a witch watch?
I'm watching for witches.
You never know
when they might attack.
But Morning Glory said
there's nothing to worry about.
Better safe than sorry.
Beware, little ponies.
Strange looking creatures
up ahead.
Follow me,
and be quiet.
Shh!
What are they?
I've never seen
anything like them before.
They're Furbobs.
Our first cousins.
Furbobs.
It's us, the Bushwoolies.
Yeah, Bushwoolies.
Your first cousins, Bushwoolies.
Relatives.
Cousin Bushwoolies, hi!
I'm Hugster.
I'm Charmster.
Charmed, I'm sure.
I'm Wishful.
I wish you remember us.
And we're little ponies.
Except me.
I'm Spike, a baby dragon.
Where are you going,
cousin Furbobs?
We're going home.
No we aren't.
We're picking berries.
The Furbobs never agree
on anything.
No, never. Nothing.
I wish they would.
Where do you live, Furbobs?
Up there.
Down that way.
Across that way.
Over there.
In the woods.
Actually we've moved
so many times in the last year
we don't remember.
Why? What's the problem?
The Stonebacks!
They agreed.
They said the same thing.
They didn't argue.
Who are the Stonebacks?
Our mortal enemies.
They chase us
from every place we live.
What do these Stonebacks
look like?
Like that!
We're trapped.
Help! Save us! Please help!
MEGAN!
He doesn't look
very happy to see us.
We can't stay here,
Morning Glory.
Megan has to be
around here somewhere.
Let's find her.
Oh...
Oh no.
Oh, Bull.
Yoo-hoo.
Up here.
Hey, Mr. Bull,
bet you can't catch me.
Come on, Sting.
Wake up.
Yoo-hoo, Mr. Bull.
You missed me.
Try again if you can.
What's going on here?
Megan,
it's me, Morning Glory.
Look out.
Do something, quick.
Be right back.
Hurry.
We've got to get the
bull back into his stall.
Over here, Toro.
Come on, boy.
Come on, Sting.
Wake up.
What happened?
I'll tell you later.
Just follow me.
Open the stall door.
Okay, Toro.
Come and get it.
Got him.
Thanks, Megan.
Oh, this is Sting.
Nice to meet you.
The Flutter Ponies
need your help.
What's the trouble?
It's the witches again,
and Bumble.
My ex-queen.
They stole the Sunstone,
and if we don't get it back to
Flutter Valley by sunset,
Flutter Valley will be no more!
We better hurry then.
Uh-oh.
I just realized
you're too big to fly on me.
Me too.
No problem.
You hold this side,
and you hold this side,
Morning Glory.
It's a magic carpet.
I'm ready if you are.
Check.
Check.
To Ponyland.
We did it!
Punch, punish,
puny, purgatory...
Here it is.
I got it - purple.
Do it, Draggle.
Turn those
puny little ponies purple.
I'll try, Mama...
I mean Hydia.
Oh, when the furbob gets back
with help,
you'll be sorry, witches.
Get on with it, Draggle.
Make 'em purple.
Skirmin, forster,
mandeboo, marcus, farcus, yuck!
Well?
Oh, I left out a "yuck."
YUCK!
Look what you've done.
You nincompoop.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'll get it off. Here.
Wait...
It's coming.
Get away from me.
It's not coming off.
I'm still purple.
Me too.
Now we have to go all the
way back to the Volcano of Gloom
to get it off.
And if I miss the sunset,
you'll be one sorry witch.
I'm already sorry.
Come on, Hydia.
Let's get on purple.
You too, Ahhg.
Oh, what did I do wrong?
There are plenty
of other witches.
Why did I have
to get Draggle?
Uh-oh!
What am I going to do?
I've got to get help.
I know, I'll go back to
Furbobia and get more furbobs.
No.
Oh, I can't do that.
The stonebacks are there.
Paradise Estate.
I'll go there.
I can't.
I don't know where it is.
Oh me, maybe somebody else
should have escaped.
What a fix.
Everyone's counting on me
to be a hero,
and I can't even make up
my mind how to be one.
Or if I can,
or if I even wanna be one.
Now what do I do?
Oh...
Down there.
It looks like a Bushwoolie.
Maybe he's got some word on
the Flutter Ponies.
Who are you?
I'm Morning Glory,
a Flutter Pony.
And this is Sting,
and Megan.
We thought
you were a Bushwoolie.
The Bushwoolies are my cousins.
I'm a Furbob,
and I have to rescue
some little ponies.
What a dilemma.
Maybe we should
rescue the ponies first.
No, I think we'll need the
Flutter Ponies
to defeat the witches.
Furbob is right.
Let's go to Bumbleland
and free the Flutter Ponies,
get the Sunstone
and then go to Flutter Valley.
Let's do it.
Are you sure
we're doing the right thing?
Yes. Come on.
It's about time, Pointer.
I'm famished.
Oh, so tasty.
Without the Sunstone,
it's back to the old ways,
Flowers are hard
to come by around here.
Not for long.
Bring me the Flutter Ponies!
What do you
want with us now, Bumble?
I want the Sunstone,
and you,
right here in Bumbleland
to keep Flutter Valley alive.
The Sunstone
belongs to us.
Yeah, you stole it!
No matter.
The Sunstone must be retrieved
or it will do
none of us any good.
Suppose we help
you dig it up.
Will you give it back to us?
Give it?
Give...
Give it back?
You will dig it up
because you are my prisoners.
Let the work begin!
Darn.
I thought I had it that time.
Make the hole bigger.
If we could just get the honey
off our wings we could fly.
Then we could do
something about this.
I have a better idea!
Be careful, Honeysuckle.
Hey, where do you
think you're going?
Er... I'm just thirsty.
It's hard work.
Hey!
Hey, what is going on here?
Let me down.
No, no don't let me down.
Help!
You're not going anywhere,
Bumble.
Not until we get the Sunstone
and go back to Flutter Valley.
You'll never get away
with this.
Pointer, do something.
I'll save you,
your Bumbleness.
No, Pointer.
Not that way.
No!
Get the Flutter Ponies!
Oh!
Whoopsy...
Help!
Honeysuckle...
That shell!
Maybe I can move it
with my unicorn magic,
and put it between
these jaws to stop them.
Try it, Buttons.
Hurry!
All right!
It's working!
That's it, Buttons.
Take it nice and slow.
You saved our lives,
Buttons.
Or bought us some time anyway.
Now if we can just get loose
before that shell gives out,
maybe we can stop Squirk
from turning Ponyland
into a giant aquarium.
Then, by cracky,
it's up to us, Pluma.
Maybe together,
we're strong enough.
Oh my!
I'll try it, grandfather,
but I just don't know
if I... I mean...
I'm not sure I can.
Doh, for Christ's sake, girl
Just quit belly-aching
and change!
It's working!
Your ropes, they're breaking.
Way to go, Grandpa.
Quick, everybody.
Jump!
Make your air bubbles, Fizzy,
so we can get out of here.
It won't be long now, Squirk.
Soon the whole land will be
flooded, and you'll rule again.
I know that, Crank.
Shut up!
I wonder if Squirk's found
the Flashstone yet.
We can find out easily enough.
Come on!
There's your answer.
How are we ever going
to stop him?
I think I know.
Come on!
Let's go back to Paradise Estate
and I'll show you.
It won't be long before the
water reaches here, I reckon.
We're not accomplishing anything
waiting for it.
Just hang on, Gusty.
It's Danny we're waiting for.
He thinks
he's figured out a way
to get the Flashstone
away from Squirk.
Look!
My nets!
Right, we can catch
Squirk and Crank in 'em
just like a couple of fish.
We just have to flush
those two out of the water
long enough to drop
the nets on 'em.
I think I know
a way to do that.
Okay, but we've still got to get
the Flashstone.
Leave that part to me.
There's no trace of Squirk.
You sure?
We've looked everywhere.
Then he must be down
there somewhere.
Keep circling and wait
for our signal.
Okay, Pluma,
you know what to do.
Oh, can't I do it once, Squirk?
Come on,
I never get to do nothing.
That's because I'm ruler,
and you're not.
Oh, I never get nothing to do.
Hey boss, look!
Let's check it out.
You! You've escaped!
Yes!
But we, uh,
we've come here to ask you...
that is, tell you actually,
that... well,
it's okay if you...uh,
if you want to rule us.
You've got
to be kidding.
Just stop flooding the land,
Squirk,
and we'll do whatever you want.
Maybe you'll even be,
you know, a good ruler.
Just don't get us wet, okay?
There he is.
The signal!
Let's go!
As the ruler's best friend,
I'd just like to say...
Shut up!
I'm so glad
you've all seen the light...
so to speak.
Uh, could I say one thing,
your Squirkiness?
What?
Drop it!
Hey! No! Agh!
Okay, Buttons,
do your stuff.
Get them, Squirk!
Blast them!
They can't do this to a ruler!
Shut up, and quit splashing.
You're lousing up my aim.
Hey!
Wind Whistler,
let's move.
Come back with my Flashstone!
Okay, Wind Whistler,
now we finish the job.
Here goes!
She's stopping the flood.
Do it again, Megan.
Make it go away.
Oh no...
The tide has turned, boss.
Agh! Do something!
You're the ruler,
you do something.
Well done, Megan.
Magnificent!
Not quite done. Yet.
But why did you destroy
the Flashstone, Megan?
A power like the Flashstone's
can be used for evil
too easily, Fizzy.
We're all much
better off without it.
Maybe, but we couldn't have
gotten our home back without it.
That's right,
our home's okay now.
See, Baby Heart Throb?
I told you
it would be all right.
And I do hope you can forgive
me for pretending to be a ghost.
Well, next time you'll know that
we're your friends,
and you can trust us.
Speaking of home,
well, it's high time
we went back to ours.
Goodbye, everybody.
And thank you.
Thank you all for your help.
Goodbye! See you! Bye-bye!
Rooooaaaghhhr!
Our beloved Valley is no more,
Megan.
We'll never save it now.
There's still time,
Rosedust.
All we have to do is
get past Ahhg.
That's all?
If we would have done something
about the witches
in the first place,
this never would have happened.
We'll find a way to get the
Sunstone back in place,
you'll see.
That's it.
The Stonebacks.
What about the Stonebacks?
With their help,
we can tunnel under Ahhg,
and get into the valley
that way.
What do you say, Stonebacks?
Can you do it?
Come on! We've got to
go where he can't see us.
Come on, Flutter Ponies.
We can help too.
I don't hear the tinkle
of Utter Flutter any more.
That's 'cause
Ahhgy's doing his job.
Nobody's getting into
this valley now.
To the setting sun, and the end
of Flutter Valley.
Soon it will be ours.
There must be something
we can do
to stop this from happening.
We've tried everything.
And I'm all out of surprises.
That's a surprise.
If only Megan were here,
she'd know what to do.
If only we had more help,
we could do it.
Megan.
Megan, we're here.
Yeah, we're here.
We're here.
Hi, Megan.
Hello, Baby Cuddles.
Is there still time?
Just. But we
need everyone's help.
We can help.
Yeah,
we're good diggers.
Real good.
Yeah, good.
So are we.
No, we aren't.
What about the Stonebacks?
I told them
they want to be friends,
but it may take a while.
No, right now
we all have to work together.
Together?
With Stonebacks?
Yes, with Stonebacks!
It's our only chance.
Start digging.
We did it, everybody!
We did it!
Huh? Roooooooaaaaaaghhhr!
What was that?
Look.
It's the Flutter Ponies.
No, Flutter Valley was
almost mine.
I was so close.
Come on!
No, you can't do this.
Flutter Valley's mine.
Megan.
Let us out.
Blast it, Flutter Ponies.
Gee, are we ever glad
to see you.
Same here,
Fizzy.
Come on! Let's get the Sunstone
back where it belongs.
Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull!
Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull!
Good work, Flutter Ponies.
You're getting it.
Just a little more.
Hurry, it's almost sunset.
What's that?
It's Bumble and her swarm.
Oh no!
It can't be.
What are we gonna do?
No, Bumble.
Don't do it.
Out of my way, Sting.
I want that Sunstone.
Look out, Sting.
Oof!
Uhh!
Leave the Flutter Ponies alone.
The Sunstone is theirs.
But I want it too.
It grows flowers with
all that delicious nectar.
You're fat and greedy
and selfish, Bumble.
You only think of yourself.
I am not fat.
If you promise to
leave us alone, Bumble,
you can come here
any time for the flowers.
Well, I...
That's very kind of you,
Rosedust.
I don't know what to say.
Say you're gonna be nice,
and maybe I'll come back
to Bumbleland.
I'll be nice.
Oh, thank you, Rosedust.
Oh, what a wonderful day.
Come on,
let's go home.
Goodbye, Sting,
and thank you for your help.
So long, everybody.
Bye bye, Morning Glory.
Come visit me.
I will.
See you.
Goodbye.
So long. Goodbye.
Thank you!
The Sunstone
is starting to work.
Just a few more minutes
of sunlight
and the Sunstone
will be back to normal.
I guess you were right,
Honeysuckle.
There are some bad things
in this world
we have to be careful of.
But you were right too,
Morning Glory.
Even bad things
can turn out good.
Look at Bumble.
Not everything is good.
Look.
Oh no!
The sun is gone.
Without some more sunlight,
the Sunstone will fade forever
It's terrible!
I didn't see that cloud before.
It just magically appeared.
Maybe it will go away.
Oh,
it's the witches.
I'd know that cackle anywhere.
Yes.
It is us.
And we've come to claim
the valley for our own.
No sun,
no Sunstone.
No Sunstone,
no pretty valley.
In a matter of seconds,
it will be dark, dank
and dreary forever.
That's what you think, Hydia.
To the skies, Flutter Ponies.
We'll blow that cloud so
far away, they'll never find it.
Wish you luck,
Flutter Ponies.
Yeah, good luck.
You'll need it.
Shift to Utter Flutter.
You're doing it.
It's working.
Give me that.
Do something, Hydia.
It's moving.
Lerton, momminic,
scronic, blacksner!
The witches are winning.
Harder, Flutter Ponies.
Give it all you have.
Now get the witches.
Run, girls.
Run!
I thought Flutter Valley
was ours, Mom.
Yeah, some magician you are,
Mother.
Don't call me Mother!
Ma! - Mommy!
Mama! - Mother!
There's gotta be a way out!
Keep looking!
Listen--
I'm afraid we're doomed!
Stop this!
Please!
My son..
Mother, can you ever forgive me
for what I've done?
You're my son,
I love you.
Nothing could ever change that.
Please!
Leave my son
and his friends alone!
I didn't expect them
to hate me so much.
What else did you expect
from them, my son?
You haven't earned their trust.
And Erebus possesses
their spirit and courage.
Not for long, he doesn't.
It seems we're about to receive
some company,
eh Zeb?
Yes, Master,
Knight Shade has done well.
I suggest we roll out
the red carpet
and give them all a welcome
they'll never forget.
Capital idea, capital!
Ah, my boy...
You've done well.
This is a fine assortment
of shadows.
Mmm,
very fine indeed.
Surprise, Erebus!
As of right now,
I quit helping you
steal shadows.
You can't mean that.
I made you what you are.
That's right, you did.
But now I'm making
my own decisions.
That's right,
not only is he quitting,
but we want
everyone's shadow back
and we want them back NOW.
I can't afford to let you
turn on me, Knight Shade.
You and your friends
will pay dearly.
The master said you'd pay...
...and now, it's time
for me to collect.
Oh...Uh! Oh!
I'll take care of Zeb.
Find that satchel!
Okay, Knight Shade.
You fool, you're out
of your league here.
The satchel should be
in one of these rooms.
We can't help running!
What'll we do?
The bushes, quick!
Hm? Ah, hahahaha!
You can run, my little friends,
but you can't hide.
Split up and hide!
It's our only chance.
There's the satchel.
Got it!
Now let's go find the others.
Ahh...Oh!
You girls oughta watch
where you're going.
Come on, Molly,
we've gotta stop him.
Uh!
Oh, darlings!
I'm so sorry!
Are you both alright?
We're fine.
Have you seen Erebus?
Seen him? Seen him?
My darlings, we've been trying
to stay away from him.
Galaxy, use your light!
No you won't!
Zeb, Zeb, quickly!
Bring the satchel!
Keep back!
Mm..
I hunger, Zeb!
Feed me!
My pleasure, master.
Let's get
Galaxy to safety.
So the Shadow Satchel seems to
be the source of Erebus' power.
And the longer Erebus
chased after us,
and used up his energy,
the smaller he became.
That's right!
So if we can keep him
exerting himself long enough,
we should be able to beat him.
But we'd need
an army for that.
Well, that's kind
of what I had in mind.
Quickly, I need more.
That one pony shadow
wasn't enough.
I need more
and I need it now.
But master,
there isn't any more.
And without Knight Shade
there's no way
to lure people to us.
I don't care, Zeb.
I need more shadows,
or I'll take yours!
Yes, yes..
Now!
Oh, come on!
I need your help.
Now remember..
I know, I know,
it's important.
Now remember, Lofty.
Stay low until
you get out of Grayvale.
We can't risk Erebus
spotting you.
We're counting on you.
Lofty, shouldn't
we stay lower?
You're right, Molly.
Woah!
See, it's just so
hard flying like this.
Lofty, help!
What a lovely little girl.
Your shadow is just right
for my collection.
There...
That oughta hold this little...
whatever they're called.
Ponies.
Who cares?
This one's no threat to us now!
But we'd better
take her with us.
So she can't tell her
friends what she's seen.
Right. We can't let them keep us
from devouring their land,
can we?
This garden was
only an appetizer.
Yeah! Haven't you seen all the
green hills around here?
What a main course.
Oh, no!
So the Crab Nasties
were right after all.
Ohh! It's been so long
since we've chowed down
the way we did back there.
Yeah. I'd almost forgotten
how sleepy it makes us.
What about her?
She won't go anywhere,
now that she's put down
some roots.
Psst!
Don't worry, Masquerade.
Whizzer!
I'll have you outta there
in a flash.
Shhhhh!
Whew.
Those rotten Flories,
they lied to us.
Wait till I get my hooves
on those...
Whoa, there!
They're too big for us.
We need help.
Only the Crab Nasties
know how to handle them.
Oh, no!
We locked the good guys in jail!
Hello?
Hello?
I knew it.
I just knew this would happen.
I just knew they'd
escape some way.
Look at that!
We still gotta find them.
And for that, we need help.
Oh, my poor, poor darlings...
and the Flories...
gone.
Maybe the Crab Nasties got free.
Oh, of course.
That m-must be it.
No, Posey.
It was the Flories.
Then what the Crab
Nasties said...
about being police.
They were telling the truth!
We don't know where they are.
Okay, you two keep
looking from the air.
But Megan, the Flories
were so pretty
and the Crab Nasties
so horrible looking.
I guess it's like...
when you see a seed,
it's hard to believe
there's a flower inside it.
Well, creatures can
be like that too.
They aren't always
what they seem.
Now take this little
fella for example.
I just can't believe
flowers could be
capable of such things.
We found 'em, Megan.
The lake, the lake.
We tried to warn you.
We tried to protect you,
but you wouldn't listen.
Now, they're your problem.
We just wanna wash our claws
of this whole rotten business.
Please?
I said we're sorry.
We know we were wrong.
But instead of arguing now,
let's work to beat those
creepy plant things, together!
Captain, up there.
The Flories.
We can't leave the Ponies now.
No one should have to
face the Flories alone.
Crab Nasties...
Let's go get 'em.
Come on!
Let's fix these crabies
once and for all.
Oh, my!
Wizard, no!
Posey!
Megan!
Coming, Posey.
No! Go back, Jubilee.
Charge!
That's enough.
Don't move.
Release the Ponies.
Release the girl.
Or it's snip-snip for you.
Flories!
Surrender...
Time to shove off.
Gotta file our
report on this case.
And your names will be
mentioned, prominently.
I'm so sorry.
She certainly paid a
big enough price.
Her garden's a mess.
Oh, that's okay, Megan.
It can be fixed.
There you go, Ma'am.
Ready for replanting.
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank you!
Ya know... Ya know what?
I think...I-I think
you're all beautiful.
Anything you say, Ma'am.
And uh... ah...
Gee wiz...thanks.
Okay, Paradise,
you're it this time.
We hide and you go seek.
Very well,
but remember you unicorns,
winking out
is against the rules.
One...two...three...
Paradise
never find me here.
Hide with me, Shady.
Oh, no!
Paradise find me for sure.
Nine...ten.
Ready or not?
Here I come!
Hey, no fair!
Baby Ribbon winked out.
Baby Ribbon, you know
winking out
is against the rules.
Now wink back in this minute.
I didn't mean to.
It's okay.
Wink all the way back in,
so we can get on with the game.
I'll try.
She has such trouble
winking back in.
Come on Baby Ribbon,
want you to play some more.
Come on, little one,
you can do it.
I did it!
Okay, let's start over.
I'll be it again.
One...two...
I'll hide in the pool.
Do you mind?
Ready or not?
Here I come!
Someone is hiding
behind that rock.
And I think it's Baby Ribbon.
Oh! Not again!
She's no fun.
Baby Ribbon, we're waiting.
Boy, this is pathetic!
Oh, come on!
She's just a baby.
Looks like she's having
more trouble than usual.
Maybe she winked back
somewhere else.
I'll see if I can find her.
Back in a jiffy.
Something has happened to them.
I just know it.
We better tell Megan.
I wonder where they
could have gone?
Baby Ribbon, where are you?
For that matter, where am I?
Ah!
Now let's not jump
to conclusions.
We don't know for certain
that they're in trouble.
I have a bad feeling about it.
I've got to find out
what's happened to them.
Galaxy, wait!
Oh, no! She's gone too.
Now hold on.
After all, it's only been
a couple of seconds.
The unicorns wink in and
out instantly, Megan.
If Galaxy had found
Ribbon and Baby Ribbon,
they'd be back by now.
What's going on?
I think they'll be back.
All right, listen to me.
Spread the word,
no more winking out
until we know what's going on.
Is that clear?
Perfectly.
Good thinking, Megan.
Come on!
Let's tell the other unicorns
while there's still time.
I'm the queen of the mountain.
I'll wink up there and show her.
Ah!
Baby Gusty, stop!
Oh! no!
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo
What's wrong, Fizzy?
I wanna cross the water.
Use the rocks.
I'm afraid I'll fall in.
I think I'll just wink across.
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo
Hi, have you seen Fizzy around?
She just winked out.
But she didn't wink
back in again.
I'm afraid Gusty's gone too.
She was so impatient
to run back here for lunch,
so she winked out instead.
That means I'm the
only unicorn left.
Let's get the other ponies.
We've got to form
search parties
and try to find the unicorns.
It's getting dark.
We're gonna have to get back
to Paradise Estate.
Just let me look
around this rock.
Buttons come back.
Those rocks look like
they might give way.
She winked out.
I saw her.
So did I.
Tambelon
I heard Ribbon say Tambelon,
then I woke up.
Tambelon? Hmm!
It sounds familiar.
Something to do with the
legend of a lost city.
I'm sure that Ribbon was trying
to reach me telepathically.
But from where?
We'll never see them again.
No, no. They'll come back.
But from where?
Where have the unicorns gone?
According to the ancient legend,
Tambelon is the
realm of darkness,
a sort of in-between place.
It last appeared 500 years ago,
and its ruler, Grogar,
tried to conquer Ponyland.
So what happened?
How did he wind up back
in the Realm of Darkness?
Ah...I don't remember.
But Grogar swore he would return
in 500 years to try again.
That still doesn't explain
what happened to the unicorns.
If Tambelon changes slowly
from the realm of darkness
to Ponyland,
maybe one part changed
faster than the others.
And somehow caught the unicorns
when they were
winking in and out.
You mean they might
be in Tambelon?
Little Unicorns had best eat.
No telling
when the next meal might come,
if it comes.
There's gotta to be some way
to get out of here.
How?
We can't wink through walls
and that door is locked.
Isn't there anything we can do?
I've already done
the only thing.
I just hope my dream message
got through to Megan.
The unicorns
have been fed, master.
Excellent!
Now Bray, we will reach
Ponyland very soon.
Prepare the Troggles
for arrival.
Yes, master, right away.
Oh, and Bray...
...don't dawdle, mmm.
No, no master, no dawdling.
Of course, not master,
right away, master.
We'll form search
parties again today.
I've never seen a storm
come up so fast before.
This isn't a storm.
It's Tambelon!
In the name of Grogar!
Capture the little ponies.
Run!
Get the little ponies!
It's done master.
Dream Valley is yours.
Exactly as I planned.
Today, Dream Valley.
Tomorrow, all of Ponyland.
Gusty!
That rock-thing's
gonna be plum sorry
he messed with our Gusty...
She is beyond help.
Logic clearly dictates
that we save ourselves.
Gosh, Wind Whistler,
how could you just go off
and leave poor Gusty?
What else would you
expect from somebody
with no feelings, Buttons?
No, Truly,
Wind Whistler's right,
we've gotta go on without Gusty.
Well, whatever we're gonna do,
let's snap it up.
Bye-bye, Gusty!
We'll be back!
She knows, Truly.
She knows.
Woah!
Track 'em!
Y'know, Gusty was on
the right track after all.
This one's for you, Gusty!
Buttons, don't!
Betcha can't catch me!
Oh Yeah?!
Another one?
Huh? Where'd she go?
Yoo-hoo!
Over here.
Hey, there she is.
She's drawing them off.
To the Mountains, then, quickly!
No, this way!
Oh, I hope
Buttons is okay!
Oh, I'm sure
she's fine.
Buttons! Y'all did it!
It doesn't take
much to outsmart a rock.
Okay.
Now all we have to do is
find this Eminence guy.
The Moochick said if we go to
the Purple Mountains,
we couldn't miss him.
Greetings!
Uh.. Excuse me,
whoever you are,
but do you know
where we can find
His Elevated Eminence?
You're standing on him.
Remarkable!
This entire mountain
is a living, sentient being.
Greetings,
Your Elevated Eminence!
Uh.. yes, greetings,
Your Eminence.
We've come to ask
for your help.
You see, Crunch the Ro--
Oh, Crunch!
He is definitely out of control.
And it's all my fault.
You see, I needed a guard
to protect the Heartstone,
which is the magical gem
that gives me feelings.
I created Crunch the Rockdog
to protect the gem,
but I neglected to put any
heart into Crunch himself,
accidentally creating a cold,
ferocious beast!
But I discovered
my mistake too late.
To make him indestructible,
I had put a piece of
Black Lava Rock,
from the roiling depths
of the Volcano of Gloom,
into his collar.
It gives Crunch the power
to turn anything to stone!
There's only one thing
powerful enough to defeat him...
the Heartstone!
You must take it
and stop Crunch!
Well, I.. guess that doesn't
sound so difficult.
Where is the Heartstone,
anyway?
Deep within me.
And, how do we,
uh, get there?
I'll guide you.
But, I'm not exactly certain
what will happen
when the Heartstone
is removed.
W-what could possibly happen?
Which way?
To the left.
One more jaunt to the right
and you're there.
It's beautiful!
Take it, Megan!
Ooh..
Maybe I shouldn't...
Go ahead, my dear.
Which way, Your Eminence?
Uh-oh!
Careful, Megan!
Give me my Heartstone!
What's the matter with him?
If His Eminence,
gets his feelings
from the Heartstone..
..Then without it, he's turning
into a major-league grouch!
Run!
Hurry!
This way!
Hurry!
This way!
Come on, let's go!
No! That way!
Look!
I've found you.
Who wants to be
turned to stone first?
You've gone too far
this time, Rockdog.
No, Truly!
No, Truly, don't go!
Stay here!
Go ahead.
Huh? Go ahead?
What are you
talking about?
What's the matter with you?
You really
don't like anyone, do you?
I mean it! Go ahead!
I don't care
what you do with her.
You're crazy
if you think I'll buy that.
I'm perfectly serious.
I've been surrounded by these
romantic idiots for so long,
it is refreshing
to find one such as yourself.
Wind Whistler!
How could you?
Pay no attention
to them, Crunch!
You really don't care
what I do to her?
That sentimental fool?
Certainly not.
Good, cause
I'm gonna turn her to stone!
Haha! I thought so!
You do care, don't you?
Wait!
I'll prove I'm on your side.
By giving you your next victim.
Yeah, that's it, Wind Whistler,
bring me to him.
The Heartstone!
Please, Heartstone,
do something.
No!
It worked!
She's alright!
Hey you guys,
look, it's me!
Hooray, it's Gusty!
I knew you wouldn't turn
against us, Wind Whistler.
Yeah, yeah! We're okay,
we're okay!
Yeah, yeah, fine!
I feel good!
Hooray! We found you!
Stop laughing! Stop cheering!
Why are you so happy?
There's nothing
to be happy about.
Stop it or I'll bite ya.
I bet all he needs
is a little heart.
Yeah, then
he'd be a nice puppy.
Now hold still!
Look..!
I can't believe
how happy he looks!
Well, of course he does!
Well, I guess we'd better get
this back to His Eminence
before he turns
into a permanent grump!
Thank you
for all your help!
I'm pleased that Crunch
now has a heart of his very own.
Goodbye! Goodbye, Eminence!
Bye bye!
Wind Whistler, uh, we're sorry
we said you had no feelings.
And we, uh, we wanna
thank you for doing
what you did back there.
Why? Logic alone dictated
my actions.
It would have been
too much trouble to carry
three heavy stone statues
all the way home.
Just kidding!
Help!
Help!
She's done for!
No!
It's no use...
Hang on! Baby Shady!
It's all right now, Baby Shady.
You're fine.
Masquerade saved you.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Nothing's gonna be okay
until that walking
bad luck charm is gone.
I'm sorry Woebegone,
but you know that's true.
That's okay, Lickety-Split.
No one has ever been this kind
to me for so long as you.
But I've got to leave
before you start hating me.
That would never happen.
It's just no use.
Ahh!
Ahhh!
No!
I'm sorry all these terrible
things are happening to him,
but I just don't see why
we should all suffer?
It doesn't have to be this way.
Golly!
It looks like
there was a fire!
Woebegone!
Where are you?
Woebegone!
Please! Come down before
you hurt yourself.
What's the use?
I'm bound to get hurt
no matter where I am.
I just don't want you to.
So please! Go away!
See?
No, I really don't.
Why is this happening to you?
The last time I tried to tell
you, Paradise Estate collapsed.
I hate to think what
might happen this time.
Oh, finish the story, please?!
Now let's see.
Where did I leave off?
Oh, yeah! I remember now.
There I was...
face to face with the old witch
floating in a pond of her
potion
which I knocked us into.
My friends were in
no position to help.
Help!
Even if they wanted to.
It was an accident.
It was just bad luck.
Things like this are
always happening to me.
If it would help any to say,
I'm really sorry.
Whoa!
Sorry?
You haven't begun to be sorry.
You say bad luck follows you?
Would you to be the clumsy
that you seem to think you are.
The world would
be a fearful place
for all folks near and far,
so arm yourself
with charms of luck
that may will serve you well,
for you crumbled your own cookie
and your future
is in this spell.
But, when you have a
change of mind
and believe your deeds
both good and true,
your small black cloud
will shrivel up
and the sun will shine on you.
That'll teach him a lesson.
A curse!
She put a curse on me.
Ooh!
You should have seen him.
He just shoved that ol' witch
right in her own potion... Wham!
Oh, I didn't really.
It was just an accident.
Come, come my boy!
You're a hero!
Nah, I just--Really?
Absolutely!
What's going on?
What are you doing?
Ah! Look what you've done,
you hooligan!
But I didn't.
Sure!
Just like you didn't push
that old witch in the soup.
You don't go messing around with
witches
without paying the price.
Now be off with ya...
Ya little jinx!
I guess I really am a jinx.
There! Maybe that'll
stop any bad luck
that might be hanging over me.
There he is!
There's the little jinx!
Woebegone, this is your fault.
I'd better leave before the
whole town floats away.
Until now, all anyone's
wanted to see of me is my back,
as I leave town.
We'll always be your
friends, Woebegone.
We don't believe in curses.
Really?
But maybe you feel just a
teensy bit guilty about
what happened to that old witch.
Maybe!
You've brought all that bad luck
down on yourself.
How?
Well, you believe it'll happen,
and so it does.
If ya stop believing it,
it'll stop happening.
Maybe that's what
the witch meant.
Your own bad attitude
brought your misfortune.
It even created that
little black cloud.
And when anyone felt sorry
for you and tried to help,
you believed it would be bad
for them and so it was.
The witch just brought
all your fears to life.
Maybe if you believe
in yourself,
only good things
will happen to you.
I am good. I am!
You must believe in yourself.
I am not bad luck.
I defy you to strike me.
I did it!
You sure did.
You overcame your
own worst enemy...
...yourself!
What do you want?
I wish to congratulate
my friend, Woebegone
and you as well.
You have broken my spell,
which means you have learnt a
great lesson about yourself.
All that you touch
shall be plagued no more
the evil be gone,
the good will endure.
Look at your leg.
The bandage is gone.
She fixed my leg.
She fixed my leg! Oh, thank you!
Yippee yahoo!
Oh, thank you! Thank you!
Thank you!
All right. Let's go! Let's go!
Posies' garden's fixed!
Yippee!
Lickety-Split, Lickety-Split!
Why did you bring him back for?
I just had the nursery repaired.
He's not gonna hurt the nursery.
He's not bad luck anymore.
Look! No more
little black cloud.
And I'm not hiding it
under my hat either.
I'm cured of my bad attitude,
so now nothing bad will happen.
Well, I'm going home now.
If the witch's spell is broken
that means my village
has been restored.
Have a safe journey.
I will. Thanks to you.
It's okay.
It could happen to anyone.
So he's a little clumsy.
Well, nobody's perfect.
I just can't imagine a better
day for playing polo, can you?
I've never been
very good at polo.
Polo is not difficult.
Keeping the ball in play
is a simple matter
of potential energy
meeting mass and being converted
into kinetic energy.
Huh?
What Wind Whistler means,
Shady,
is just whap it
with your nose.
Here it comes!
Oh, oh, oh!
Uh!
No!
I'm just not cut out
for this stuff.
Come on, Shady!
It's not that hard.
You just have to keep
your eye on the ball.
I've got it!
I object!
The rules explicitly state
that the ball may not be
engaged by unicorn magic.
Don't panic.
I'll get it down...
As soon as I figure out how.
Perhaps I can be of assistance?
I've never had one get
away from me before.
Uh-oh!
Hey!
Uh!
Where are we?
Anybody see our ball?
I can't even see my feet!
What is this place?
It is called
the Mystificent Forest.
And there are those who still
hold to the hypothesis
that a strange enclave
flourishes beyond.
Huh?
I'm simply saying
there may be other beings
who live in this forest.
W-w-what do you mean "beings"?
Gnome-like creatures
called Dell Dwellers
who actually live below
the forest floor.
They are the caretakers
of the forest.
They do magnificent work
making rough lumps of rock
into the smooth stones
Danny likes to skip on the
lake.
And where do you suppose these
huge oak trees come from?
Were it not for the
Dell Dwellers,
the forest might not
have any trees at all.
They are very orderly and
well-balanced society.
And they do all this work
without any glory or reward.
You don't think they're
dangerous, do you?
Maybe we've gone
as far as we should.
I want to go back.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Wait up!
Don't leave me here alone.
Whoa!
This is great!
Whoops!
Ouch!
Ow, ow!
Ow!
What have we done?
Frazzits!
Run! Hide!
Don't let them get us.
Ouch!
Oh, my!
What have we done?
Wind Whistler, quickly!
We must do something!
This is no time for frivolity.
These multicolored
protoplasmic organisms
are ruining the ecology
of this place.
Did I say that?
Wind Whistler!
What is wrong with you?
Look Fizzy, no hooves!
Shady!
Come down from there.
Okey dokey! Whoa!
Shady, this isn't like you.
And Wind Whistler
is acting so silly.
Those Frazzits are
mixing up everyone!
We must do something.
Sorry, Fizz.
You're on your own.
I want to check this place out.
Looks like I shall have
to take charge here.
These Frazzits must go
back into the barrel.
Uh-ho!
I appear to be making
matters worse.
My bubbles work!
But this will take forever.
And I do not believe my friends
and these creatures
can afford to wait that long.
Speaking of friends...
where is Gusty?
There you are!
What are you doing
in there, Gusty?
Hiding.
This is not like you, Gusty.
Come out of there now,
I need your help.
Now, can you make a breeze
and blow these things
back into the barrel?
Please, Gusty?
I'll try.
No! Not that way!
You're dispersing them.
Gently, Gusty.
Please!
Come on!
Just a little harder.
Shady, we need you to knock
the Frazzits into the barrel.
No sweat, Fizz.
Almost done.
Well, that is the last of them.
Nothing happened.
Everyone's still the same.
"This side down."
Hmm...
Gusty, Shady, come here.
I need your help!
Help me turn this barrel over.
This is what is causing
all the problems.
Careful!
"This side up."
I certainly hope
this is correct.
We can't thank you enough.
You saved our Dell
and the entire forest.
Aw, it was nothing much.
That's easy for you
to say, Gusty.
But what really did happen?
Well, when we fell
into the Dell,
We, uh, we kind of knocked
over this barrel.
As long as the Frazzits
remain in the barrel,
the balance of
nature is preserved.
But we inadvertently released
them and upset the balance.
That's exactly right!
But Fizzy took control and
restored everything to normal.
I did?
I mean, how did I do that?
Balance? What balance?
What are you talking about?
As I said,
everything is back to normal!
Steady, steady...
that's it!
Dear me!
I'm not half so good as you,
Robin Hood!
You'll get the hang
of it, North Star.
Watch!
Ah, impossible!
I've never missed a shot. Ever!
There! Clean as a whistle.
Just let me clean
what's underneath and--
What's happening to my strength?
Oh, my dear!
All my life,
my heart has yearned for
one as fair as you.
And you, and you, and you.
My dearest, my darling.
My only, my one true love.
A wrinkle?
My face, my perfect face!
It's ruined!
Graceful flowing,
my little Salomes.
Run, my little ones!
The monster!
And what about the
barometric pressure?
The pollen count and--
Oh, I just wished for
a perfect day--
Don't be discouraged,
Lickety-Split.
Give it another try.
At this point, the only thing
that would cheer me up is a
nice, big, ice-cream cone,
and I mean a huge one!
Chocolate, strawberry,
vanilla, butter pecan?
Here we go again...
Pardon me, but I believe
I can expedite matters.
Lickety-Split would like
a 200-foot sugar cone
filled with 200
scoops of rocky road.
Each scoop 2 to 4
feet in diameter
and the entire confection
should be covered with
2 tons of chocolate jimmies.
You got it!
Gee wiz!
You did it!
Indeed, it's exactly
what I requested.
Of course, you expected
something less.
Uh-oh! Make it go away!
But you just called it
"perfection!"
Make it disappear!
Huh?
Run! Run! Run!
W-what happened?
How'd ya make it disappear?
I didn't.
That ice-cream cone
should have lasted long
enough for you to eat it.
Yoo-hoo! Prince Charming?
Darling?
It's me,
your little Heart Throb?
My! They certainly are letting
this place get rundown!
Appalling!
Oh Princey-poo?!
Huh?
What happened to the words?
Where are the pictures?
The storybooks are all blank!
Megan! Are you there?
Paradise! What're
you doing here?
I wanted to ask you about some
new legends I've just met.
Robin Hood, Chaharazad,
Paul Bunyan.
You met them?
They're only legends in books.
Only-- all the pages in
my books are blank.
Well, they all left the Land of
Legends today
and came to Ponyland.
Let's go to Paradise Estate.
Something weird's
going on here...
and there!
You're Robin Hood, all right.
The great archer.
I seem to have lost my touch.
Really?
run for your lives!
What is?
The monster!
I'ma comin' to get you!
It doesn't look so dangerous.
Come on!
Hey!
No fair hiding!
We're doomed!
I found you!
Monster!
Huh?
Stop it!
Bad monster! Down!
Aww...
Bad monster!
You play too rough.
I'm sorry.
This is what you
were so afraid of?
Where have you been?
I haven't had anyone to chase.
I get it!
It can't help
being the monster
anymore than Prince Charming
can help being charming
or Paul Bunyan can keep
from chopping down trees.
See! You all have different
roles in the Land of Legends.
And the monster's role is...
well, to be a monster.
I don't know about that.
Yoo-hoo! Prince Charming!
Princey! My love!
I thought I'd never
see you again.
Unfortunately, you're not nearly
as charming as I remembered.
It's true.
I'm losing my looks.
And I can't swing my
axe to save my life.
And my aim is gone.
Well!
Maybe it's time you considered
going back where you belong?
But we want to stay.
I can't say I blame them.
That place is simply
falling apart!
Falling apart?
The Land of Legends?
Let's help them if we can.
The land beyond the door
is falling apart!
I think it's because they
left the Land of Legends.
I bet if you all
went back through door,
everything would get better.
Very well, we'll go back.
But not with that thing!
He's right! He's right!
I don't want to go with him.
But has he ever really hurt you?
Well, no.
But he's made our
lives miserable.
But I only do what I have to do!
I always lose, so you can win.
You are heroes and I'm
always the bad guy.
Bad!
So you see, I gotta
be the monster.
Why don't you take him with you?
I don't know...
What do you think?
May hap,
we were wrong about you.
We're sorry.
Goodbye! -Farewell! -Farewell!
Goodbye!
So long! Bye!
Goodbye, Robin.
I shall miss you.
I don't suppose we'll
ever meet again!
You'll see us all
sooner than you think.
We'll always be around.
Tally ho!
Well, I guess everything
will be back to normal soon.
Righto, everything will be
just ducky...
You miss him too, don't you?
Yes I--
Huh?
Oh! Look!
Megan left her books behind.
And the stories are back!
"The Adventures of Robin Hood."
Lofty, it's him!
And look! "Chaharazad's
Thousand-and-One Nights."
"Once upon a time, there was a
princess named Chaharazad. "
Robin Hood was right.
They will be around forever.
Nearly all the little ponies
and their friends
have been captured, master.
Nearly all
is not good enough, Bray.
I want
every inhabitant of Ponyland
in the dungeons by nightfall.
I am especially interested
in the humans,
since they,
like the Troggles, have hands.
We need more slaves
with hands, Bray.
Hands that can serve us.
NOW GO!
The baby ponies
are safe with the Moochick.
His magic will protect them.
The bad news, Megan,
is all the Seaponies
except Surf Rider and Water Lily
have been captured.
As far as I can ascertain,
Forget-Me-Not and I,
are the only two Flutter Ponies
that escaped.
Lots of Bushwoolies
captured too.
Yeah, yeah, lots, yeah.
Here you are!
Grundles looked all over,
I mean all under for you.
Are you all the
Grundles that are left?
'fraid so.
All others captured.
What are we gonna do?
How are we gonna stop Grogar?
Oh, cheer up everybody.
As long as we're free,
there's still a chance.
It may look
pretty dark right now,
but believe me,
the morning is gonna come.
Tell us what to do first, Megan.
Well, the first thing to do
is figure out a way
to break into the city
and rescue everyone.
Any ideas?
Grundles can dig the way in.
Yeah, great idea!
Let's do it!
Yeah. Yeah. Great idea.
Are we there yet?
Uh-oh!
Took wrong turn.
Bushwoolies have plan too.
Yeah. Yeah. We have a plan.
Bushwoolies sneaking
out tumbleweeds.
Tumbleweeds, tumbleweeds,
yeah, yeah, great idea.
Charge!
Yeah, yeah, charge. Yeah.
Yeah, charge, charge,
yeah, charge.
Look! Tumbleweeds!
They are great
for target practice.
Retreat!
Troggles don't like tumbleweeds.
We need a plan.
I've got an idea.
Maybe one of us can sneak in
where a lot of us can't.
Good idea.
Lofty and I will try it
before it gets light.
Be careful, Megan.
Don't worry, we will.
Over there, Lofty.
Well, we're inside.
Now all we have to do
is find them.
That's it.
Now let's push it
out of the wall.
Looks spooky.
I just know it leads to freedom.
Galaxy, Heart Throb,
and I will explore it.
The rest of you, stay here.
Oh, this is so exciting!
Oh!
What a marvelous old antique!
I think it's more than
just an antique, Heart Throb.
I sense power in it.
Umm--do you suppose
it's the way out?
Only one way to learn, come on.
Look, there they are.
Megan!
Oh, I must look a fright.
Do you have any idea
what a dungeon
can do to your hair?
Not now, Heart Throb.
Get the others
and we'll lead you to the gates.
Gee, I hope
Megan and Lofty are all right.
Say no more.
I'll reconnoiter and ascertain
what's transpiring.
Huh?
I meant I will perform
a covert surveillance
and report back posthaste.
Megan's come to show us
the way out.
Hurry!
The gate is not far from here.
If we time it right,
we can get out
when they change guards.
There they are.
Oh! No!
I think we're really
going to make it,
I really do--
then again I could be wrong.
Capture them now!
You better make some bubbles,
quick, quick, quick.
Gusty, you blow them
on the Troggles.
Come on right now.
Okay. But I didn't
know this was a party.
I must get Grogar.
Only he can stop them.
Master, they're escaping.
The ponies and their friends
are escaping.
We have to stop those sentries
or we'll be back
in the dungeon.
Of course, we'll stop them.
Draw near!
I'll take that.
Come on, everybody, push!
It's working.
Give it all you've got.
I've got to return
and alert the others.
Have the Troggles return
them to the dungeon.
Yes, master.
And Bray, if it happens again,
you shall join them!
And then Grogar immobilized
them all with his magic.
That means Megan
is a prisoner now too.
What are we gonna do, Danny?
I don't know.
But we got to do something soon
or Grogar will rule Ponyland.
It's Megan and Applejack.
They're all right.
The Sea Ponies saved us.
It was great.
If you need us again...
...Just call.
Thanks, Sea Ponies.
You're sure this is
the right way?
Sure I'm sure.
Wow! Whoah! Oooh!
Oh, it's so beautiful!
Mr. Moochick?
Mr. Moochick?
Come in - come on, come on.
No time to waste.
Unless you want to stumble round
in the dark for all eternity.
Dark?
Yes,
Tirrac's going
to force your friends
to bring in the night
that never ends.
How can he be stopped?
Ahh, somebody's got to
sneak into his castle,
and swipe
his Rainbow of Darkness!
That's what gives him his power,
you know...
Ah, here it is, here it...
No, no, no.
That's...that's not it either.
What... Whatchya lookin' for,
Mr. Moochick?
The only thing that might
help defeat Tirrac.
A Rainbow of Light.
Do you have one?
I've got a little piece of one
somewhere...
Somewhere...
I just forget where it is.
But I'll find it, yes, yes...
It's got to be
around here somewhere.
Oh, it's the rainbow!
The Rainbow of Light!
But...it's so small.
Well, it's better than nothing.
But of course it is!
And thank you
for all you've done...
No time for thanks, no time for
thanks, no time for thanks.
You've got to stop Tirrac
before midnight.
You've only got, Uh... Uh...
You've got, Uh...
Goodbye, Mr. Moochick,
and thanks again.
Hey, you haven't seen my watch,
have ya?
I know it was here yesterday.
There it is...
Midnight Castle!
Oh no...
How are we going to cross that?
I have an idea-
the Sea Ponies!
Where are they?
They said they'd help.
We've got to
get inside the castle.
No problem.
We know a way.
Hop aboard.
See that gargoyle?
Up there.
Pull his nose.
We tried, master, but...
Then try again.
If by midnight,
my chariot does not roll,
the head of your
little friend will... Well?
Ah, excellent.
But as for you, Scorpan, you...
Scorpan? SCORPAN?
It's okay, Ember.
He's my friend.
We're getting out of here,
Right Now!
Come on, it's almost midnight.
This place is like a maze.
How are we ever going to find
that Rainbow Of Darkness?
We've just got to keep looking.
Hey, where's Applejack?
So, you seek
the Rainbow of Darkness?
It is mine,
and so is your friend.
Applejack!
Stop it.
Run, ponies!
Yahoo! Let 'em have it!
Aaaah!
Seize them!
Whoah!
Get back inside.
Oh! Rainbow of Darkness
that darkness sends,
Now begin the night
that never ends.
Aaaah!
Scorpan!
Scorpan?
All is lost.
No it isn't. Come on, Firefly.
Hold on, I'm going
for the double loop again.
No! Guards, catch it.
Way to go, Bow Tie!
Ahh...
Over here.
After her!
I wish, I wish, I wish...
Throw it to Firefly.
Take it to Dream Castle.
Stop her!
Get the bag...
The game is over, little ponies.
The power is mine.
We have a power
of our own, Tirrac.
Take this.
It's not doing anything.
Maybe the Moochick was wrong.
Behold the Power of Darkness!
Our rainbow!
It's gone.
We're finished.
Our rainbow's fighting back!
It can't be.
No! Agh!
Aaaaaaah!
Scorpan!
What's happening?
He's really a prince.
Tirrac turned me into Scorpan
when he took over my kingdom.
Aren't you going to change back
to what you were?
Not me.
I've always been a baby dragon!
A...aa...aaa...achoo!
Help! Help!
Somebody! Help us!
Somebody!
Anybody!
Stop, Stonebacks.
Don't do this.
Help!
I'll make a parachute.
Oh, Fizzy, thank you.
Oh, we're safe.
Oh, thank goodness we're safe.
Yeah! Yeah, safe! Safe!
Why don't
the Stonebacks like you?
Yeah, why? Why, why?
Why not? Why?
Because we wouldn't
play with them.
That's not why.
It's because they smell bad.
They don't smell bad.
We've been fighting so long,
I guess we don't remember
why we're fighting.
My leg hurts.
Oh, Baby Cuddles.
What happened?
Don't know.
Can't walk.
And it's a long way
back to Paradise Estate.
Come home
to Furbobia with us.
We'll fix you up.
This way.
That way.
This had better work, Reeka.
I desperately want
that Sunstone.
Oh, don't worry, Bumble.
Is your swarm ready?
They but await
my special signal.
A special signal?
Then get ready to give it.
Smirtlab, wilmot,
crock and zerb!
Look, a rainbow.
Isn't it beautiful?
But it didn't even rain.
Proceed after me, swarm.
That's the worst
special signal I ever heard.
Take it to Bumbleland.
They're stealing
our Sunstone.
I knew it.
This rainbow's a phony.
Hurry!
We have to get the Sunstone
back before sunset,
or Flutter Valley will die.
Farewell, Flutter Ponies.
The Valley's ours now.
We're gaining on them.
To the hives!
They've gone into Bumbleland.
Wait!
What if it's a trap?
We can't argue
about it now.
Let's go.
Sting,
prepare the honeycomb.
Where did you go?
Yes, your bumbleness.
Right away.
What are you doing?
I'm going.
I'll get the honeycomb ready.
Okay?
I'll get it.
Oh, how does anything
ever get done around here?
The Sunstone!
I don't think
it's a good idea.
Why doesn't anybody
listen to me?
Let's get it.
Wait!
Help!
We're trapped!
We can't get out!
You're mine now,
my little Flutter Ponies.
And I've got
some marvelous plans for you.
But first...
Sting, place the Sunstone
to reflect the sun.
Bring forth those golden rays
that will make Bumbleland
drip with rich,
nectar-bearing flowers!
By sunset,
Flutter Valley will be
just the way we like it.
Wilted!
Aww, are we getting
close to Furbobia?
No!
Yes!
I think we'd better
rest for a while.
Me too heavy?
Don't you worry about a thing,
Baby Cuddles.
Everything's going to be fine.
Cupcake is right.
That leg of yours
will be fixed up in no time.
Right, Furbobs?
Definitely!
Maybe!
Ahh, Gee, I wish we
could have some apples.
Yeah, an apple.
Me too!
I want one.
Gosh, Wishful.
That was terrific.
You mean all you have to do
is make a wish
and you get what you wish for?
Gosh!
Well, it doesn't
work all the time.
No, not all the time.
Sometimes. Once in a while.
Rarely.
I think we'd better be
moving on to Furbobia.
The sun is going to set soon.
Ready, little ponies?
Ready.
Let's do it.
Lift!
To Furbobia!
Ouch! Huh?
I think it's that way.
On second thought,
maybe it's that way?
I wonder
if they speak our language.
I don't think so.
What are we going to do?
Yeah, what?
Yeah, what?
Maybe I could snort to them.
I heard my dad do it once
a long time ago.
What did you say, Spike?
I...I don't know...
Oh, goodie, goodie!
I can't wait.
More!
I want more!
Don't you think you ought
to wait a few minutes?
I've been waiting
a lifetime for this, Sting.
Get me some more.
Ah...yes, your Bumbleness.
Whatever you say.
Do you still want to turn
the other wing, Morning Glory?
There must be a
simple explanation
for this seemingly mean act.
There is.
Bumble got the Sunstone,
the witches got Flutter Valley,
and we got...
Honeysuckle, Morning Glory,
what's done is done.
What we have to do now
is get out of here.
We have one chance,
Flutter Ponies.
If we try very hard,
maybe we can blow down
these walls and escape.
We can do it, Rosedust.
We're with you!
We'll try anything!
Let's do it.
All right, Flutter Ponies.
Shift to Utter Flutter!
Release the honey!
There is no escape now,
Flutter Ponies.
You will be my slaves!
Yes, slaves!
Grogar's got to have
some weakness,
if only we can find it.
I did notice that
whenever Grogar used his magic,
the bell around his neck
became luminescent.
Interesting!
Perhaps the bell
is the repository of his power.
Repository?
Oh, yeah, right.
What did she say?
She thinks the bell might be
the source of his magic.
Get the bell and we win.
It's worth a try.
But how do we do it?
I know. We'll use
your pocket tape recorder.
If we can get
Bray's voice on tape,
we can use it to lure Grogar
outside the city wall
and grab his bell.
There's just one problem.
I left my backpack
at Paradise Estate
when the Troggles took over.
No problem,
we'll just get it back.
Oh, yeah!
How?
Simple.
We'll take 'em by surprise!
Now listen...
Surprise!
Hi, guys.
Hey, come on, hey.
Stop that Pony!
Yee-ha! Ho!
The window!
It still works.
What happens now?
Now?
Eh, now comes the hard part.
They almost saw us
flying in here.
We've got to be careful.
I spotted Bray
when we were airborne.
I think he is around here.
There he is.
So you call yourselves guards?
This is your last chance.
Grogar didn't capture
all those ponies,
just so you can
let them escape.
Time to go.
STOP THEM!
Okay,
I've spliced the tape together.
Let's see how it sounds.
Grogar,this is your last chance
to capture all those ponies.
It just might work...
if Masquerade can fool Grogar.
Speaking of Masquerade,
where is she?
Wow! Her disguise is great.
Grogar!
Bray, I thought
you were at the dungeon.
This is your last chance to
capture all those ponies.
Okay, Masquerade, run!
Wait!
Give up, Grogar,
we've got you surrounded.
You're wrong boy.
I have got you surrounded.
Uh-oh! He's charging again!
Let me out of here.
Now's our chance
to get the bell.
Spike, wait!
Not bothering you, am I?
Oh, my...might not...
I will...but glony
Uh-oh!
Run everyone!
Run, is going to do you
no good.
There is no place in Ponyland
where you'll be safe.
Well, that wasn't
exactly a big success.
Evidently,
Paradise and Forget-Me-Not
were the only ones captured.
It doesn't look like
we'll ever be able to rescue
Megan and the rest of them.
I sure hope they're okay.
Do enjoy your stay, ponies.
Don't worry.
We'll find a way out of here.
Somehow, someway,
we're gonna get out of here.
We gotta get out of here!
I have a feeling that huge bell
we found in that walled-up
room is important somehow.
The legend mentioned
something about a giant bell,
but I can't remember
exactly what.
Don't worry,
plenty of time to think of it.
All right! We got one!
We may learn
something of consequence
by interrogating him.
Yeah,
and he might tell us things
if we ask him questions too.
We'll help you, if you help us.
What's your name?
I am Drog.
There is no need
to keep me prisoner.
I've deserted Tambelon.
I want to join you.
This better not be a trick.
It's no trick.
We Troggles
were conquered by Grogar too.
Some of us want to see him
defeated as badly as you do.
All right.
But you better be on the level.
Spike set him loose.
Oh! Thanks.
I should warn you,
Grogar plans to exile the ponies
he's already captured
to the Realm of Darkness
at midnight tonight.
We've got to do something.
I know a secret way
into the city.
I'll lead you in.
I guess we'll have
to trust you, Drog.
Get ready, everybody.
We are going to rescue
Megan and the others.
Nigh!
Here.
Gosh!
No way am I going down there.
It's dark!
Well, not to worry!
I'll light things up.
All is in readiness master,
as you ordered.
Good!
Very soon now there will be
no more ponies in Ponyland.
These steps will lead us
to the dungeons.
Even a dungeon will look nice
compared to this.
It's safe.
You lied to us.
You betrayed us.
Well, welcome My Little Ponies,
what a pity
you can't stay for long,
for in a few short hours,
you with the rest of your kind
will be banished
to the Realm of Darkness.
Wow!
Look at me!
Come on sleepies, wake up.
Look, pretty!
Oh boy!
Whoopee!
Hey there, you two.
You wanna help me build
a little ol' snow pony?
For sure! Yeah!
Uh, Truly...
U-uh, watch yourself, Galaxy.
Truly, I don't think
you understand.
North Star, honey,
you gonna play
by yourself all day
or do you wanna help us here?
Yay! All done! It looks pretty.
North Star,
I'm worried about the snow.
It's not natural
this time of year.
I don't wanna spoil
anyone's fun but--
Well, you are spoilin' my fun,
and the babies' too!
Now if ya have ta worry,
why don't you just go
worry by yourself, hear?
C'mon ya all, let's build forts
and have a snowball fight.
Whew! W-well
I hope your d-d-dad knows
why it's so c-c-cold
where I live, Edgar!
Don't worry, Sonny.
We'll find out what's going on.
We wanna see my dad.
Why has Sonny's home
become so cold, father?
Yeah.
M-my wh-whole family is packing
to g-g-go south for the w-winter
and it's s-still s-s-summer.
Don't bother packing.
Soon, there will be no south
for your family to go to.
Soon there will be no place
for anyone, but us penguins!
The power of my icy cold stare
may be small,
but when magnified
by this machine
it creates a wind so cold
that soon the whole world
will be frozen over,
all who are unworthy of living
in such a lovely climate
will be frozen.
And I shall rule
the whole world.
As will you, Edgar,
when you become king.
No, father!
What?
I don't wanna rule the world,
And even if I did,
it wouldn't be right.
When you are king,
you may decide
what is and is not right.
But I am king now,
and what I say is law.
Is that clear?
But why should only
penguins survive?
Yeah. What's wrong
with bein' a duck?
They're weak.
How?
Can they withstand the cold?
Why should w-w-we have to?
Sonny!
He is but
a bad influence on you.
You won't be listening
to his nonsense anymore.
Guards!
How could you?
When you are king,
you'll understand these things.
Is that the best ya all can do,
North Star, honey?
All right, baby.
Give it a good swat.
Stop this all of you.
Haven't any of you noticed
how could it's gotten?
All of our beautiful trees are
barren and covered with frost.
And when was the last time
anyone saw
a bird or a butterfly.
Galaxy, Truly,
all of Ponyland...
...is like freezing over.
Goodness me!
Look at the rainbow.
I dare say it is freezing too.
Looks like I was wrong.
This is a worry.
We need help.
North Star,
you better go fetch Megan,
if you can still
get over the rainbow.
I cold now, Truly.
We'll be okay real soon.
Don't you worry.
Heya, Megan! Boy, oh boy,
I bet you're
surprised to see me.
Relieved is more like it.
I've been terribly worried ever
since the rainbow froze over.
What's happened in Ponyland?
We don't know.
We hoped you could help.
Can ya make it back?
I-I don't know...
My wings are awfully cold.
I thought that might happen.
Wait right here.
For once,
I've got a surprise for you.
Wing warmers, huh?
Ohh! Neat!
I knitted them myself.
Great idea!
Look! Surprise made it.
Megan, thank goodness
you're here.
Are we glad to see you!
Surprise explained the situation
to me on the way here.
But it's more serious here
than I thought.
I don't know what we should do.
I know... We'll go North!
That's where
it's always coldest
Oh, yeah, right.
Just what we need...
To get colder...
Good thinking.
Don't you see?
North is where
we'll probably
find the source
of this cold wave.
She's right.
The cold has to come
from somewhere
and it normally
comes from North.
Come, this way is north.
Tally-ho!
Okay. So we went North.
Now, anybody got a clue
as to what we're looking for?
We just have to be patient.
Keep at it, Surprise.
But I'm so cold.
Galaxy, get a load of this!
It's Surf Rider and Sea Shimmer.
Yes!
And I think they're trying
to lead us somewhere.
Follow me everybody.
This way.
Thank you, Sea Shimmer.
You too, Surf Rider.
We'll have to go the rest
of the way on our own.
The ice is too thick
for you to swim under.
Surprise and I
shall fly overhead
and guide the rest of you
through these maze, agreed?
So sorry, Megan.
I suppose it's just
a bit too cold.
Nice try you two.
But I think we'll have to
rely on Galaxy's intuition.
Come on.
Another dead end.
I am sorry, Megan.
I feel so lost.
Welcome to the club.
We'll never get outta here.
I don't believe this.
Megan, Galaxy, giving up?!
Well, not me.
This way.
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
I suppose we've really nothing
to lose by following her, what?
Oh, my stars! Look!
An abominable snowman!
This is a surprise I don't like.
It will all be over soon!
What the...
This is incredible!
We coulda told you that.
You know,
we'll probably
never let you leave now.
Oh, darlings!
We're trapped down here forever
unless Megan and the others
manage to find us.
But does anybody
even know that we are missing?
Well, I did drop
my sweatband
at the entrance to the cave.
You did?
Good thinking, Gusty.
Yeah. But who's
ever gonna find it up
here in the Black Mountains?
Oh...
This way.
Oh, my dears!
You will complete the work
of replacing my magical cloak,
so my world will be filled
with my radiance,
my own extraordinary,
indescribable beauty.
Okay, start spinning.
Of course,
if you stop cooperating,
you will be the first to feel
the glassy wrath of the great
and beautiful Porcina.
Whereupon
all of your little friends
back in Ponyland
will be happy to do our bidding.
Yeah,
'cause they will be
turned into glass.
So get to work.
Faster, faster!
This way.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
This way.
Oh, ooh, oh.
Maybe that way?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that way, that way.
Could this be the way in?
Bushwoolies remember now,
this is it!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
this is it, this is it!
Well, of course,
you probably do know the way,
but, well,
it could be more dangerous
down there than you think.
D-Dangerous?
Oh! no!
Bushwoolies don't like danger,
n-n-no sir.
Don't like danger?
Uh-huh-uh, no sir, no sir.
Okay. The Ponies and I will
lead the way. Let's go.
Uh!
What's the matter?
Let's keep out of sight.
Why?
I thought once we
caught up with them.
Yeah, I know. But I thought
if we keep an eye on them,
we'd be the back-ups.
Something extra
in an emergency.
Besides, maybe I'll get a chance
to do something special.
What's that?
I don't know.
Which way do we go?
This way.
This way exactly, this way.
Wait a minute!
Follow me.
Come on get to work,
move it.
It's finished.
The cloak is finished!
Now we'll have everything
we waited for.
No more puttin' up
with this bowing and scraping.
Yeah!
Oh!
Come on,
let's go.
It's the Ponies!
Let me see.
Don't push.
Bushwoolies want to see too.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah!
You found my headband!
Oh! Hurry
before they come back!
Are you guys okay?
Yes, but, please hurry,
so we can get out of here.
Don't forget
Porcina's threat.
What threat?
And who's Porcina?
She's the princess that all
this belongs to.
And she threatened to turn
Ponyland into glass!
I thought the Raptorians
kidnapped you.
They did.
But they work for Porcina.
How can she turn Ponyland
into glass?
She's a magic princess.
There's no way
we could stop her.
No!
We'll find a way to stop her.
I've gotta think of a way
to stop the princess.
Her magic is all
in her cloak,
and I must say it looks
much better
since they used
all our hair to re-weave it.
Oh!
The cloak is beautiful!
Oh,
and I'm beautiful too,
don't you agree?
A sight for sore eyes.
Yeah, very sore.
Don't you wanna test out
the power of your new cloak?
Of course,
but what should I test it on?
Ponyland!
Ooh, uh-uh,
yes.
That could do
with some improving.
Kazeem! Kazaam!
Kazoom!
Kazeem! Kazaam!
Kazoom!
Kazeem! Kazaam!
Kazoom!
Oh! Noo...
Your work is truly
magnificent,
oh, omnipotent mistress.
Oh, most fair one!
But, would your mirrored world
not take on an added beauty?
If all the creatures in it
also reflected your loveliness?
Uh, why...
Uh--my feeling exactly.
Oh, dear me,
I know it's here somewhere.
Ah, ha! Here it is!
Beenasim Salaah!
There, it's done.
Oh, my... This is exhausting.
Go lie down
my beautiful porkiness.
Uh...uh...I-I mean my
beautiful princess.
You don't want to spoil
your good looks
on hard work like this.
Thank you, Shrock.
You're so kind.
So thoughtful.
Oh, boy,
she's gone.
Hey! I got here first.
Yeah,
but you sat there last time.
Ahem!
Uh, would you care to sit down?
It's nice and comfy.
We did it, boss,
we did it!
Ponyland is ours!
At last,
a kingdom to call home.
I say we go back in there
and show that furniture
who's boss.
We'd only get thrown out again.
Sweet Stuff, we've gotta find
that peddler and prey he knows
how to undo
the magic paint's effects.
Let me go.
Want baby buggy.
No Baby Cuddles. It's dangerous.
You just stay with us,
understand?
Have to get Buggy...
Keep out!
Stay away!
Hang on, Buggy!
Cuddles comin'!
This is where we met him.
Well, he's long gone now.
We've gotta keep looking.
Buggy, you there?
Oh, Baby Cuddles.
Buggy!
Hey, you!
Come on, Buggy.
Get out!
Quick!
Phew! Safe.
No painted stuff here.
But what are we gonna do now?
Hey, look.
Let me in!
Go away!
Ah!
I said let...me...in...
Face it.
We're looking for a piece
of hay in a needle stack.
Oh, I hate to admit it.
But there's only one person
who can help us now.
The Moochick. To the Mushromp.
Go away! Stay back!
Get out!
Silence!
I say you leave.
Perhaps then you are
beginning to understand.
Paradise Estate is mine!
Magic paint, eh?
Ooh, I don't-
That's a new one on me.
Oh, my word.
Hmm. I am going to have to see
this situation for myself.
Now let's get a look
at that home of yours.
All our things!
Why are they so frightened?
Work you wretches, harder!
It was my magic
which gave you life.
You are mine now!
I, Beezen, I'm now
master of Paradise Estate.
That's him.
The one who gave us the paint.
Oh, well, that explains it.
Beezen is a powerful sorcerer.
His power is in his wand.
Oh, he must have known of
your need for paint
before you even met him.
Hmm. This has all been part
of a carefully conceived plan
to steal your home.
Our things may have turned
against us,
but Paradise Estate
is still our home.
Then let's go get it back!
Oh, for cryin' out loud!
I was just mopped an hour ago.
Beezen ordered me
to mop you again.
Oh! This sure ain't
like the old days.
Oh, how I miss the Ponies.
They were so nice.
So tidy.
Ah!
Get back to work.
Ponies!
Keep the ponies out.
Hold it.
Beezen's probably
got every scrap of furniture
ready to fight us.
And the door
won't even let us in.
Then I say we break it down!
Charge!
Keep them out, I say.
Out! They must stay...
Listen stuff. When you
like more? now or before?
Before!
Who do you like more?
Beezen or Ponies?
Ponies!
Then let the Ponies in!
Whoa!
Let's get Beezen.
You dare trifle with me?
No!
Noooo!
He turned them back to normal.
Let's get him!
I've got a plan...
He-he-he turned the
whole place back to normal!
There's nothing
to protect you now.
With one flick
of my magic wand
I can snuff
you out of existence.
Are you willing to risk it?
Very well!
Take back the magic paint.
No!
For centuries
I've been your slave, Beezen.
But now you're mine.
All mine!
Now you'll learn some manners!
No, please. No! - No power
is needed day and night!
Working me into exhaustion?!
We'll see how you like it!
You'll like it!
This place is in worse shape
than before.
That's fine with me.
There's nothing better than
a sense of accomplishment
to make you feel
all good inside.
What Paradise?
I never thought
I'd hear you say that.
It's certainly is nice to have
everything back to normal.
Normal? Everything?
I miss Baby Buggy.
Awww...
Help!
Ghost is here!
Go away, ghost.
But you called me
to come back.
Well, we...we just wanted
to tell you to leave us alone.
Yeah.
This is my house!
And I want all of you to
leave!
Wait a minute.
This is our house.
Indeed!
How can you ask us to leave?
Hey, what's going on?
Look!
Oh my gosh, what is that?
It looks like some kind of
squishy bug or something. Yuck!
I am the ghost of
Paradise Estate.
Come on, let's catch it.
Come on,
we can catch that spook.
Stop, please.
We just wanna talk to you.
Ghosts don't talk,
we howl ...ow!
Ghosts don't get stuck either.
Look.
Oh, I can't move.
Help me.
Who are you?
Oh, my name is Pluma.
I'm a Penna.
We're magical creatures.
We have the power to transfer...
To, er...trans...
Er...change shape.
Though I seem to
have lost control of mine.
Oh, there.
Then you're not a spirit?
Oh no! Dream Valley
used to be my home.
But today I came here
from a land far, far away.
Why did you scare
us all out of the house?
I...I got you all out?
Every one of us.
Oh, good.
Hey, what is this?
It's a trap.
Help!
Get us out.
Let us go, please!
This is probably
a practical joke, right?
I don't think so, Gingerbread.
Actually, I was... Well,
you see... I...
I was forced to
come here by Squirk.
Oh!
Who is Squirk?
The meanest thing
I can think of.
And he has been for about
ten thou...oh, er,
twenty hundred... No, it was
Well, a long, long time anyway,
which is when all this started.
Long, long before
you ponies lived here,
when all this land- every place
around here - was underwater,
and ruled by that slimy,
no-good Squirk.
Squirk was a tyrant all right,
an evil and nasty dictator...
oh, he was simply awful!
He didn't allow anyone
to say a word against him.
If they did, he used the
power of his magical amulet,
the Flashstone,
to punish them.
And he used it,
oh, mercilessly.
Oh, he was
just plain CRUEL!
Over the years,
the water mysteriously
sank back
into the earth.
Nobody knows why or how or...
That is, well,
er... It just started to go.
And soon, other creatures
came to live here,
including my kin, the Pennas.
Ruff, my grandfather,
was their leader.
The Pennas didn't
come to...to fight,
they simply wanted
a place to live.
But Squirk -
he didn't want the Pennas
living in the vicinity.
No, I should say not.
He wanted all the land
to himself
and so, using
his powerful Flashstone,
Squirk tried to chase
the Pennas away.
But my grandfather,
brave and tough as he was,
refused to be bullied.
Er... Huh?
Hey!
What? Whoah!
And, with great courage,
he took the Flashstone
away from Squirk.
He threw one half into
the deepest part of the river,
and the other half
into what came to be known
as Dream Valley, a place
Ruff knew Squirk could never go.
Squirk hid underwater
for years,
waiting for my grandfather
to get old, weaker...
Squirk didn't care.
He'll live for centuries.
Where's your
grandfather now?
Squirk has kidnapped him.
He's holding
grandfather Ruff hostage
to force me to
cooperate with him.
What does all this have to
do with us or Paradise Estate?
Uhh, well...
You'll see.
I'm so sorry, little ponies.
Oh, I really am!
I don't want to do this.
But I have no choice.
Eah! Eah...eah!
Uh...Eh!
Can't you unicorns
just disappear and re-appear
outside the net?
Yeah, then you can stop
that crazy bird.
No, unicorns can only
wink out through empty space.
Yeah, we can't wink through
stuff like this net, you know.
Then we'll never get free.
It's too strong.
Maybe I can untie us.
Try it, Buttons.
Hurry.
That's it, Buttons.
You're doing it.
It's working.
You did it.
Hooray!
One down, two to go.
Faster, Buttons.
Hurry.
Come on, you can do it.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh no! Our house.
Come on.
Pluma, stop.
Whatever it is
you're doing, stop it.
Stop!
Our house!
You're gonna wreck it.
Paradise Estate!
Yay...I'm first...I win!
You always win.
What we play now?
Not play.
Time for practice to be
the famousest famous Ballerina.
Ra...ra...ra...ra
Whoa! Ow!
Okay, maybe play now.
Okay, what game?
Aa...ba...
Checkers!
Baby Lofty, go get
checkers, okay?
Me try.
Whoa!
I'm never gonna fly good.
Didn't wanna play
checkers anyway.
Yes, checkers!
Aaa...
Baby Ribbon, get up, okay?
Wink up there.
Hmmm...okay.
Get checkers!
No! I'm not all here.
Checkers is all there.
I'm not all here.
We thought we heard a crash.
Is everybody okay?
What's going on?
Mama!
Where are you?
Some of me up here.
Help!
Thanks, Mommy.
Now hold still.
Some little ponies look
a little bored to me.
Buttons, would you play
a game with us?
Please!
Why don't you play
by yourselves today?
How does a game of
make-believe sound?
Make-believe is a great game.
You don't need anyone
else to play with you.
All you need is
your imagination.
I-Imagination?
Sure.
Buttons and I will
get you started.
But then the rest is up to you.
Let's go!
All right everyone.
Look at the hill.
Something special will be
coming over at any second.
Just grass there.
Ribbon and I'll send our very
favorite old toy over the hill.
Oh, it's a wonderful red ball
that can be anything
you want it to be.
Anything? In the whole world?
Anything.
It's all up to you.
This gonna be fun.
What ball can it be?
Maybe...maybe...
Who are you?
Your very own special
playmate, Baby Tiddlywinks.
And I know a place filled with
the best toys and games
in the whole world.
Oh! Boy!
Just close your eyes, we'll
be there in a flash.
Wow! Look at all the toys.
In this place, there's nothing
to do but play all day.
What's this?
It's a ping-pong table,
made especially for you.
Get ready.
Wanna play more.
Okay, come on.
This is the best game ever.
Look!
Wow!
Looks hard.
Every room has a
different surprise.
And you have to find
your way through.
- Try it.
Okay
I'll see you at the other end.
Oh-oho!
Weeee!
Which way I go?
Go...this way.
This is fun!
he-he-hey!
I told you, you could do it.
Baby Tiddlywinks likes ball.
Ha ha, shucks.
I'm turning red.
It will be just like that.
Will be just like what?
I was just thinking what red
ball would be like to play with.
Oh, boy!
Red ball is gonna
play with me too.
Yes.
What we do?
I'm gonna teach you how to be
a great flier, Baby Lofty.
Follow me.
Wow. Flying!
Don't be afraid, Baby Lofty.
The sky is yours.
Come on, let's take a trip.
There's more.
Pretty!
So pretty!
I couldn't have
brought you here,
if you weren't such a
good flier already.
Really?
Sure.
And I'm not the only one.
All of Ponyland is
waiting to honor you.
And this is that.
Go ahead.
They're all waiting for you.
On behalf of all the little
ponies in Ponyland,
I'd like to honor you
with this medal
for being the greatest
flying pony of all time.
Aw, gee.
Ball helped.
Thank you ball.
Thank you ball.
Flying is good for you,
but guess what I'm gonna do?
Oh...
Oh, what are you gonna
do, Baby Ribbon?
I'm not sure.
Wow.
Wow!
What are you?
I'm your good luck charm.
Try winking out now.
Okay, here goes.
Wow! I did it.
Better try again.
You see, Baby Ribbon, you
can wink in and out.
Yeah!
Now, give it a real test.
Watch this.
Yay!
Did it!
Welcome to Baby Ribbon
School of Winking.
It's good. Bye.
What Baby Ribbon means is that
you're now all expert winkers.
And now that you've graduated,
she's going to wink herself
to a tropical vacation.
Have a good time, Baby Ribbon.
Thanks ball.
So long!
That was fun.
Where ball?
Maybe, it wasn't any ball.
Maybe, it was imagination.
Imagination?
Yeah.
Baby imagine anything.
Naptime everyone, naptime.
So, did you have fun
playing by yourselves?
Yeah.
I guess you did.
Now, it's time for your nap.
Okay.
See you later. Bye, bye. Bye.
They really enjoyed themselves.
What...what happened
to the red ball?
I didn't see it
with the baby ponies,
and I know
we sent it over the hill.
Ribbon, look!
Oh, boy! this is fun. Fun, yeah!
Fun, Yeah. Yeah, yeah! Fun, fun.
Gosh, that looks like fun.
Come, join us.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Join us.
Ouch
Yeah! Ouch, ouch.
Ah, how about tag instead?
What's tag?
Yeah, what's tag, what's tag?
Huh! How do you play it?
It's easy, I'll be "it".
Everyone runs away
from whoever is "it" and...
Wait!
I didn't tell you the rules.
I'm supposed to tag you.
Was it something I said?
Well, excuse me!
Aah
Hah!
Oh, gosh,
I'm terribly sorry.
Huh!
Can I help?
I really didn't mean
to get in your way.
Thank you, but NO!
This is not a job for amateurs!
If you're finished,
we could play a game.
Any game, your choice.
A game?
I've got better things to do
with my time than play games!
Hi, Fizzy.
Ah! Oh...
What are you doing?
I've lost Ribbon...
...or is it Galaxy?
Well, oh, shoot.
I don't even remember
where home base is.
You're playing hide and seek?
Oh, do let me play too!
For sure!
We'll start over.
Olly Olly oxen free!
Sweet Stuff wants to play!
She said she'd be "it"!
Huh?
Gosh,
I didn't say that exactly...
Sweet Stuff didn't
really say that, Fizzy.
Uh...well,
I uh, was thinking that
when you read
my mind Ribbon, but...
That's all right.
I'll be "it".
Okay, everybody.
I'll count to twenty,
and then come looking for you.
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13...
18, 19, 20!
Okay, here I come,
ready or not!
Excuse me!
Oh, no!
It isn't bad enough
to stand on my acorns.
You have to lie on them too?
Shhhh!
I'm playing a game and I...
A game?
You call this a game?
You don't understand.
Well, hello-oo!
Hi! I guess,
I'm "it" now, huh?
That's right!
18...19...20.
Okay, here I come!
I hear somebody.
Huh?
Huh?
Hmm...
I guess hide and seek just
isn't a game for Earth Ponies.
Gusty's right.
I'm not good enough.
Look, everybody,
let's make a new rule
that you can't wink in or out.
No, no! I don't want to spoil
the game for the rest of you.
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo
Wanna play with us?
A game?
Oh, that would be great.
Oh,
but I can't swim very well.
Oh, you can play
right where you are.
Go Sunshower!
That's it,
hit it, Water Lily.
Get that.
Ugh! Oof!
Oh, I get it now.
I'm being used as a goal post.
I'm sorry, but I don't
wanna play anymore.
Okay, these are
the lists of items to find.
Choose a partner,
and the first team to return
with the most items wins.
You have until sunset.
A purple cone, a sea shell...
I trust
it will not be difficult.
Oh, I know where to find that!
Want to join the
scavenger hunt, Sweet Stuff?
Well...
Of course you do.
Now who needs a partner?
Whizzer?
Come on,
you can be with me.
What is this last item, Megan?
Something that is one
even when it is many...
But that is illogical.
You'll know it when you see it,
and that's all I'm gonna say.
Next on the list
is a sea shell.
Let me get the shell.
I haven't had a chance
to find anything yet.
You can find it, but you're
gonna have to find it fast!
I'll find it,
and I'll find it...first.
Oh!
It's okay,
I've found the sea shells.
Now what's next?
A book with a red cover.
Okay, let's go back
to Paradise Estate
and check the library.
I can't keep up
with you, Whizzer.
You go on by yourself.
You go get the book then,
I'll get the next item.
No, I'll just hold you back.
You go on.
I'm sorry!
I'm no good at anything.
I think I'd just better go home.
Help! Help!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
help, help, help!
How'd you get up there?
Bushwoolies playing tag.
Ran into Truly.
Yeah, yeah! Ran into Truly!
Smack into her.
Asked if we could help...
Yeah, yeah, yeah
help, help!
And she said
we could go fly a kite.
Yeah, fly a kite, fly a kite!
Hang on, Bushwoolies!
Okay, get ready to let go
of the string.
No, no...there's too many of you
to catch at once.
Let go of the string
one by one.
One. By. One?
What's that? Huh?
Yeah, what's that?
Okay,
just don't go anywhere.
Bushwoolies
not going anywhere.
Yeah, nowhere,
nowhere, yeah.
All of you do
everything like you're one.
Weee Weee.
Yeah Weee.
Hey!
You're the treasure!
We're the treasure?
Yeah, we're the treasure!
Yeah, we're rich, we're rich,
we're rich, we're rich!
We're rich, we're rich,
we're rich, we're rich!
We're rich, we're rich,
we're rich, we're rich!
If you come with me,
we can win the treasure hunt.
Uh-oh! We have to hurry.
Come on.
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Yay!
Well, you have the most treasure
so far--
everything but the last riddle.
Marvelous.
Hey, wait you come over and see
the stuff in this pile, Megan!
They're all real treasures.
Where's Sweet Stuff, Whizzer?
I thought she was your partner.
Ah... well, um, actually, well,
she thought it would be
better to separate.
But I bet Sweet Stuff
and I can still win.
If she gets back in time.
Oh, here she comes now.
And look who's with her.
Oh, wow! Look over there.
Hey, what are the Bushwoolies
doing here?
They're not part of the game.
Oh, yes they are.
They're the last item.
I don't believe it!
What?
Impossible.
Congratulations, Sweet Stuff!
You've won the game.
You figured out that
the bushwoolies are...
...Something that is one,
even when it is many.
Congratulations!
That's great! Yeah! Wonderful.
Dig in, everybody.
Oh, yeah. I love Ice cream!
Love ice cream, oh boy.
Ice cream was for eating,
not playing in.
We're supposed to eat ice cream?
Yeah. Not to eat?
Not in here?
Uh-oh, we're sorry.
Uh-oh, sorry, sorry,
didn't know! Yeah, sorry!
Don't worry.
It's all right if you like to do
things differently from us!
Ooh, agh, ouch! Ow,
ooh, ahh, ouch!
Excuse me...
Uh, I think you'd better
wake up, your Bumbleness.
WAKE UP, YOU BUMBLEHEAD!
W...wh...what? Who? What?
What is it? What is it?
It's me, your Bumbleness.
I...I...I'm really sorry,
but I think you should know
that the Sunstone is
burning up the flowers.
Don't be ridiculous.
It's just heating them up.
But it burned my finger.
See.
Then be more careful next time.
Now be gone.
I'm not through
taking my nap.
I tried to warn her.
I really did.
It's getting awfully
warm in here.
What's going on outside?
Hey, watch where
you're dripping.
Sorry, Honeysuckle.
But there's nothing I can do.
There's nothing any of us
can do.
We could be stuck here forever.
Be brave, Flutter Ponies.
When Morning Glory
reaches Paradise Estate,
the little ponies will help us.
If Morning Glory
reaches Paradise Estate!
Sting,
can we talk for a minute?
What is it? I'm busy.
Well, if you keep the Sunstone,
we won't have a home anymore.
By sunset it will
wilt away to nothing.
You're breaking my heart,
Morning Glory.
Look, I just do what Bumble
tells me to do, understand?
Even if she
tells you to do bad things?
I'm good at bad things.
See?
But wouldn't it be more fun to
fly gracefully through the sky,
and play with your friends
in the white puffy clouds?
What is it, Sting?
What's wrong?
I can't fly.
Well, that's silly.
I mean, all bees can fly.
Well, I used to fly,
but I wasn't very good.
So I just don't do it anymore.
Gee, if we only did
things we were good at,
we'd never try to make
ourselves better.
I think you should try again.
I can fly!
I can fly!
Oh, thanks, Morning Glory.
You're a good kid.
My pleasure, Sting.
Uh...
I-I think I'll go now.
I have to try and save
the other Flutter Ponies.
Bye!
Why did you do that?
I thought we were friends.
I've got a job to do,
Morning Glory,
and keeping you
in a cage is it.
I think it's ugly.
You're right. It is ugly.
You said it was filled with
colorful flowers
and green trees.
It is...
I mean, it was...
Oh, I mean it used to be.
Phew, it smells terrible!
And what happened to the
Flutter Ponies?
Where are they?
The Flutter Ponies are gone.
My Little Ponies!
Bumble and her bees have them.
And we have Flutter Valley.
And there's nothing you
can do about it.
Oh, yeah?
Whoaaah ho ho!
Reeka, Draggle,
get those little ponies!
Oof! Whooooaaaah!
I SAID GET THEM!
Surprise!
Whoah!
Surprise!
What are you doing here?
We left you in Furbobia.
I had a feeling you
might need me.
Well, I've got a surprise
of my own.
Ahhg!
Get 'em.
Rooooooaaaaaggghhhr!
Run, little ponies, run!
Nice try, little ponies.
But you're mine now.
What you gonna do with us?
Oh, I'll think of something.
In the meantime,
we can all sit back and watch
the sun set together.
Aaaahhh!
Pointer. Pointer?
Where are you?
You called, your Bumbleness?
Tell me something, Pointer,
do you see anything
unusual going on?
I, uh,
I think Bumbleland's on fire.
Very observant, Pointer.
Do something about it!
Bumbleland's on fire.
No wonder it's so hot.
Oh no! We're trapped.
I guess Morning Glory
didn't make it
to Paradise Estate.
We don't know that,
Honeysuckle.
We can't give up hope.
Don't give up, Flutter Ponies.
The little ponies
will save us somehow,
I just know it.
Sometimes it's hard
not to give up hope.
What am I going to do?
My entire kingdom is burning!
Help!
Ooh.
Oh! Whoah! Whoah!
Whoah! Whoah!
Load up, swarm.
Down here!
Drench the Sunstone!
Drop it!
Not me!
The Sunstone,
you bumblebrains!
Sorry, your Bumbleness.
We'll get some more.
No, we'll wait till
the fire burns itself out.
Then we'll return.
Let's get out of here.
You know,
I forgot just how good
it really feels to fly.
I'm glad I could
be of assistance.
Sting, look!
There's smoke coming
from Bumbleland.
It looks like a fire.
I'd better check it out.
Oh, no!
All the Flutter Ponies
are there.
Bumble? Pointer?
Where is everybody?
What did you find?
Bumbleland's on fire,
all right.
And all the bees are gone.
Sting, please let me out.
I have to save the rest
of the Flutter Ponies.
I can't, Morning Glory.
But you have to.
I thought we were friends.
We are friends.
Then you'll set me free?
No, I can't.
I'm still a bee.
Come back, Sting!
Help me!
Help! Somebody,
please help us! Help!
I say it's a lovely day
for exploring, eh, Lofty?
If you happen to
like exploring solid rock.
Oh, don't be so dreary!
No one's ever been here before.
We are sure to find something
terribly exciting.
Like that!
It says, "keep out."
Well, they couldn't mean us,
Paradise.
Where could it lead, I wonder?
Wait!
What if there's something
dangerous behind that door?
Think, North Star,
before you do anything rash.
Very well, very well!
Oh, drat! Let's have a
go at it, shall we?
North Star, please!
This could be the Golden Door!
A long long time ago,
the most fearsome creature
ever known terrorized Ponyland.
So, a sorcerer forged
the Golden Door.
A gateway to
the Land of Legends.
A mysterious door of realm.
And it was
through that golden door
that the beast was pushed
into the land of legends.
As long as no one passes
through the door,
the beast will remain there.
So reign in that curiosity
of yours North Star.
And stay away from that door!
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I've had enough
exploring for one day.
A brightfully silly story.
I fancy she simply made it up.
North Star!
How could anything dangerous
be behind such a lovely door?
In any event, Paradise
didn't say not to open it.
She merely said not to pass
through it.
North Star, don't!
Oh, how dreary!
Well, that certainly
was a disappointment.
Ohh!
Stand and deliver!
Oh, no!
Hold steeds.
What manner of pony are these?
Aye, who'd be your master?
Does he have any money?
We...we have
no master or money.
No money?
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Hood, Robin Hood.
And these are my..eh..huh,
merry men.
Merry men?
We are North Star and Lofty.
Welcome to Ponyland!
Ponyland, eh?
Jolly good!
They have a holiday here,
it would make my Merry Men,
a bit more merry.
I say everyone-
come out
and have a look.
Ahhh!
This is nice.
There's quite a few of you.
You are not all Merry Men.
No, no.
We're legends and myths.
There's Paul Bunyan
and Big, his ox.
And Aladdin and his lamp.
And Chaharazad.
And there's Hercules.
Uh..Haa! Uhh!
It's coming!
It's coming after us!
Close it!
Hurry!
Shut the door!
I say,
what was all that about?
No...no, it's too horrible.
That creature
Paradise mentioned.
Could that be
what they're so afraid of,
that they all have
come to Ponyland?
Quite.
Hmm, I guess
we should let everyone know.
Ohhh...
Oh darling, Paradise!
Such a lovely bouquet.
I would give
it to my true love,
but, where is he?
Will he never come
into my life?
Oh, Heart Throb, don't be
discouraged.
Your true love will show up.
He's out there,
I'm sure of it.
You called?
My darling! Where have
you been all my life?
Oh! Nowhere special, heh.
Ah, who...who are you?
Well, Prince Charming of course.
And I've been searching
my whole life through
for you, my sweet.
You have?
Promise me
we'll be together always?
Darling, you needn't even ask.
Huh?
Dearest!
Oh, how I've longed
to find one so fair as you.
But, but what about Heart Throb?
Forget the past!
Think only of the present.
Us, together.
Now and always.
Ohh, my one true love.
Oh, my sweet!
How can you pass me by?
True Heart, it's you I love!
Darling, Don't go.
I've got a funny
feeling about this.
Rrrraaaahhh!
There! I just love a
tidy place, don't you?
Oh, yes, Hercules,
so do we!
I haven't had so much fun
since I cleaned
the Agean's stables
Filthy dirt. filthy,
filthy, filthy...
Just like
a willow in the breeze.
That's it my little ones.
And that's how we do the dance
of the seven waves.
Gee-Wiz!
It's a wonderful day
for a picnic, Lickety-Split.
It truly is.
Those clouds have me worried
Buttons--
'Cause it looks like
it's gonna rain, and I might
What's that?
It's a lamp that
Aladdin fellow traded to me.
It should clean right up.
I think he tricked you,
Buttons,
there's no place
to put a light bulb.
I am the Genie of the Lamp
and I'm obliged to grant
you three wishes.
May I take your order, please?
You go first, Lickety-Split.
I wish the weather was perfect.
Perfect! Hmm..
Could you be more specific?
Temperature?
Well...
Eighty two, sixty four,
a hundred and seventy nine?
Uh, eighty two?
Relative humidity?
C'mon c'mon! What'll it be?
Five percent, ten, ninety?
Whub-ah,
I haven't thought of it.
And I'll also need to know
the prevailing wind speed
and the percentage of
the color orange in the sunset.
Look all I want
is a perfect day,
So what's so difficult
about that?
And what about the sky?
You have your cerulean blue,
your robin's egg blue,
your royal blue or
blueberry blue, cobalt blue?
Well, North Star,
I hope you're satisfied
opening that door.
We're practically being crowded
out of the estate
by uninvited guests.
Shame on you!
Come, come, Lofty!
'Tisn't that bad.
No?
What about the legend?
If anyone passes
through that door?
Everyone came through the
door already.
And we shut it behind us,
there was no monster.
Monster?
We don't
have to worry.
Oh?
Then why are they so nervous?
Prince Charming, darling?
How romantic?
This isn't the way out.
Shhhh...
Be very quiet.
The best thing that bag of
flubber, Porcina,
ever did was to turn
Ponyland into glass.
Ponyland!
Into glass?
And now it's all ours!
Yeah! And, we ain't gonna
share our new home
with nobody.
Look!
Oh, I just can't wait!
There ain't no place like home.
There ain't no place like--
What can we do?
I don't know.
I just don't know.
Let's go take
a look at our new home.
This is so great home.
My darlings!
What are you doing here?
Well, Molly and I followed
Megan and the others here
in hopes that we could help
rescue you.
I mean, I could help rescue you.
I mean, after all,
it was probably my fault
in the first place
that you were captured.
I should have stayed with you,
gotten help or something.
Oh, no!
It wasn't your fault.
You couldn't have saved us
from the Raptorians.
Anyway, I think I just might
be able to help after all.
Did you ever notice how much
hair the Bushwoolies shed?
Yeah, Yeah. Shed!
Yeah, Yeah. Shed!
And how much it looks
like pony hair once it's cut.
Yeah! Yeah. Pony hair.
Yeah, pony hair.
If we use the Bushwoolie hair
to weave a fake magic cloak
and exchange it for the real one
maybe we can use the real one
to change the spell?
Yeah, yeah! Hair. Yeah, cloak.
To the weaving room.
To the weaving room.
Hurray!
Shhhh...
Okay, let's do it!
My beautiful cloak.
My beauty.
Beauty...
Shhhhh.
Ah...ah...ah.
Ah, thanks.
Hmm... My lovely, lovely cloak.
What are they doing?
Shhhhh.
What do we do now?
Gusty, you stand on
that side of the bed,
Shady, on this side.
Molly, hold the torch up.
And I'll stand at the foot.
As soon as she moves, grab it!
Oh, oh, all these
wonderful mirrors!
Oh, I must be even
more magnificent than I thought.
Sorry, I think
I'm allergic to pigs.
Oh, dear! Which one
is the real cloak?
Somebody is coming.
Hide, hide, yeah, hide.
Raptorians are coming.
Yeah, coming.
I hope this is it.
Porcina! Porcina!
Porcina!
The Ponies have escaped.
Oh, what is it, Shrock?
It's the Ponies!
Ah...Ah...Ah...
They've escaped.
Escaped?
You got to help us find them
and...and turn them into glass
before they ruin everything.
You're giving me orders now?
Ponies!
Get'em!
Stop, before I turn
you into toads.
Oh, she's bluffing!
That's an obvious fake.
Porcina, turn 'em all into glass
before they ruin everything.
Kazeem! Kazaam...
Oh, oh!
Ah, I-I can't.
I can't.
The Ponies in my crystal orb
didn't seem real.
But these Ponies here,
these living, breathing,
trembling creatures of flesh
are alive,
just like you and me.
I don't have the right
to turn them into glass.
What!
Are you crazy?
They'll ruin everything.
Then give it to me.
All right, you little pests.
First I'm gonna turn you all
into glass
and then I'm gonna shatter
you one by one.
Kazeem! Kazaam!
Kazoom!
This cloak's a dud.
That must be the real one.
Get it boys!
Don't be afraid.
Huh?
Don't worry,
they never felt it.
In fact, they never
felt anything.
Not about you or me, not about
anything but themselves.
I guess I didn't see that.
I didn't see a lot of things
till now.
Well, there's still time
to put things right.
Let's get back to Ponyland
and help our friends.
Okay. In fact,
I'll lead the way.
Beem! Salaah! Sim!
Wait.
Kazoom! Kazaam! Kazeem!
You see, Shady, your bravery,
quick thinking came through
when we needed them most.
So don't you ever
underestimate yourself again.
Now well that cloak was probably
never a good thing for me
to have had anyway.
But what's to become of me now?
Bushwoolies think
Porcina not so bad.
Oh!
Why not stay with
Bushwoolies underground?
We need clever and
beautiful hair groomer.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Beautiful groomer.
Oh, why not?
Bye, bye! Bye! Bye!
Isn't this a great
spot for picnic?
It's okay.
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, look out!
Shoo! Go away!
Whoa!
You're lucky you didn't fall
in the water, Danny.
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo
Oh, so what's wrong with water?
Water is fun.
Watch.
Wee!
Wow! Terrific!
A treasure chest!
They're very pretty.
I wonder where they came from.
Virtually, anywhere I would say.
There are a myriad springs
and rapids in Ponyland
strong enough to carry it along.
I sense that there's more to
them than there appears to be.
Ah, who cares?
We're here to have fun.
Come on! Let's play volleyball.
Hey! Wait a minute.
Where're we gonna get
a ball to play with?
No problem.
Watch this.
Here it comes.
I got it.
Hey, no fair flying.
Good one.
I wanna eat soon.
Hungry.
Hush now, Baby Lickety-Split,
it won't be long now.
Sweet Stuff, are you okay?
I'm sorry.
I'll pick all the coins up.
Go ahead and finish
your game first.
I got it. I--I got it.
I got it. I--oh!
Oops!
You got it all right, Gusty.
No sweat.
I'll just make another bubble.
I only wish I can make bubbles
that are big and strong enough
to keep our popcorn.
Huh! Wow!
Look at that!
Gee, pretty.
Can you do it again, Fizzy?
This is me.
Don't break it, Molly,
you're too high.
Megan, help me.
I'm scared.
Get me down.
She's in trouble.
We gotta do something.
Salt?
Salt has a corrosive effect
if you sprinkle it
on the bubble's surface.
Good idea, Wind Whistler.
Let's go.
Push it that way Wind Whistler.
Over the pond.
Ahh..
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo
I glad Molly is safe.
But I feel hungry.
I wish there was food stacked
as high as a tree.
This is impossible.
I believe the coins are
responsible, Megan.
I saw Baby Lickety-Split
standing on one
as she made her wish.
And the coin glowed
and dematerialized.
Magic coins!
Magic coins!
I think Baby Half Note
might be right.
The symbol engraved
on each coin tells
what kind of wish
the coin grants.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
Picnic's over you guys.
Let's get back to the Estate.
I wish it never rained again.
Never again!
Hurray!
Now we can have
our picnic after all.
I've never seen a storm
clear up that fast before.
I know. It doesn't seem
quite normal somehow.
Posey, what's wrong?
Nothing but disaster.
Come and see.
This is terrible, Posey.
This meteorological debacle
is quite anomalous.
I mean,
it has not rained for weeks.
Something unusual is happening.
I guess I never
really realized...
...how nice rain is.
Not gonna rain again ever.
I made wish.
So that's why it hasn't rained.
Come on!
Heartthrob, did use
any of those coins?
Well, yes.
But only one and it was
for such a good cause.
Our Sweet Stuffs' makeup was
positively ruined by the heat.
And there was this coin
with a mask on it.
Sweet Stuff, where are you?
Over here.
Why are you hiding, Sweet Stuff?
If you looked like this,
wouldn't you?
Megan, it is obvious
that the metaphysical power
of these coins can have
unforeseen and
hazardous side effects.
Not only that,
but wishing on them can get us
into a lot of trouble.
We better find those coins
and fast.
Magic Star, have you seen
the rest of the coins?
Sure, Megan.
I put 'em in my good
luck collection for safekeeping.
Great.
Go, get 'em.
Maybe we can get ourselves
out of this mess.
There are only three left.
I don't know what any
of these symbols mean.
Try wishing for rain on them.
We wish it would rain.
We wish it would rain.
Nothing.
Now what are we gonna do?
Ponyland's gonna dry
up and blow away.
We'll have to go
ask the Moochick.
He's our only hope.
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo
Look!
The Baby Seaponies.
They've run out of water.
Wha-What's that?
Come on! Let's find out.
Well, how about that!
Aren't they the strangest
looking creatures?
They're strange all right,
strange as in ugly!
Never mind that, Whizzer.
We'd better do something...
before they rip up all
of Dream Valley.
Ahem!
Ahem!
May I speak to you a moment?
I said I'd like to
speak to you for a...
Sorry ma'am, no time.
Gotta find the Flories.
Captain's right, ma'am.
Those Flories could
be hiding anywhere,
even in...here.
Now you stop that
right this instant.
You heard the Captain, ma'am.
Can't stop now.
But-but...this is no
way to find anything.
We gotta get help!
Yeah! We gotta find Megan.
Feels like we've been
running for days.
Oh!
Ooh!
We have!
Come on! Hurry! Soil.
Gotta find some
rich fertile soil.
And water!
Can't go another
step...without water.
Look, we're saved!
Rich soil!
Oh! Yeah! We're saved.
Oh..oh boy, oh boy.
Just hold it.
No!
There's some kind of
creature in there.
It...It seems nice,
whatever it is!
I think it likes flowers.
An-and it has water!
If that creature cared
for us like that,
we'd be-be-be-be back on our
roots in no time.
Wait! It doesn't know us.
We've got to be careful
not to frighten it.
Yeah!
Follow me!
Ya all look so beautiful today.
I'm so proud of each
and every one of you.
Yes, you too!
Hello!
Ah!
You, You gave me a start.
Umm...wh-who are you?
Can't talk.
Need water, fertile soil.
Help! Need water.
Fertile soil!
You poor things.
You're half-starved.
How can I help?
We need to be in
rich fertile soil!
Oh!
I have the perfect
place for you.
You'll love it.
I was saving it for
my prize roses,
but I'm sure they won't mind.
Ooh! Aah! Ooh!
Posey, we heard voices in--
Posey, who're you talking to?
Megan, Cherries Jubilee, hi!
Oh, now I see.
You're planting
some new flowers.
They're pretty.
They look pretty sick to me.
Oh, yeah! You don't look
so hot yourself you...
You...you move! You talk!
What are you?
Flories, from far away.
Chased here.
They're trying to hurt us.
Who is?
Terrible creatures.
Crab Nasties.
Crab Nasties?
Ohh, they sound icky.
Shame on them, mistreating
such lovely flowers as you.
Why are these Crab Nasties
after you?
They're mean and nasty.
They've driven us from our home
on the other side
of the big lake.
They tried to capture us.
But we escaped.
And they've come after us.
to hunt us down and enslave us.
We've suffered so
at their hands.
You mean at their claws!
Claws?
So it's you those
creatures were after...
You've seen them?
Yes!
And we think they're
headed this way.
Woe is us!
Help us! Help us!
Don't worry, you
poor little things.
We'll protect you.
But those crab things
don't seem cruel.
Look! There they are.
After them!
Get out of here!
Go on! Scat!
That's it.
Turn 'em over on their backs.
They're completely
helpless that way.
Give it to 'em.
- Hip hip hurray!
Step on him.
Oh, this is too much!
You got 'em, yeah!
I have you at last.
Puff!
Phew!
That's the last of 'em.
Now what we do with them?
Lock them up in a cage of stone
till we're strong.
Then...we'll take care of them.
But ma'am, you've
got to believe us.
We were after them
because we're police
and they are escaped convicts.
That's right, ma'am.
Ma'am, they ruin the soil.
There'll be
nothing left but brown dirt.
I can't believe you.
The Flories haven't
done any damage,
but you, you went and
trampled my garden.
I don't know.
I'm getting a bad
feeling about this.
I think I'd better keep an
eye on those Flories.
Are...are they gone?
Would you relax?
What a sweetheart setup!
Thanks to those
four-legged suckers,
the long claws of
the law are trapped
where they can't give
us anymore grief.
All this land is ours!
Yeah, this garden is
only an appetizer.
So what are we waiting for?
Come on! Dig in!
Yeah!
Hey! Whose hogging all
the magnesium?
Leave some for me.
Say, get your elbow
out of my face!
Spread out!
Well, well, well!
Looks like one of those
multi-colored dingbags
is smarter than we thought.
I guess this'll teach ya
who to root for, huh?
This will teach you not
to steal my treasure!
We didn't steal it.
We spent it.
Niblick listen!
Let us go and I promise
we'll bring you back
a treasure of equal value
to the one we spent.
Interesting proposition.
She's right Mr. Niblick.
Equal value...
I promise.
Humph...
Did she say equal value?
We'll get you something better.
Hmm...
On one condition though.
Huh!
Megan, dear!
Have you slipped your bridle?
We are hardly in a
position to make demands.
If we bring you
another treasure,
do you promise to undo the
wishes of the magic coins?
Sounds fair.
Not that I care anything
about being fair.
Okay, you got it!
Come on in.
Okay, here's the deal.
You bring me somethin' better
than my magic coins,
which ain't gonna be easy,
and I undo the spell.
Can't you undo the spell before
we find you another treasure?
Ponyland needs rain before
it turns into a desert.
I live in a desert!
Look you're wasting my time.
Come back with somethin'
I like and we'll talk.
What do you think Niblick
would like, Puck?
I know.
I think that old troll
would like to have...
...The Heart of Fire.
What's that?
It's a huge ruby in the
crater of fire mountain.
Or he might go for the beautiful
Golden Rose
in the Haunted Garden.
Then there's always
the Emerald Idle
in the ruins of
the City of the Ancients.
Well, I guess we better split
up and try for all three.
That way, we're sure
to get at least one.
Try to get a few drops on them.
It might keep them going.
We're gonna have to go
back to Paradise Estate.
There's no other choice.
But what if there's no
water there either?
There will be, Molly.
There has to be.
This place is full of bad luck.
I just know it.
Ah, you're imagining things,
Magic Star.
It's just an old garden.
Spike. I think
these hedge animals are alive.
Of course, they're alive,
Heart Throb.
They're plants.
Look!
There it is!
Wait a minute, Spike.
What if these things
are guarding the rose?
Ah, you've been listening to too
many of Paradise's stories.
Then again, maybe you
got something there.
Darlings,
may I make a suggestion?
Run!
Run where?
Do I have to think
of everything?
Wait a minute.
I said these monsters
are just plants, right?
Well, plants hate...
fire!
Let's go!
Quick thinking.
Niblick's gonna love it.
I hate it!
Oh, duh!
I mean,
Niblick, surely you jest.
I mean it's definitely new.
It smells real nice.
Here, try it.
You dimwitted dragon.
I can't--
A...A...Ah-choo!
As I was saying,
I got rose
fever for this breath.
I sure hope the others have
better luck than we did.
The Emerald Idol's in there,
but be careful.
It's guarded by a
series of traps.
Why does that not surprise me?
Oh, come on.
How bad can it be?
I'm taking no chances.
I'll just wink over
there and grab it.
Oh! Galaxy!
Don't worry, we'll
get you out of there.
Careful! Careful!
The floor is booby trapped.
Be careful, Gingerbread.
Oh, don't worry.
I'm okay.
I'll have you out of there
in a jiffy, Galaxy.
And I'll get the idol.
Hurray!
I got it!
Yahoo!
No, Puck.
Uh-oh!
Puck! Get the idol outside!
I'll free Galaxy.
Right!
I sure wish I could wink
through this thing.
Hurry, wink out of here!
Wow! Talk about a tight squeeze.
We did it.
We got the Emerald Idle.
Let's take it back to Niblick.
You cracked it, mini-mind.
Nice try.
But you gotta do
better than that.
Once we get to the top, how
do we get the Heart of Fire?
I suggest we traverse that
overpass when we encounter it.
Ah!
She means
We should cross that
bridge when we come to it.
Oh, right.
We just came to it.
And there isn't any bridge.
How're we ever gonna get it?
Can you fly over to
it Wind Whistler?
In theory, yes.
In practicality,
the thermal updrafts from
the lava may make it difficult.
Still we shall see.
Wind Whistler!
No use, I fear.
The air currents destroy
my equilibrium.
Now what do we do?
It's too far for me to wink to.
Hmm...
Fizzy, you can't reach it.
But maybe one of
your bubbles can.
Yeah.
They're still
real big and strong
because of the wish I made.
If you send it close enough,
perhaps we can retrieve the gem.
Megan, the bubble is so
big, it's hard to control.
You concentrate on flying,
Wind Whistler.
I'll grab the gem.
Ah! Ohh! Ah!
Oh! Megan, Wind Whistler,
I'm so sorry.
That's all right, Fizzy.
We got the ruby.
Now we'll just fly back in.
Not yet.
The turbulence is
still too great.
Oh! Ah!
What's Pluma doing?
I found it!
But you destroyed
Paradise Estate.
I had to destroy the estate
to get to the amulet.
If I don't give this to Squirk,
I'll never see
my grandfather again - ever!
Oh yeah?
Well, what about us?
Please try to understand.
Perhaps I can restore
it with this.
Now, let's see...
I mean, it's a matter
of thinking about...
what you...
Uh, that is to say...
You mean the Flashstone will do
whatever he or she wills?
Oh, exactly!
Then do it.
Oh, sounds like
it's working!
Huh? Well,
that sure looks weird.
I'm sorry.
But it's the best I can do
without the other half
of the amulet.
Our home no good.
Still can't live there.
Shh, Baby Heart Throb.
We'll get it fixed somehow.
Do you know where the
other half of the amulet is?
No. But with this half,
the other half can be found.
Uh... I think that's
what grandfather said.
Then let's
look for it together.
No, no, no!
We don't have time.
I have to get this to
Squirk right away.
There must be something
we can do.
Buttons, Fizzy, come on!
I've got an idea.
So, how's your
ancient feathered friend?
Oh, so help me, Squirk.
If I ever get out of here,
by cracky,
I...I... Oh...Oh...
Give it up, grandpa!
Your powers are gone.
Oh look it, Squirk. He's trying
to change shape to escape.
Oh, relax!
He's so old
he can't even change his mind.
Hey-ho!
That's a good one, Squirk!
A real good one...
Shut up!
So where is this Squirk?
What if he doesn't
see Pluma's signal?
Oh, I'm sure he will!
All this water
makes me nervous.
Dragons don't swim
very well, you know.
But I've never tried to
make such big bubbles, Megan.
You can do it, Fizzy.
Go for it.
Wow!
Wow, this is neat!
Terrific, Fizzy!
Now make one for Danny.
Now we may need some help
getting down there.
What's that, Megan?
It's the signal shell
that I got from the sea ponies.
They said use it any time
I needed them.
Baby Sea Ponies!
All right!
Too old, am I?
Huh!
I'll show you who's too old!
Quiet down.
I can hear your
feathers squeaking.
As long as I'm alive, Squirk,
you'll never rule
this land again.
I've got news for you, Ruff.
When I get the Flashstone back,
that's exactly what I'll do.
Why, I'm gonna flood the land
just like it was before!
Hey, where is Pluma anyway?
She should have signaled
by now.
There's the signal now.
Well, what are you
lying around for?
Get going and follow it!
Yes... Yes Squirk!
Right away.
I'm on my way -
right now, right now!
Crank?
Where's Squirk?
He's busy.
Give it to me!
You want it?
Come get it.
Ready Buttons?
Now!
Oh no!
[All gasp]
What in tarnation...
Who are you?
Friends of Pluma. We're here
to help you escape.
Squirk's going to
be mad at you, Crank.
He already is!
Er...uh...um...hi, boss.
Yikes!
Got ya!
Hey! Let go, before
I pull you under with it!
Give it back!
Hold on, Crank!
I am!
I've got you at last!
Wait for me.
Hurry, Fizzy, before
Squirk and Crank get back.
Going somewhere?
We've got to do something before
all those plants are eaten away.
Pluma, can you change
shape and get us out of here?
I'll try...
Come on, Pluma!
You can do it.
Try harder, my dear!
Can't.
The ropes are too tight.
Then Ponyland's doomed.
Now all I've gotta do is
find the other half of this...
Heh, heh!
And I'll rule again!
Shut up!
Water coming.
I scared.
Don't worry, Baby Cuddles.
We'll stop it.
No!
While they're playing cowboys.
I'll just take your shadow.
Woah..!
Oof!
Woah!
That was close.
Hold on, we've got
a long way to go.
Megan, there's no point
in talking to the Grayvalians.
They hate me!
You're wrong, Knight Shade.
We need them to get
the Baby Ponies' shadows back.
Grayvalians!
Together, we can overcome
Erebus and Zeb!
Why should we help you,
when you stand with the very one
who stole our shadows!
Because our loved ones have
lost their shadows,
and we want to save them.
We trusted him before,
and he betrayed our trust.
If you don't trust me,
trust Megan and the Ponies!
They-
No! Go!
And leave us alone!
There's nothing we can do.
No shadows?
You let them get away?
I must have more shadows.
Only Knight Shade can get me
all the shadows I need
I will not fail
you again, Erebus.
We've got to get the
shadow satchel away from Zeb.
He and Erebus are gonna come
looking for us,
because we're the only ones
around with shadows.
So when they come,
we can be waiting for them.
I'll stay here with
Lickety-Split and Knight Shade
and try to get them
from behind, okay?
You and the sheriff
can circle through the woods.
We'd better do something,
they're here!
Now's our chance!
There they are, Zeb!
Return to me, Knight Shade,
and I'll forgive you!
You can't fool me anymore,
Erebus!
I'll never return,
And I won't let you
hurt my friends.
Surrender, Knight Shade.
You and your friends
can't stop us.
You must return to me.
Your friends cannot protect you.
Now feed me.
Give me that shadow now!
Going someplace?
Zeb's waitin' for ya.
Leave this place, Erebus.
Listen to him, Zeb.
He's giving me orders!
Such rudeness,
and after everything
you've done for him, too.
You should have stuck
with me, my boy.
I would have made you famous,
and you could have
supplied me with shadows.
Spare him!
A mother's love!
How touching!
Knight Shade, you don't want
your mother to suffer, do you?
Hey, Boss,
we got 'em!
Aww, we got the
big Cheesies, hurr hurr..
Seize them!
Oh..!
Mother!
Knight Shade, you know I'm the
only one
that has really had the power
to do anything for you.
Remember the fame?
The adoring fans?
It's not worth it
any more, Erebus.
You're a real fool.
Zeb! Another shadow.
This time, get his friend,
who thinks she's been hiding
from us in the bushes.
Knight Shade!
I'll just take your shadow.
No!
Go away, don't bother me.
You!
Because of you and your friends,
Knight Shade turned against me!
Soon you'll join him
in his torment!
I have a surprise
for you, Erebus.
The Flutter Ponies!
They're the army
that can defeat you!
Zeb! Zeb!
The satchel, use it!
Erebus! Help me!
The shadows are returning.
Returning the shadows!
Our Shadows!
Ah!
To think that those pathetic
creatures caused such problems.
But it'll never happen again.
And we have Knight Shade
to thank for that!
Three cheers
for Knight Shade!
Hip hip, hooray!
Hip hip, hooray!
Hip hip, hooray!
I don't deserve your cheers.
I just hope you'll forget
what I did, and forgive me.
Knight Shade wonderfulest,
bravest hero ever.
[All repeat]
[All repeat]
Baby Heart Throb,
please, sit down.
Knight Shade, Knight Shade!
Woooo!
I can't hear a thing.
And I can't see, either.
Let me take care of this.
Baby Heart Throb, please,
sit down and be quiet!
Well,
I guess that cooled her down!
I wasted a perfectly
good ice cream cone on you.
Ohhh.. lost ice cream cone..
Then we get another one
for Lickety-Split!
Oh! We come too!
But I promised your mothers
I'd bring you right back.
Oh, come on, Megan.
They'll only be gone a minute.
Well.. okay,
but come right back.
Promise!
C'mon, c'mon,
hurry hurry hurry!
Oh, my, my...
what have we here?
Ah, my fair young maidens,
how do you do?
My name is Zeb,
what might yours be?
Um, Baby Heart Throb.
Baby Half Note.
Baby Lofty.
Gee, are you workin' shell?
Not really.
I am Knight Shade's
personal manager.
Knight Shade?!
My my, you must be fans..!
How'd you like to meet him?
Would we?
Then, come along, my lovelies,
I'll take you to meet
the great star himself.
It's a pleasure
to meet all of you.
Can we come back and
see you tomorrow, Knight Shade?
Oh, sorry.
We're movin' on right away.
Aww, why you have to go?
Oh, ugh, tomorrow we have to
play in a village called,
Rosedale!
Ye, ye, Knight Shade!
Perhaps our new friends would
like a tour of the campgrounds
before we move on?
Ah, er, sorry
I can't accompany you,
but I've got some
business' to attend to.
Well,
okay Zeb, we won't take long.
We're gonna have to go
get 'em, Molly.
The rest of you,
wait for us here.
Hi, we're looking for
three baby Ponies.
Have you seen them?
Well, yes, I have, they were
here just a little while ago.
I sent them home
to their mothers.
You did! Oh, good.
Thanks for your help.
No problem.
No problem at all.
They went back
to Paradise Estate.
What? Where's
my ice cream cone?
Never mind, Lickety-Split.
Come on, guys.
Let's go make sure the babies
got back home alright.
So, what do you think
of our little set-up, eh?
Nice, very nice!
Say, you three don't have any
musical talents yourselves,
do you?
Oh, I do! I wanna be
backup singer for Knight Shade.
No kidding.. You want to
sing backup for Knight Shade.
Well,
I'm very flattered.
And Baby Half Note sing
better than Baby Heart Throb.
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-tiii-tii-doo!
That was very nice!
But, wouldn't you be better off
tryin' it together?
Rather than as rivals?
See how much better you can do
when you work together?
So, you wanna
join the tour, huh?
Make up your minds quickly,
we're getting ready to move on!
YES!
They're not here and they're not
in the nursery..
Where can they be?
I don't know, but here come
Heart Throb and Lofty.
We've got to tell them.
Tell us what?
That.. the babies are gone.
The babies!
Take it easy, Heart Throb.
You mean you lost
them at the concert?
Lemme explain while
we go back to look for them.
Megan, what do you think
has happened to our babies?
Do you think they could have
been kidnapped by Knight Shade?
That monster!
I'm going
to go after him right now.
No, Lofty.
We'll have a better chance
of finding them
if we go back to Paradise Estate
and organize search parties.
That's right,
the Baby Ponies are missing,
but we're going to find them.
Lofty, why don't you lead
the main search party?
Okay, Whizzer,
you can carry messages.
Now, Galaxy, you come with us.
Fizzy, you go with
the other group.
That was great!
Why don't you take a break?
Woah...!
You alright, Baby Half Note?
Feel kinda dizzy...
You've probably just had a
little too much excitement
for one day.
Oh, y-yeah, yeah, Zeb.
That's right.
Uh, maybe you'd all
better take a nap.
Don't feel so good myself.
Me either.
Look sick!
All pale!
Like ghosts!
Feel sick... too sick to fly.
Baby Lofty!
Baby Lofty, your shadow.
Your shadow is gone.
All shadows gone!
Where is shadows?
Hello! I'm Camembert, the Mayor
of Muensterville.
How can I help you?
Hello, Mr. Bert.
We're looking for a musician
called Knight Shade.
Knight Shade,
you say..
Knight Shade, Knight Shade..
Well, have you seen him?
Possibly, possibly..
Yes or no? We really
need to know where he is.
Well, you're
not going to find out.
Oh, how'll we
ever find our babies now?
Ah...what's wrong?
You tricked us, stole shadows.
Not our friend made us sick!
Now give shadows back!
Baby Lofty right!
No, no..
Knight Shade no thief!
Ah, well, uh..
shadows, eh?
That's some joke!
No joke! Is true!
You laugh, we go home.
Where you goin', babies?
You know, you
shouldn't be out after dark,
alone..
Somethin' bad
might happen to ya!
Nursery pretty, Megan.
Sure is, Baby Heartthrob.
Watch out, Baby Lofty.
Whooooooooaaaaaaaaaah!
I crashed, Megan.
You're not hurt, are you?
Not hurt, uh-uh.
Not good flyer either...
All done, Megan.
Let's get cleaned up then.
Come on, you can all sleep
with us in the Estate.
Ooh, cold.
Scared too.
Baby Sundance,
Baby Lickety Split, wake up!
Oh, what?
Ghost in the room.
Ghost?
No, not ghost.
Bad dream, Baby Heartthrob.
That's all.
Yeah.
Go back to sleep.
Is too ghost.
I get Megan.
Aaaah!
It is a ghost.
I knew
I didn't want to sleep here.
Wake up, wake up!
Ghost!
Ghost?
Go away, ghost.
Leave us alone.
Get out of here.
We didn't do anything.
Help!
Let me out of here.
Megan.
Eek!
Yikes!
Can't scare us, ghost.
Yes you can.
No, it can't.
Get out, ghost.
Go away.
Hurry, Megan.
So what's so important
that you have to come
and get me
in the middle of the night?
What's going on here?
Ghost here.
A ghost?
Looks more like
a pillow fight to me.
We didn't do nothing.
Ghost did it.
All right, the fun is over.
So let's all settle down
and go back to bed.
There, now there's nobody
here but you.
No ghosts,
just baby ponies.
But there really was a ghost.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now let's get some sleep.
Don't wanna be alone, Megan.
I guess you could
stay with them.
Yeah, stay Molly.
Please.
Well, okay.
But no more fooling around.
We be good.
Promise.
We go right to sleep.
The ghost still here,
I think.
Now, Baby Cuddles,
you just close your eyes
and stop worrying.
Believe me, there are no
such things as ghosts.
The ghost!
Megan!
Molly, what is it?
The ghost.
I saw it for sure.
Oh, Molly.
Not again!
It wasn't my imagination
or a dream.
It was a real ghost.
Yeah, just like that giant bear
in your closet
when you were three.
That was different.
Sure it was.
It was stuffed.
Tell you what,
we'll search the entire Estate,
and see if we find any ghost.
Okay?
We won't.
Will too.
Will not!
Will too!
I'm telling you,
there is no ghost.
Boo!
Spike, that was not funny.
It...
It wasn't?
Let's keep looking.
It's got to be
around here somewhere.
And when we find it,
we ask it to go away, right?
That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard.
That's not the way
you deal with ghosts.
You have a better idea?
Yeah.
If there's anything here,
I'm gonna catch it.
This ought to do it.
Okay, Cupcake.
Bring me the cake.
Ooh, looks yummy.
There.
All set.
I still don't get it.
It's actually
pretty simple, Spike.
The trapdoor is triggered
by this pulley mechanism.
And the cake is the bait.
Now I get it.
The ghost gets hungry,
sees the cake,
picks it up to eat it...
Drat!
Er, would somebody
open the box please?
Huh, please? Could you, huh?
Would you?
Here,
ghosty-whosty!
Come out, come out.
Wherever you are.
Eek!
Oh, it's a mirror.
Oh, youch!
Eek!
Eek!
Hang it on that nail,
Masquerade.
I wonder what happens
if a ghost gets wet.
Done.
Well, if it a ghost,
it won't get wet.
Come on,
let's put one over the door!
Spike!
What?
I already
put one over the door.
Oh!
Yikes.
Eek.
Whoaaahhhh!
It's the ghost.
No, no, no, it's not.
Take it easy, baby ponies.
Oh, Megan, we're never gonna
find that mean old ghost.
Molly, behind you.
I don't believe it.
It really is...a ghost!
Oh, joy!
Oh, rapture!
It's the first day of fall.
Look how beautiful!
But don't forget,
there are autumn chores to do.
Winter will be here soon.
Oh!
Do we have to?
Let's play first.
Let's play tag,
okay?
Okay.
Nah, Nani, Nah, Nah...
Can't catch us!
Can too!
Ow!
Help!
Baby Lickety-Split.
Baby Shady.
Help!
Help!
Hang on Baby Tiddly,
hang on!
Ah!
Aaah!
Can't go in,
the water too fast.
Wh-wh-what we do now?
Help!
Rrowff!
Rrowff, rrowff, rrowff,
rrowff, rrowff
Ah! The monster got Baby Tiddly.
Not monster!
Ah-ah!
Big puppy.
Puppy ask if
"Baby Tiddly okay?"
Uh,
I fine big puppy.
You saved me.
Only all wet.
Puppy make me dry now.
What's your name big puppy?
Rrowff, rrowff.
Dogs can't talk like us.
I'll call you Dinah then.
'Cause you're big
like a dinosaur.
Are you lost?
Then come home with us.
We keep her, please, huh?
Please, please!
I don't know.
A puppy is a big responsibility.
And I reckon this one's
bigger than most.
Ponies, ponies, ponies... Think!
Where will we keep her?
Where will she sleep?
Anywhere she wants to.
And what will she eat?
Hmmm.
What won't she eat?
We could build her
a dog house.
And... And she could eat
my cupcakes of course.
Well, with winter coming soon,
and her being only a puppy,
I guess we can't say no.
Never ever gonna
finish baby Tiddly.
No time to play today.
Dinah gonna help us?
Wraff, wraff!
Woah, Dinah,
you work fast.
Now we play!
But first you better wash.
You all dirty.
Oh! Dinah!
You ate all my ice-cream.
Now, go sit.
I clean up mess.
Help?
No.
You did enough already.
Ugh!
What happened, Heart Throb?
This beast sat
on my Valentine collection.
Oh, they're, they're ruined!
I hope tomorrow better.
This house looks like it'll
last forever, doesn't it?
Don't say that.
Nothing lasts forever,
especially my nerves.
I know how ya all feel.
Ponies, please!
We said Dinah could stay.
So she stays.
Dinah.
Dinah!
Come see your new dog house!
It's finished!
So how much trouble can she be?
Not that she needs
to get any bigger, Cupcake,
but you now,
she kinda grows on ya.
I guess y'all were right
Dinah's a baby
and needs our help.
So allow me.
There you go sugar,
Bon appetit,
as they say.
Oh,
but that was dinner.
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Oh, all right.
I can help Cupcake
bake some more.
Oh, honeybunch.
Don't tell anyone
where you got this.
Dinah, Dinah!
Ooh!
Dinah bigger.
Looky!
What's all this here racket?
Dinah got a whole
lot of friends.
Of course!
I'll bet she was separated
from them by accident last fall.
You mean, Dinah will leave now?
Aww, they're
like her family, honey.
She'll be happiest with them.
Tell her she can go.
Tell her
she'll always be in your heart,
just like
you'll always be in hers.
It's okay, Dinah.
I understand,
you gotta go.
Goodbye, goodbye, Dinah!
Well, I believe
you're gonna miss Dinah,
I truly do.
Of course, I will.
After all the
ice-cream cones I snuck her.
After all that complaining
you were doing.
Magic Star's right.
I do declare,
friends may have to leave ya
but they'll always be with ya
in your heart.
Thanks Truly.
I needed to hear that.
Even if she was a big ol' mutt!
Get him.
Whoah!
Don't let the Stonebacks
get me, Megan.
They won't hurt you, Furbob.
Would you rather be up there?
Come on.
Let's fill up the hole.
I can't see a thing.
We know they're down there.
And so is the Sunstone.
Lead the way, Pointer.
Er...
Listen, your Bumbleness.
I'm not really good
at dark places...
Could somebody else go?
What?
Are you saying no to me?
Well, no. No, no, no, no, no!
It's just that you're the queen.
I wouldn't want anyone to think
that...that...that
you're not the bravest just
because you didn't go first.
Oh yes.
Bravest.
Very well, Pointer.
I shall deed
by my deeds,
not by my words.
Stand back!
Get me out of here!
If we hurry,
we can still get the Sunstone
back to Flutter Valley
before sunset.
You can't stay
there forever, Furbob!
Yes I can.
At least until
the Stonebacks leave!
But they don't want to leave.
They helped save us.
I still think it's a trick.
Stonebacks hate Furbobs!
Why did you do that?
We always do that.
Then they chase us,
and we run away,
and we have to
find a new home.
Did you ever think that
maybe
the Stonebacks
want to be your friends?
Are you serious?
All they do is snort,
dig up the ground and chase us.
It's not easy to get your point
across when you can't talk.
Try imagining what it would be
like if the Stonebacks
were your friends.
My imagination is not
that good.
Try, Furbob.
What do you think,
Furbob?
Well, it does sound
like a good idea.
But I do have to check
with the other Furbobs first.
Come on, Megan.
We have to get the Sunstone
back to Flutter Valley.
How are you going to
get it there, Rosedust?
It's too hot to handle.
All we have to do
is cool it off.
We can use utter flutter.
Right, let's do it.
That's fantastic.
I wonder if I can do that?
It's cold now.
We can move it.
I've got the Sunstone.
Which way to Flutter Valley?
They want us to follow them.
To Flutter Valley.
Hurry!
Buzz, buzz, buzz!
Er...
Don't be so upset,
your Bumbleness.
Upset?
WHO'S UPSET?
Buzz!
It's just a silly Sunstone.
We never had one before.
I know that.
But once you taste
the good life
it's very hard to give it up.
So I have an idea,
Pointer.
Er...
What is that,
your Bumbleness?
LET'S GO TO FLUTTER VALLEY
AND GET IT BACK!
It's almost sunset.
We'll never make it in time.
Oh, Flutter Valley
is going to wilt away.
Don't give up,
Flutter Ponies.
There's still time to get
the Sunstone in place.
Don't forget the witches.
What about them?
Oh,
I forgot to tell you,
the witches have
taken over Flutter Valley.
Oh no!
I'll go to Furbobia,
and get the rest of the Furbobs.
Maybe they can help.
Hop on, Furbob!
I'll get you there in no time.
Meet you all at Flutter Valley.
Not that way,
this way.
It's a race against the sun,
Flutter Ponies. Hurry!
Can I stop now, Hydia?
Please!
No, one more lap.
Because of you the little ponies
almost escaped.
Yeah, sister dear.
They almost got away.
She heard me.
She didn't mean to disobey you,
Hydia.
It was really our fault.
Yeah. Gee, we were only trying
to teach her some magic tricks.
I'll teach the tricks
in my family, okay?
Everybody is a magician.
The Flutter Ponies
are coming back.
What?
I said, the Flutter Ponies
are coming back.
Listen.
It is the Flutter Ponies.
There's still time
to save Flutter Valley.
Shut up! There's no time
to save anything.
It's almost sunset.
We've got to stop them,
Hydia.
What if they have the Sunstone?
Ahhg!
Roooooaaaaggghhrr!
Guard the entrance.
Don't let anyone in. Nobody.
Rooaaaagghhrr!
Oh no. Not Ahhg.
They'll never get past him.
But Hydia, don't you remember
what happened the last time?
Of course I remember.
And Ahhg won't be tickled again.
Come here, Ahhgy.
I've got something for you.
Roooaaaaggghhrr!
Drink this,
my little Ahhgy.
And we won't have anything
to fear from Megan
and the Flutter Ponies.
We're going to make it.
It's Ahhg!
He's blocking the way.
Rooooaaagghr!
Not you again?
Rooooaaaaghr!
We can fly over him, Megan,
but we can't carry the Sunstone.
It's too heavy.
We'll never make it
in time now.
Not to worry. I know just
how to handle Ahhg.
We found out he's ticklish.
All you have to do is tickle him
and he'll fold up
like an accordion.
Coochy coochy coo!
Maybe if we all do it...
Coochy coochy coo!
Coochy coochy coo!
I don't understand.
It worked last time.
Rooooaaaaghr!
We'll never get past him.
And it's almost sunset.
What are we going to do?
Roooaaaaghhr!
Never see
other ponies again.
Maybe they
look for us right now?
Let us out of here!
We've got
to find our babies!
Save your breath.
They won't let us go.
But we
didn't do anything.
Didn't do anything?
You've done plenty.
Or rather,
your friend Knight Shade did.
We don't know what's wrong,
but we're not gonna let you do
that to the rest of 'em.
But Knight Shade
is not our friend.
So you say...
Say.. I've got it.
Mr. Mayor, look at the
sick children.
They cast no shadows.
That's the reason
they're sick.
Knight Shade must have stolen
their shadows.
That makes sense.
No doubt they
feel empty and incomplete.
The loss of their shadows
being an outward sign
of some loss of substance.
Please, Mr. Mayor, you must
let us go.
What happened to your children
could be happening to
the Baby Ponies right now.
We must be free
to stop this Knight Shade.
Well, perhaps
I will let you go.
But, Sheriff Ricotta and I will
go with you.
You'll need our help to get past
our nasty cousins, the Roadies!
Nobody comin' to save us..
Where grown-ups?
Can't give up!
Hey...let's sing!
I wonder where the
Baby Ponies could be?
Our babies!
The coast is clear.
We're so glad
we've found you.
But you're so pale.
We're sick..
Knight Shade stole shadows..
Well, he's not gonna get
away with it.
We're going to make him
give those shadows back.
There he is.
Let's go after him.
Where?
He's on his way to his trailer.
Let's go get him!
What is that
in the mirror?
It looks as
if that looking-glass
could use a good cleaning to me.
You fiend!
You'd better give our babies'
back their shadows or else!
We're gonna make you pay
for what you did
to our children.
Yep!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
We've gotta catch Knight Shade.
Or we'll never get
our babies' shadows.
Look at that!
Uh...oh...uh...
I didn't wanna do it.
I didn't wanna do it.
Then why did you?
He made me do it.
Who?
Erebus.
He's a wizard.
He looks like a big,
gray storm cloud.
That must be the
thing we saw in the mirror.
Yes!
That's how
he gives me my orders.
What kind of orders?
To steal shadows for him.
Although Zeb is the one
who actually steals 'em.
He puts them
in his satchel.
You mean, the babies' shadows
were in the satchel
he was carrying?
Yeah,
that's right!
And we let him get away...
Was he taking them to Erebus?
Yeah!
So you see, I couldn't
give back your babies' shadows.
I haven't got 'em.
What does Erebus do
with the shadows?
I don't know exactly,
but they give him power.
Power which he uses to make me
do what he wants.
You see, I come from Grayvale,
a place that used
to be called Bright Valley.
I tried my best
as a singer there,
but nobody
came to see me.
I was ready to give up,
then Erebus came along.
He said he was a wizard
and promised to make me a star
All he said
he wanted in return..
was a little cooperation.
The first concert he promoted
in Bright Valley was a smash.
Everyone in town was there.
And while I was singing,
Erebus had Zeb steal
everyone's shadow -
including my own mother's.
When I saw what
Erebus had done,
I refused to work
for him anymore,
and I demanded that he give
everyone their shadows back!
But he threatened
to steal my shadow..
...and he laughed at me.
I didn't know then
that the shadows provided
Erebus with energy
that gave him his
magical powers.
And he used the energy
from the shadows
to make himself
into this huge cloud of energy.
I don't know how he does that-
it's a closely guarded secret.
I'm not even sure Zeb knows.
Then Erebus made me take my act
on the road,
and he sent Zeb along to
do the shadow stealing.
And as I became famous,
more fans came to see me.
Zeb stole more shadows
and Erebus became
even more powerful.
his hunger for power is
endless.
And I'm forced to help
Zeb supply him
with more and more shadows.
If I don't help him,
he'll steal my shadow,
which would end my career.
But worse, it would mean that
I'd never have any hope of
restoring Grayvale
and my mother,
to the way they used to be.
Please let him go,
he didn't really wanna hurt us.
What do you think?
Well, the poor creature
didn't have any choice, did he?
Thank you, Baby Heart Throb.
You know, you're so lucky
to have loved ones
who care about you so much.
I have a wonderful mother,
but she--
she has to live with
the terrible shame of
what I've done,
to her and Grayvale.
I think we oughta
help Knight Shade.
You mean we should
fight Erebus ourselves?
Exactly!
That's the only way
we'll ever get
the babies' shadows back.
And our
children's shadows, too.
Yup.
And my mother's,
and the rest of Grayvale's.
Well, what are we waiting for,
guys?
Knight Shade, show us
the way to Grayvale.
Alright! Yeah!
Where is everybody?
I think
they must be in hiding.
Knight Shade...
Knight Shade...
Knight Shade!
You've got a lot of nerve
coming back here, Knight Shade.
And you'll be sorry you did...
Four-feet invade
kingdom of Charlatan.
Is forbidden!
Ah!
No escape. No escape!
Ooh!
Look!
Galaxy, North Star, over here.
No, Megan. Stop!
It's a dead end!
Come on.
Maybe now we can get it--
Halt! We take you prisoner
in the name of his majesty,
King Charlatan The Great.
Move!
Sonny, Sonny, are you in here?
Oh, Sonny, where can I take you
so you can thaw out?
All right, through here,
right in this cell.
That's it. That's it.
Trod in there.
I say, you must
let us out of here right now!
Oh, it's no use.
I fear we shan't be able to
tunnel through the floor.
We can't squeeze through
the bars either, Megan.
We've tried everything
and I can't wink
through the wall, so--
I know, Galaxy, I know.
Wait a minute!
My horn!
When I make it light up,
it gets warmer.
Maybe I can make it hot enough
to melt those bars of ice.
I think you've got
something there.
Good work, Galaxy.
Keep it up!
You're almost through.
Yikes, it's moving.
Sshhh,
don't make so much noise
or the guard will come
and catch us.
What are you doing here?
I'm trying to help
my friend thaw out.
This is your friend?
This sculpture?
That's my friend, Sonny.
He's frozen solid
inside the ice.
I thought maybe her horn
could help him thaw out.
Maybe. We're trying
to thaw things out too.
Everything.
Quick! The guard is coming.
Pretend to be my prisoners
and do what I tell you.
Prince Edgar!
I didn't expect to see you here.
Umm--His Royal Majesty,
my father,
wishes to have these creatures
transferred to my custody.
You two, bring along the duck.
If we wanna thaw things out,
we've gotta get
to father's magnifier
and get him to
reverse its power.
Father's built a lot of
booby traps into this castle.
So watch your step.
Huh?
Oof!
I said, "be careful."
Help!
Follow me!
This way.
Don't relax yet.
We've got a long way to go.
It's gaining on us.
It's dry ice!
Jump!
Put your friend on my back.
We made it.
Yay! Oh, yeah!
Don't congratulate
yourselves yet.
We haven't passed
the worst of it.
My father's throne room
is right in here.
Locked?
Then let's break it down!
Edgar, my son,
you disappoint me.
No more than you have
disappointed me, father.
It's my duty.
Stand aside, Edgar.
No, father!
No!
Oh, my!
Well, what are you waiting for?
Arrest them.
Well?
But sire, what of the prince?
I--I don't know.
He shouldn't have
tried to interfere.
He--He knew the risks.
Nothing is worth
the loss of my son.
Perhaps if you undo
your machine's effects?
Hmm, it's not reversible.
What's done is done.
I...blame myself and my folly...
It was my cold heart which--
Don't be sad.
No.
I must face facts.
But father--
Edgar, how many times have I--
Edgar?
Yes, father, and you did it.
Only you could break
your own cold spell.
But how?
Because you love him,
and you proved it
with the tear that melted
the coldness of your icy stare.
It can't hurt to try anyway.
Sonny!
Shoobee Doo, Shoop
Shoop Bee Doo!
Shoobee Doo, Shoop
Shoop Bee Doo!
You did it, Galaxy
Ah! That's nice.
Achoo.
Well, goodbye,
Good King Charlatan.
It makes me so proud
to hear you call my father,
Good King Charlatan.
And I plan to live up to it
too...with Edgar's help.
I'm sure you will.
Goodbye!
Take care!
Where's Surprise?
We don't want to lose her.
Boo!
I got ya! Ooh!
Surprise
frightened me!
Sorry, Baby Cuddles.
Knock off
the surprises,
Surprise.
We have to get
to Flutter Valley.
And we're already late
for the celebration...
I think.
Aren't we?
It's Cupcake's fault.
Took her forever to bake
that cake.
Perfection is not something
to be rushed, Gusty.
Me never been
to Flutter Valley.
You'll love it,
Baby Cuddles.
It's the most beautiful place
in all of Ponyland.
The most beautiful
place, indeed!
I hate Flutter Valley!
We hate it too, Mama--
I mean, Hydia.
And we hate
the Flutter Ponies too,
don't we, Hydia?
I want to ruin
the Flutter Ponies'
big deal celebration.
I want to make them pay
for stopping the Smooze.
Can't we get even
with the little ponies too?
They helped.
I have an idea,
Hydia--
whoa, oh-hh!
Let's ruin
the Flutter Ponies'
celebration.
I just said that,
you numbskull!
Now listen,
girls.
We're gonna
start by stopping
those little ponies
from getting
to that celebration.
Got it?
Got it.
Then do it!
How?
Yeah, how?
Ow!
You ask me how?
You're witches,
that's how!
We're going, Hydia.
We're leaving right now.
We're gone.
Bye!
Oh-hh, kids!
What is it with
them today?
They don't listen,
they don't think,
they have no idea
what they're doing.
Whoa!
See you later,
Hydia. Bye.
We'll get those ponies.
Don't worry.
Oh, what am I gonna do
with them?
There they are.
Yeah, let's get 'em.
And how, sister dear,
do you plan to do that?
Go down there
and grab them,
that's how.
Boy, you really
are dumb, Draggle.
There are too many
just to grab.
We've gotta be clever.
We've got to outsmart 'em.
You mean
we have to get help?
Follow me.
I have an idea.
Ugh!
Sorry, Reeka, dear.
It's gotta be
in here somewhere.
Here it is-- lasso.
I knew it.
Hold this.
"Cluerman, norkferm,
dand-evil, ferderkel"!
You did it!
Well, of course I did.
Get ready.
Here they come.
We should be getting close
to Flutter Valley.
Oh, I hope we don't
miss the celebration.
You're gonna miss
more than that!
Oh! Help!
It's the witches
from the Volcano of Gloom!
Run, Spike!
Get help!
Not so fast,
"dragon breath."
Oh, my little girls!
Look what they've done.
It's wonderful!
I'm so proud of them!
I'm so proud!
I wonder where
the little ponies are.
They're never late.
Oh, I hope
nothing bad happened.
What could happen?
It's a beautiful day,
the sun is shining,
life is wonderful!
Down there!
The witches have
the little ponies.
Switch to utter flutter.
Come on, little ponies.
Move it.
It's the Flutter Ponies!
I think we're in
big trouble.
This way.
Wha-what are we
going to tell Hydia?
Nothing.
She'll never know.
What if she's watching us
in the viewing pool?
Draggle,
get down here.
What if
she finds out
we failed?
We haven't failed.
Not yet.
We're going
to Flutter Valley.
Follow me!
Agh! Ow!
What are you
tryin' to do?
Hey, watch it!
Ow!
Ooh!
The sun is the lamp
that lights our valley.
It gives color to our
fields and flowers,
and spreads
beauty and love
with its warmth.
Ugh! That's
the worst thing
I ever heard, Ugh!
Yeah, who'd
want to live
where it's always
warm and beautiful?
Well, it won't be warm
and beautiful for long.
Let's see what we
can do about it.
Can I do it
this time, Reeka?
You always do it. Please?
Well, all right.
But you
better come up
with something good!
Here!
Uh-- ooh! Oh!
Thank you.
As Rosedust,
Queen of the Flutter Ponies,
I proclaim this day,
Sun Tuesday.
Let the celebration
begin!
and it's light,
Will you hurry up?
I can't find
anything.
Do something simple,
like a landslide.
We'll bury 'em.
Good idea!
"Land, Land grant...
Landlord... Land mine..."
I found it!
Then make it!
We made some woolie pies
for you, Rosedust.
We hope you like 'em.
Yeah, we really do.
Yeah,
please like 'em.
And we brought you
some bush melons too.
Yeah, bush melons.
Ooh, they're good.
I'm sure
we'll like them,
Bushwoolies.
Thank you very much.
And here's
a chocolate cake,
Rosedust.
Well, it was
a chocolate cake...
What is it?
Thunder? Drums?
Heavy dancing?
It's a landslide!
Landslide, landslide!
Run, my little ponies!
Fly away,
my little flutter ponies!
Hide, Bushwoolies,
hide!
The sun stone's
going to fall!
Oh, there must be
something we can do.
Better hurry!
Look! The baby Seaponies!
They've run out of water!
They will not long survive
out of their natural habitat.
I know Wind Whistler.
But where do we find water to
put them in?
There is a pond due south
about a mile.
Okay.
Ribbon, Whistler, Lofty,
Lickety-Split, Danny and Molly,
you get the baby Seaponies
to water.
The rest of you,
come with me to the Mushromp.
You think they'll be okay?
It's up to us to make sure.
Right.
Aa...how do we do that?
By getting to the Moochick
and finding a way
to make it rain.
Come on!
Oh boy! I sure hope
the Moochick is figuring out
a way to keep things cool.
Welcome! Welcome!
My, my, I thought it was too hot
for anyone to come visiting.
It's because of the heat
that we're here Mr. Moochick.
I guess!
I don't suppose
everyone can enjoy the comforts
of modern technology
like Habbit and I.
A magic coin like these
started the heat wave.
Aah...oh..yes, yes, yes, yes.
These look familiar now.
Where have I seen them before?
Ooh, let's see.
Yeah, ooh, oh, well,
it's around somewhere.
Now where did I put that thing?
Oh, it...where is the...
Oh, I know it's around here
somewhere,
I just saw it now.
Oh..mmm...oh
where it could be?
I have woken up...
I have just had it yesterday.
Now! There it is!
I knew I'll find it, ow!
There's a lot to be said
for a well-organized library.
Now, according to this,
the coins come from
the treasure collection of
Niblick the Troll,
who lives far away
in the dangerous Crimson Canyon
that's beyond the jewel desert.
Of course, mm-hm.
That's all very interesting,
Mr. Moochick.
But can you do anything
to reverse the effects
of the wish?
Ooh! No, no, no, no,
absolutely not.
I'm afraid, you see,
since the treasure
belongs to Niblick,
only he can reverse its magic.
Hmm...okay.
Then we'll just go talk
to this Niblick
and ask him to help us.
Ooh...I don't know.
Trolls are usually crotchety
and ill-mannered.
And Niblick's even crankier
than most.
We don't have any choice.
Come on again!
We're off the Crimson Canyon.
Thanks for your help,
Mr. Moochick.
No, you're quite
welcome, I am sure.
Habbit!
Had you seen the book
I was reading?
I don't know
where it got through.
Oh no!
Its dried up!
Whistler, you couldn't know
the water would dry up
this quickly.
Is there somewhere else
we can go?
We just have to find water
for the Seaponies.
It's even too hot to fly.
This weather is simply death
to my complexion.
We'll have to ration
what's left of the water.
Everybody gets one cupful.
Ow...oh.
That's okay Spike.
You can have some of mine.
Thank you, Galaxy.
If we do not find water soon
Wind Whistler,
we'll be as bad off
as the poor baby Seaponies.
We've come too far
to retreat now, Megan.
The only course is
straight ahead.
Uhh..how much further
is it Megan?
Ya...I'm thirsty.
Come on guys!
Cheer up!
Everything's gonna be all right.
Sure it is, I guess.
You know, a song might make us
feel better.
Don't you feel better now?
Ugh, singing made us
even more exhausted...ugh.
Water...must have water.
Galaxy, the cactus!
Use your horn on the cactus.
There might be water.
Hey, you're right!
Water!
Water!
Mm...it's too bad we can't
take any to the baby Seaponies.
There used to be water here.
Well, there isn't now.
We just have to keep looking.
And hope it isn't too late.
Megan,
I don't wanna scare anyone.
But I have the distinct feeling
we're being followed.
Let's get out of here, huh,
can we? huh, please!
Hiya...hiya...hiya,
Hoo..hoo...hoo
My name's Puck.
Who are you?
Uh...well, my name is Megan.
And my friends are--
So what are you doin' here?
Well, we're--
Let me guess.
You're trying to find
Niblick the Troll...right?
You must be!
He's the only one
who'd live around here.
Come on!
I'll take you to his house.
Well, uh...it--
It looks like we've got a guide.
If we can keep up with him.
This way, this way,
not far now.
I think
we're still being followed.
And now I'm sure of it.
Puck, get us out of here!
Right!
Just follow me!
Trust me.
Hoo..hoo...hoo.
I know these gullies
like the back of my hand.
Oops!
We're trapped!
Goodbye cruel world.
As much as I hate to say it,
we'll have to use
one of the coins.
Goblins are afraid of light.
I wish there was light!
Hey! It worked.
And the magic didn't backfire
on us this time.
Time to go, time to go.
Hoo..hoo...hoo.
Niblick's house
is not far from here.
Sorry about
getting lost last night.
But I know my way now.
Look!
There it is!
Nah! I say hello!
Hello there!
Aah, would you be so kind
as to lower the bridge?
Sure!
But you gotta give me
your crown.
Out of the question.
Now lower it I say.
I'm off to slay a dragon
and rescue a damsel.
Not unless you pay the toll.
Th-th-this is outrageous.
Wrong!
This is your living.
You don't like it,
grow a pair of wings.
No!...Er...Very well.
I agree.
That's more like it.
Oh!
The Moochick wasn't kidding.
That troll's bad news.
Aah, I shall report you
to my father, the king.
Aah! Put an egg in your sandal
and beat it.
Yo-hoo!
Um, Mr. Niblick!
Would you like to know
what happened to your
chest of magic coins?
Bring 'em on over,
and I'll give you discount
on the toll.
Hold it! hold it!
I don't see no coins.
What's the deal?
Well, uh...uh...that is we--
Well, we spent them.
It was an accident,
I'm sure you understand.
You spent my magic coins?
You spent my magic coins?
My coins! My coins!
Ohh-ho-ho!
We better think of
something quick.
And this is one hot
bath we won't enjoy!
I wish I was not suffering
from a singular lack
of inspiration.
Wishing! Of course, there're
still two coins left.
Oops!
Phew!
But which one will do the
trick without backfiring on us?
This is no time for
a equivocation.
Hit one quickly!
I wish we were as
light as a feather.
But only momentarily.
The wish worked!
Yeah! The wish worked!
This is fun.
Uh!
Bet Niblick's never seen a
treasure like this one.
Does it look like I
need another ruby?
Three tries is all you get.
But I'm not such a bad guy.
So I'm gonna let ya live.
On one condition!
Uhhh...what might that
be, Mr. Niblick?
GET OUTTA HERE! NOW!
Awww... Looks like we blew it.
I'll be happy to guide you
back to Ponyland, folks.
If that's where you're going.
Where else can we go?
I just hope the baby
Seaponies are okay.
It's all the water I can find.
Sorry!
Don't blame yourself, Shady.
There's no water anywhere.
Gotta be water some place.
I find some.
Baby Lofty, wait!
No water.
Oops!
No water, Molly.
That's okay, baby, you tried.
Something better happen soon.
I say look there!
I do believe it's a fire.
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind.
I'll check it out.
It is a fire...coming this way!
We've got to evacuate
the nursery.
Hiya! Where're we going?
Ah, it's fun!
Whee!
Get the baby Seaponies too!
The rest of us can start
digging firebreaks.
Looks bad, Ribbon.
You can't stop it.
We'll fight it as
long as we can.
But tell the others to get
ready to abandon Dream Valley.
Oh, no!
Come on!
We better not wait
any longer, Ribbon.
We gotta leave!
All right, let's--
Look! Over there!
It looks like Megan
and the others!
Maybe they found a
way to make it rain!
What're we gonna do?
Can't stop it.
There's only one chance, Megan.
Try the last coin.
Maybe you can
wish the fire out.
It's worth a try.
I wish the fire was out!
It isn't working!
It must be the wrong
coin for that wish!
Wind Whistler! Am I
ever glad to see you?
Climb on, hurry!
Thanks for saving my life.
I can hardly do
otherwise, Megan.
I would risk anything
for a friend.
For friendship after all is the
most important treasure
there is.
Friendship!
The clasped hands of course!
Now, I know what to do!
Megan! Is there any hope for us?
I think so,
if there's still time!
Keep fighting the fire.
Whistler, fly faster than
you've ever flown before!
You heard her,
let's do what we can!
Where we going, Megan?
Back to Niblick's house.
Mr. Niblick, Mr. Niblick!
You again?
You gotta lot of nerve showin'
your face around here.
Wait! I have a perfect treasure
for youe
and it'll come from
one of your own coins!
This better be good or else...
It will be!
I hope, I wish...
Run for it! Run! Help! Let's go!
Oh! What a pit--
Hey!
Who asked ya?
I might as well see
what the inside is like,
though I know
I am going to regret it.
Incredible!
What did you do?
Have a bunch of ogres
down for the weekend?
Well... Maybe I did let it go...
A little...
Oh! You can say that again.
Why not open a window?
Or Seven...
You!
This was your doing.
It-it seemed like a
good idea at that time.
A good idea?
It was a great idea!
It was?
Sure!
I didn't realize
how lonely I was.
And this place sure could use
someone who likes to clean!
I don't believe it.
What did you wish for, Megan?
Only the greatest treasure
of all, a friend.
This guy's worth more than all
the magic coins in Ponyland.
Name your price?
Undo the effects of the coins,
starting with the weather spell.
You got it!
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo
Shoo-bee-doo
shoop-shoop-bee-doo
It's so nice to have
everything back to normal.
You said it!
I got my old bubbles back!
And we got our water back!
I-uh...I don't know
how to thank ya.
I mean this guy maybe a pain
when it comes to
keeping things neat,
but he...well, I never had a...
I know what you're
trying to say, Niblick.
Friendship is a wish come true!
Look at that rainbow go.
Aha, just a couple more clouds
and we can start
picking the cherries
for cherries jubilee.
Yahoo,
nice job!
It sure was.
Okay, Rainbow of Light,
back where you belong.
Oh, come on, Megan! Cut loose!
Have some fun with this thing!
Danny!
What's wrong with a little rain?
I mean it makes things grow.
Maybe even little sisters.
Danny!
Portable weather.
Great idea, huh Megan?
Cut it out and act your age.
Hey, look, I'm sorry.
I'll put everything
back the way it was.
I was just foolin' around.
The Rainbow of Light is the most
powerful magic in the world.
We can only use it
once in a while
and only for special things.
Okay, okay, I got it.
Anyway, it's just as well.
The sun's out.
Get a load of this.
Say cheeseburger!
We can go up for a flight and do
aerial photography of Ponyland!
Terrific! Let's go!
Danny, you be careful.
We'll be fine!
Let's just go straight.
Sounds good to me.
That was straight?
Sure! But there's a
tail wind today.
Oh! This is so exciting.
It is! it is!
But just wait.
It's gonna get
even more exciting.
We're gonna be the most
famous gizmonks in the world!
Gock and Gluda the Great.
Inventors of the one and only
steam-powered, multi-tasking
double-ant whistle.
Tamers of the only
lesser crested snicklewhacker
in the world!
Inventors of gadgets and gizmos
and hyper super-duper
technical things.
Some of which we don't
even know what they are, yet.
Aha,
Oh, I'm impressed with us.
Wait!
Are you sure that's right?
Ah! Uh-ow!
Oooo oh oh! Ooo Ooo!
And soon, we'll have the
neatest gadget of all.
The Rainbow of Light.
Yeah.
But we'll have to get it first.
Hey,
did you see that?
Uh-huh!
And look!
Those two are with a girl
who had the rainbow.
Execute plan A.
That was the best landing
we've had, yet.
Yeah. Well, I still think
I'm going to make you
a saddle with seat belts.
Where did this come from?
I think maybe where
that thing came from?
Ah... Nice monster...
Is this the sort
of the adventure?
I'll get back to you on that.
What a mess!
All right strangers.
You are prisoners
and resistance is useless.
Give us that!
Why should I?
Oh...why shouldn't I?
Here.
Trash.
Garbage.
Useless!
Wait a minute! Not the walkman!
No! It's a computer! Don't!
But no luck.
So...
Time to send a message.
Drudge! Drudge!
Yes sir.
Yes ma'am.
You have to go to Dream Valley
and tell the girl
with the locket
that her brother
and his pony friend
are going to be held here
until they give us the locket
with the Rainbow of Light.
Yes, sir.
Yes, ma'am.
Whatever you say.
And in the meantime...
Wow!
Look at that!
It won't be long, now.
We gotta find a way
out of this place.
But how? We're sealed in
and locked up!
Listen!
Last one, Megan.
Thanks, Gusty!
It went fast with your help.
Megan!
There's someone
who's asked to see you.
It's something about Danny.
What is it?
The Great Gizmonks,
Gock and Gluda have sent me
to tell you that they have your
brother and the pony, Surprise
and will give them back to you
when you give them
the Rainbow of Light.
Go home and tell
the Great Gizmonks
that I'll get back to them.
Eh, fine!
But, Megan...
Wind Whistler,
quick, follow her!
And as soon as we know
where these gizmonks are
we'll figure out
how to rescue them.
Boy!
You guys have some really
awesome techno-stuff in here!
Yeah! Awesome!
My!
Very perceptive of you!
I really like that
sub-etheric discombobulator
you have over there.
Well, eh,
how nice.
And that whistle!
A ant whistle.
Yeah, it's radical.
Really terrific!
You think so?
Oh! we could really
learn a lot from you.
Ahh!
Drudge is back!
Whoa!
Hiya, Drudge!
Are you all right?
What about the girl?
She said she's thinking it over
and she'll get
right back to you.
Oh, all right.
Drudge! Let them out.
But don't you
touch anything.
Oh, no!
We won't touch anything.
All this must have taken
years to put together.
No, no, no, no, no,
you mustn't!
Oh, look at this
terrific experiment!
Oh, look out!
You're doing this
in purpose.
We sure are.
We're gonna blow this joint.
Please take me with you.
The creature went in there,
Megan.
We're never going to
break into that place.
And what are those
strange noises?
Let's go down there.
Hey! Can you tell me
what this is over here?
Well, certainly.
(multiple overlaying
strange noises)
All right!
Thanks very much!
And that was all
I wanted to know!
Oh! No!
No rainbow is worth this!
Look!
Are they attacking us?
I don't think so!
Take them home!
Take them home!
My goodness!
Oh! No!
Hi, Megan!
What have you two been up to?
Being irresponsible.
In a responsible way!
Hey, Drudge, you okay?
Yes, thanks to you two.
You've set us free
from the gizmonks.
And after we rebuild this place,
we'll start making some
really useful things.
We'll help you anyway we can.
Well if Gluda and Gock
come back,
just lend us these
two heroes again.
Huh-oh, it was nothing.
We would've
done it for anybody.
Well, let's get home
before we miss
all that cherries jubilee.
Yum! I forgot.
Right. Heroes first.
And now!
Gingerbread and Shady
will compete in
the earth pony jumping finals.
Oh!
Yaay!
HELP! HELP! HELP!
HELP!
No one helps dragons!
Oh no, well,
you're absolutely wrong.
We do and this is how we do it!
Oh, uggh!
Yeah, Whizzer.
Hey!
Who blew out the candles?
Stand still beast.
Meet your fate like a man!
But I'm not a man!
I'm a dragon!
Whooaaoohh!
Hang in there, Spike!
You've caused enough trouble
with that.
Now, who are you
and why are you trying
to hurt our friend?
I am Squire Alonso
and this is my
faithful steed, Panza
And I wasn't trying
to hurt your dragon.
I was trying to slay him,
to do a good deed.
How is getting rid of me
a good deed, huh?
Tell me, huh, huh!
Everyone knows dragons are evil.
That's not true!
Spike s a real friend!
Spike s a nice little dragon!
I think, we're in trouble again.
But I read all about dragons.
They always catch princesses
and hold them in dungeons.
Not this dragon.
He's my friend!
I'm sorry, Spike.
Please forgive me.
It's just that
I must do a good deed
to become a knight.
But everything
I try turns out wrong.
I say,
let's help this guy.
He sure needs it.
Something tells me we can find
a good deed for you to do.
You think so?
Hmpf!
Here we go again.
I know you'll do a good deed
with just a little help.
So we're gonna help him,
huh, huh?
Yeah, let's help him!
I'm willing.
Let's do it!
Aww, whose idea was this, huh?
We've been walking,
and walking, and walking.
Spike,
we're helping
a would-be knight
to do a good deed!
We're helping a
would-be dragonslayer.
Megan, listen.
And look!
A castle!
But why is there a wall
of briars around it?
Must be like a moat.
To keep people out.
That voice.
It's so beautiful.
It must belong to a princess.
Maybe she's trapped
inside...in trouble.
We've got to rescue her.
Right now!
Briar wall?
It's so big!
I can light the
way with my horn.
Great!
Then let's go!
Finally!
The outer wall.
Good work, Alonso.
Hello! You in there,
in the castle.
I, Squire Alonso,
am here to rescue you.
Over here.
I found a door.
Come on.
Oops!
It's Sir Huguenot
The bravest knight of all time.
His lady Princess Aileen.
And Emelita, Aileen's
fairy godmother.
So, who need rescuing?
No one needs rescuing.
Who are you?
Why have you intruded
on the wedding feast
of my godchild
and her groom?
Wedding feast?
Oh, no!
We thought the briars were there
to keep the princess a prisoner.
I conjured up the briar ring
to keep her out of trouble.
This hero, Aileen's wed,
attracts misadventure,
the way an old bone
attracts dogs!
Not anymore
my dear Emelita.
I've retired.
You mean, you've
given up your quests?
Quests are for younger men.
I ask Moffat here,
the wizard at court,
to find a replacement
to serve my king.
A replacement?
I'd do anything.
Well, gee Alonso,
Maybe we should leave.
An excellent idea.
Music - play.
Uh, so sorry
for the intrusion.
Good night.
I was so dumb.
And in front of the wizard.
Oh, cheer up, Alonso.
We could still find
a good deed for you to do.
Sure.
In eighty years or so,
when I'm too old
to lift a sword...
Maybe we should all go back
to Paradise Estate and rest up.
Yes. Let's go back and
everybody can take a rest.
I guess, I just don't have
what it takes to be a knight.
Hey! What are you
throwin' at me?
Huh?
It's bad enough that
I'm stuck on my back.
Now, you're gonna
throw things at me?
Well, are you gonna
help me turn over?
Oh, yeah!
Sure.
Let me...
Come on. That's it. Good try.
Hey, what's the matter?
You're so heavy!
Great. Now, you make
cracks about my weight.
Alonso, I hope you're not
thinking of this as giving up
Hey, Alonso.
She is been nice to you.
Why don't you talk to her?
You know,
you've gotta be nice and...
Alonso is missing!
We'd better go look for him!
I have a feeling
he's in trouble.
Come on!
I knew it...
The simplest little
thing I can't do right.
Great. I'm stuck
and the only guy
who can do me
a good deed is a quitter.
I'm not a quitter!
I just don't have any way
to turn you over.
Huh!
Wait a minute!
Call me a quitter, huh?
What are ya gonna do?
This is the place
where we saw him last.
Oh, what'll I do
without him around?
He's such a nice guy.
One, two, three, and ugghhhh!
Congratulations!
You've just passed
the top-up-turtle test!
I did? I have?
Yes!
I was looking for
a replacement for Sir Huguenot,
and I decided to give you
a little test.
Now, I know
I've found that replacement
I was looking for - You!
Me?
Yes, my boy.
Not everyone would have kept
going when things were that bad.
I need a knight
who won't give up.
A true knight! A knight with
a stout heart.
You got him!
And I'm taking him with me.
Well, I can't leave
without thanking you first.
If not for you, I might have
given up a long time ago.
You had it in you all the time.
Bye, bye.
And remember...
Be nice to dragons.
I will, Spike.
And I'll remember
all of you, too.
Always!
Good bye.
Good bye, bye, bye...
Bye, bye...
You know.
For a would-be dragonslayer,
he wasn't that bad.
Spike!
Look out, Twilight.
Here I go!
Now it's my turn!
I could have made it.
I wish,
I wish, I wish!
I'm going for the
double inside-out loop!
But it's dangerous, Firefly.
Danger is my life, Medley!
Firefly! Look out!
Apple sauce, anyone?
Twilight,
will I ever fly like
Firefly and Medley?
No, Ember.
Not all little ponies can fly.
Will I jump far like Bow Tie?
Or disappear like you can?
Ember, you'll grow up to
be your own special little pony.
Everybody, quick! Come on.
Oh no! No way...
Oh no...
Ahh..
What's going on?
It's the Stratadons!
Stratadons?
Run!
Help! Help!
Seize them!
Whoaaaaaah, help!
You are all doomed.
Soon every pony
will belong to Tirrac,
the master of Midnight Castle.
Help! Aah!
Firefly,
no! Wait!
Where are you going?
To get help!
No, come back!
It's too dangerous!
Firefly, come back!
Come back!
Listen, Scorpan,
can I go with you next time?
Huh?
Can I? Can I?
No, Spike.
I can slither really fast,
Scorpan, really fast.
Not now, Spike, not now.
Aww...
Quiet, my friend.
Your time will come.
We have captured two
of the little ponies, Master.
Have you forgotten something,
Scorpan?
Yes, that is better.
Two ponies, you say?
Only two?
Yes, Master.
But I need four ponies
for my chariot.
Not two, not three, four.
Yeah, Yeah,
but he tried to get them,
Master Honest
I mean honestly,
he really
and truly tried and...
Silence!
You will prepare another raid,
Scorpan...NOW!
As you wish...Master.
That is precisely what I wish.
Look, TJ a shooting star!
Whoah! Whoooooah!
Whooooooaaaaaaaaaah!
Whatever it is,
it sure is heavy!
Hello.
Talking pony?!
Ugh. I can fly too.
At least I could before
my wings got soaked!
Sorry.
What...who are you?
My name's Firefly.
What's yours?
Megan, and...and that's
my pony, TJ.
Hey! Firefly,
where are you going?
Slow down.
Yep, Yep, Yep,
looks high enough...
High enough...
high enough for what?
Hop on.
Uh...you do know how to ride,
I hope?
Of Course I know how to ride.
Great!
Hey! Where are we going?
To help my friends,
they need you.
Me? What can I do?
You're strong.
No, I'm not.
You can fight.
No, I can't.
And you can fly.
I said I could ride...not fly!
Oh, my friends are just
gonna love you!
No, they won't!
Ponyfeathers.
Why can't you believe?
You're gonna be great.
But Firefly...
Trust me!
Firefly! Firefly! You're okay.
This is Megan, everybody.
She's here to help us!
Hooray!
Run, everybody!
Run!
Help!
Somebody do somethin'.
Agh! The double-inside-out loop.
It's the only way.
Help!
MEGAN!
Leave this land.
This battle is not yours.
What are you doing?
You...you...you beast!
You're a monster.
Do you hear me?
A monster!
See? Whoo, you are brave.
Am not, he just got me mad,
that's all.
Now come on.
We'll save our friends...
somehow.
Help me! Help me! Help me!
No, please!
Help!
Let us go.
Silence!
That's better.
Guards, remove the small one.
Oh...You won't hurt Ember?
She is too small to pull
my Chariot of Midnight
as you should have known,
Scorpan.
Ow!
But you three will do...for now.
Behold the Power of Darkness!
What's happened to my friends?
They belong to me now.
And, Scorpan, if by midnight
I do not have a fourth pony,
a head will roll...HIS!
The Moochick has magic powers.
He'll help us.
He lives in the Mushromp,
over there.
This bridge doesn't feel
very safe.
Come on, it's fine!
Whooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
APPLEJACK!
I'll save her.
Honeysuckle,
are you okay?
Oh, she's gone.
Gone, but not forgotten.
She'll always be remembered
as the Flutter Pony
who tried to dump me,
but got dumped herself!
Oh my,
I'm so poetic sometimes.
All right, back to work,
Flutter Ponies.
We'll get a new claw
and fix the crane.
But we've got to get that
Sunstone out of the hole.
I'll talk to Bumble.
No, Megan.
Talking won't work.
The Furbob's right.
I am?
Bumble's too mean
to listen to reason.
But we have to
try to find the good in people.
That's right.
I have to try.
Wait for me.
I'm coming with you!
Morning Glory.
Megan.
Grab her!
Wait, I've come to talk.
Talk?
Who are you?
What are you?
I'm Megan,
a friend of the Flutter Ponies.
I'm asking you to let them go
and give them back
their Sunstone.
Surely you jest,
yes?
No, as a matter of fact,
you're surrounded!
Do as I ask,
and no harm will come to you.
Agh!
Megan!
Help!
Let's go.
Yikes!
Come on, Flutter Ponies.
Let's fly.
We can't. There's still honey
on our wings.
But we can try to run again.
Swarm them!
Don't let them get away!
I'll save you, Megan.
Grab hold!
Gotchya.
Whoaaaaa!
Ugh, thanks Furbob.
Oh...
I've got you now, Sting.
Ouch!
Sting, are you okay?
I think so...
Can...can you pull
this stinger out?
Thanks, Morning Glory.
I owe ya.
To the victor
goes the Sunstone.
Aww, cheer up, Draggle.
Not being able to do magic
isn't the end of the world.
It is if you're a witch.
Especially if Hydia's
your mother.
Why don't you let us go?
Yeah. That'll show Hydia
she shouldn't make fun of you.
Oh no, I couldn't do that.
She'd never forgive me.
She'd kick me out of the
Volcano of Gloom for good.
What's wrong with that?
We have an idea, Draggle.
We'll teach you some pony magic.
You will?
Sure! Then you can make
Hydia proud of you.
She'll think
you're the greatest.
What do I have to do?
Just watch and listen.
You might want to take notes.
I'm ready.
Great, let me just...
Gee, what a shame.
Bye, Draggle. See ya!
You tricked me,
you miserable little ponies.
Wait 'till I get out of here!
I'll get you.
It's almost sunset.
There's not much time
to find the Sunstone!
Or the Flutter Ponies.
We've got to
get to Bumbleland now!
I think it's that way.
Hop on, Spike.
I'll give you a ride!
Through there.
Hey, it's only a painting.
It's sticking to us.
It's fly paper.
It's a trap!
That's a taste of real magic,
little ponies.
Take 'em away, Ahg!
Rooaaagghhhrr.
What you gonna do to Draggle?
Something bad, I hope.
Really punish her.
Is that any way to
talk about your sister?
Well, I, Uh...
I just thought that...
Shut up!
Let's go watch
Flutter Valley rot.
It's almost sunset.
Flutter Valley's going to
shrivel up to nothing...
I'm sorry, Morning Glory.
I wasn't much help.
Don't give up.
Remember, it's never over
'till the fat lady stings!
That really makes me feel
a lot better, Sting.
Another one!
Sorry, your Bumbleness.
There are no more.
No more?
No more beautiful
nectar-filled flowers?
We cleaned out the forest.
There aren't any more
for miles!
But if we had the Sunstone,
it would attract the sun,
and the flowers would grow
and I'd have my nectar.
Right?
But we can't reach the
Sunstone, your Bumbleness.
Psst...
Honeysuckle!
Shh.
Get the Flutter Ponies and
go down the hole.
Don't worry, it's safe.
What about Bumble and her bees?
They've got a surprise coming.
You ready?
Now, Stonebacks, NOW!
The Stonebacks?
To the hole, Flutter Ponies.
Hurry!
Honeysuckle!
But we thought you were...
What happened?
Later, Rosedust.
Just get everybody
down the hole.
Follow me, Flutter Ponies.
Hi, Honeysuckle.
Hi, Peach Blossom.
Hi, Honeysuckle.
Hi, Forget-Me-Not.
What's going on here?
Whoaaaah!
Your Bumbleness!
Whoooooaaah!
That's enough, Stonebacks.
Retreat!
Where's the Furbob?
I thought he was with you.
I'll get him.
You're next, Sting.
Sting?
Come on, Furbob.
We have to go!
I...I can't.
I'm afraid of the Stonebacks.
They'll hurt me.
No, they won't.
They're helping us.
It must be a trick.
They're our mortal enemies.
Nothing will happen to you,
I promise.
Please, Furbob. Come on.
Move out!
Hurry!
Go on, Furbob.
You first.
Okay!
Get 'em!
Just a little higher, Surprise.
Okay, Megan.
Perfect.
Oh boy, the Pony Olympics
are gonna be so exciting!
Come on,
you can do it.
Jump higher.
That's it.
You've got to practice
if you're going to be
in shape for the games.
See, you can actually do
three in a row
if you pull up pretty fast.
Well,
you can try it if you like.
Okay,
let's run through it again.
Okay, Shady,
whenever you're ready.
Oof!
Try again, Shady.
And this time, the rest of you
follow after her.
Agh!
Ow!
Hey, what's that?
It sure is pretty.
Hmm...
Let's check it out.
Come on.
Ouch!
Who turned out the lights?
Huh!
Let's...let's--
Calling Porcina.
Calling Porcina.
Come in,
Porcina.
Oh, la de da de dae.
I'm so gorgeous...
Today!
Is this what you want?
Shrock!
Why are you interrupting me
when I have important things
to do around here?
Agh, showing me
pictures of goons
dancing around
in funny clothes.
Forgive me, your ladyness.
But I thought you might
like this material
that the boys
are modeling for you.
No, no, no!
That's not it at all!
That's just ordinary laundry.
I need some magical material
to repair my beloved cloak.
It's becoming faded
and tattered.
Without new magic, I won't be
able to turn things into glass.
Kazim, kazam,
kazoom!
See, my magic is running low,
and without glass how will I be
able to admire my rare beauty?
You must find a solution!
Hey, how long are we going to
put up with this prima donna?
This spoiled princess?
Just until she creates
a new kingdom for us.
And no one else!
Right!
He loves me, he loves me not.
He loves me, he loves me not.
He loves me!
Hi, Shady.
What's the matter, Shady?
I can't fly like a Pegasus,
I don't have any magical powers
like Gusty and Galaxy,
and I can't even make it
through a simple jumping drill
like any self respecting
Earth Pony.
I'll bet everybody thinks
I'm useless,
and they're probably mad at me
for messing things up.
Oh no, Shady.
I'm sure they're not.
But the best way to find out
is to ask them.
Yeah?
Why not?
Oh, hey!
Watch it!
Careful!
Ow!
Oof! Ow!
Ouch! Ow!
Look at that.
Those are little ponies.
Did you see that?
Look, boss.
They're magic.
I think this is a jackpot.
Shrock, how dare you
interrupt me
with this image
of a bunch of ponies?
Wait a minute.
Oh, most fair mistress.
It is our belief that
the hair of these here ponies
possess magical properties.
Would that hair not make
a most delightful
replacement cloak
for your loveliness
if woven into a fabric?
Oh yes!
I must have that hair!
Return at once, for we must
prepare a plan for obtaining it.
Soon, my little cutie,
everywhere we look
we'll see me.
ME!
Oh, let's see
where did I put that?
I know it's here somewhere.
Though there won't be much
to look at when we're through.
Gusty and Galaxy each have
their special talents,
Lickety Split is
a terrific jumper,
and you can fly, Heartthrob.
What can I do
that is of any use to anyone?
I know just how you feel.
Sometimes it seems as though
everything is going wrong.
Like, just the other day,
I wanted some triple fudge
nut caramel ice cream
and all we had was vanilla.
Hmm... This is delicious.
Do you want some?
No, that's not what I...
Practice makes perfect.
You simply just got to
set your mind to it, Shady.
I have been practicing.
I try.
Maybe you're trying too hard.
Maybe you need to
have a little fun,
have some excitement.
Like a lovely costume party.
Something glamorous!
What do you think of
my new dress?
Now be honest.
You don't understand.
I want to be useful.
I want to do
something important.
Oh, you're so serious.
You just need a little sunshine
in your life!
Oh, never mind.
Shady, wait.
Don't go away mad.
You can't give up, Shady.
Hey,
what happened to Shady?
I don't know.
She was here a minute ago.
Boy,
how's that for gratitude?
Come on!
Blow!
Help!
Whoah!
Where are you taking us?
And why?
"And so, the giant chased
after the little grundle.
"And as he chased
he went boom, boom, boom!
"The grundle ran fast,
but the giant took giant steps.
"Boom, boom, boom!
"Coming closer and closer
and closer,
"boom, boom, boom!
The tiny grundle"
Oh, hello, Cherries Jubilee.
What's the story?
Oh, it's about
the giant that goes, boom!
I thought you're gonna
be fixing things up.
See? Everything needs work.
Not everything.
Ouch!
Oh, my.
Yes, everything.
Okay.
Baby Cuddles, why don't you run
along for your nap?
Paradise and I will get to work.
Don't you dare.
Gosh, Paradise, I'm sorry.
It's not you, Sweet Stuff.
It's Paradise Estate.
It's simply...falling apart.
Even our tools are a mess.
But we promised
we'd fix up the Estate,
And I just couldn't face
the other ponies if we failed.
Come help me oil this shade.
Oh, dear!
I don't understand it.
It's never
this hard in fairytales.
I heard a story
once about a wizard
who cleaned up a whole kingdom
just by snapping his fingers.
I wish it were as easy for us.
There. Solid as a rock slide...!
Ah!
Whoa!
I have had it!
Come on, Sweet Stuff.
Where are we going?
To get some decent tools.
I'm glad we did this.
We needed a break, Sweet Stuff.
House work is so--so boring.
Why can't life be more like
a storybook anyway?
A good question indeed!
But chores need not be dreary,
if you have the right equipment.
Why he's got just
what we've been looking for!
Yes, but we need some nails
and a new broom and--
Oh, I could sell
you all those things,
but this can of magic paint
is all you really need.
Paint?
You're kidding, right?
It will solve
all your household problems.
I guarantee anything
this paint touches will be
transformed into something new
and wonderful.
You may even have this
can as a free sample.
All right, we'll take it.
But Paradise--
Haven't you ever heard
the one about,
never look a gift pony
in the mouth?
Thank you.
Magic paint?
When Paradise?
When are you going to stop
believing such crazy stories?
Well, it can't hurt
to try it out.
You've got to admit,
it looks a little better.
What do you know? It is magic.
Well, come on.
The magic paint!
It brought everything to life.
Well, don't just stand there
with your mouths a'gapin'.
Say something!
Uh, hi!
Uh, aren't you the sofa
I was s'posed ta fixed.
Well, the very same!
Only I fix myself.
Good as new, don't ya know?
Can I help? Can I help?
Huh?
Can I? Can I?
Oh, uh, certainly.
Don't step on the begonias!
Uh-oh...
I need more water.
I'll get it.
Fill 'er up, buddy!
That tickles!
You're my favorite baby buggy.
You're my bestest friend ever.
And I always
will be Baby Cuddles.
Oh! I love you.
Hey, turn me down already.
I am boiling over!
Okay, okay, don't have a fit.
Hey, hurry it up already!
You think I wanna be stuck
in this goop all day?
Oh!
Come on, Cherries Jubilee,
you can do it.
Just ten more reps, that's it.
Come on.
Go, Jubilee, go!
Hey, lighten up, huh?
Hey! Wipe yer' feet!
I was just polished.
Well, excuse me!
I've wanted to give
these wretched ponies
a piece of my mind
for some time now.
What's going on, Paradise?
The whole place
is getting so pushy.
Oh, yeah. Come on. Watch it!
Watch it.
Don't trample the petunias.
Sorry...
I-I'll be more careful...
Lay off.
The roses
don't need much water.
Okay, okay.
This nag doesn't know
what to do.
She only gets in the way.
I say get rid of her.
I'll--I'll--I'll do better.
I promise.
Scram!
Beat it! Yes! That way!
My garden...
Hey! Snap it up,
little slowpoke! C'Mon! Hurry!
I'm gonna have a
nervous breakdown.
Oh!
Back to work!
Cupcake!
Over here.
Am I glad to see you!
Harder! C'mon! Harder!
Sweep me!
Polish me!
Dust me!
Harder, faster!
Oh, I can't take it anymore.
You can't quit now.
You've still got 20 sets to go!
Oh, oh!
I can't take it!
And where do you think
you're goin'?
Let me out!
Cherries Jubilee... Run for it!
You ponies can't
keep nothing neat.
Why, we do a better job
ourselves, don't ya know?
Go, shoo!
What's going on?
Baby Cuddles!
Paradise, what's the matter?
We've got to get out of here.
No! Don't wanna leave my buggy.
Baby Cuddles, don't leave me.
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Is that everyone?
Almost.
You clods,
You're crushin' my fibers.
Ah! Oof!
Stay out!
But that's our home.
Not anymore, Sweet Stuff.
Ooh, don't-don't you think
that's enough, Bumble?
You don't want to
drown them?
I don't.
Oh well, of course I don't.
I just want
to GROUND them.
That's enough.
How about if I get
you some more nectar,
your...your...your...
Bumbleness?
Ugh, I'm afraid we're stuck,
Flutter Ponies.
I can hardly move.
I can!
Oh, I'm trying, Honeysuckle.
There's a tiny opening...If...
if I can only get up there,
maybe I can escape.
You can do it, Morning Glory.
Just a little more.
One more step to freedom.
Hey, you can't do that!
Oh no!
Buzz...ooh!
Hey, Stonebacks!
Up here.
Bet you can't catch me.
Na na na na na...
It's not working, Surprise.
I'd make a bubble,
but what good would it do?
What's Gusty doing?
Trying to blow them away.
It's not working.
Oh, they're too, too heavy.
I...I can't do it.
Wish them away, Wishful.
Oh, I wish I could.
Try it, yeah.
At least try.
I wish...I wish
the Stonebacks would go away.
Some wish.
Yeah,
we could do that.
Get ready to run.
I have an idea.
Run, everyone!
In here, Furbobs.
Hurry!
I knew we lived this way.
Welcome to Furbobia!
Ooh, it's beautiful!
And these are
the rest of the Furbobs...
Hi!
Hello!
Goodbye.
Glad to see you.
No, we're not.
What's up?
We need your help.
Baby Cuddles hurt her leg.
Prepare the steamer!
The steamer?
Me not want to get steamed.
I...I'm getting tired.
My wings are heavy
from the honey.
I'll never make it
to the little ponies.
I don't suhelp? you could
Well,
thanks anyway.
Flutter Pony!
Get her!
Oh dear!
Oh... Oh no!
My wings won't work.
Oh... It's hard to be a hero...
Back to Bumbleland!
No! Help!
Ugh,
I drank so much nectar,
I'm going to explode.
I told you to take it easy,
your Bumbleness.
Too much of a good thing
makes it bad.
Spare me the wisdom of your
philosophy, Sting,
and remove my slippers.
Ahh...that's better.
The escapee.
Well done, Pointer.
You may go now.
And just where did you think
you were going? Hmm?
Please don't hurt me.
I won't try to escape again.
I don't think you will either.
Sting,
place this sticky little
Flutter Pony in the cage.
And this time,
YOU guard her!
Oh, do I have to...
Do you wish to continue
being my right hand bee?
Well, to tell you the truth...
Just do it!
Oh, let's go. Let's go!
It's just you and me now.
Move it out!
Ooh!
Is it getting warm in here,
or is it just me?
I'm so sleepy...
I scared, Spike.
Aww, don't worry.
I'm here.
I won't let anything
bad happen to you.
Are you sure
this is gonna work?
As sure as I'm a Furbob.
We do it all the time.
Besides, they are our cousins.
They wouldn't do anything bad.
No, never, uhuh.
Nothing bad.
Baby Cuddles will be
as good as new.
What's that?
Shh...
They're starting.
It worked!
Me all better.
Thanks for your help, Furbobs.
But I'm afraid we have to
leave now
and get back
to Paradise Estate.
Before you go,
do you think you could
help us with the Stonebacks?
Yeah, they destroy
every place we live.
They haven't found this one.
They will.
You helped us, Furbobs,
so we'll help you.
Let's get them!
Wait, Gusty!
There are too many Stonebacks.
Why don't we ask
the Flutter Ponies
to help us help the Furbobs?
Because we can do
it ourselves, that's why.
Fizzy's right.
We'll go back to Flutter
and get the Flutter Ponies.
It's too dangerous alone.
Hi.
Spike?
I thought you were staying
behind with the others.
Us dragons are brave and tough.
I thought you might need me.
Aaaah, what was that!
Oof!
What happened
to brave and tough?
Well, I'm pretty sure
we're tough.
Come on!
The way out of the orchard's
this way. I think...
Soon, my little girls,
Flutter Valley will be
wilted and ugly,
and we'll have a
new place to live.
Ow!
I'm not so sure I want to
the Volcano of Gloom, Hydia.
Me either.
It's hard to start over
in a new neighborhood.
You'll do
what I tell you to do!
Besides,
I've always wanted an
ugly old place in the country.
Some acreage,
a dried up stream...
The perfect setting to
raise a family.
I'm going to win, girls!
It's my turn.
My turn.
Oh, I won, I won!
Rooaaaaggghhhr!
How much longer till
Flutter Valley turns rotten?
Just as soon as the sun sets.
Then it's goodbye sun,
goodbye Flutter Valley!
Help! Somebody, help!
Help us!
Oh,
it's getting so hot up here!
Hey,
watch where you're dripping,
Forget-Me-Not.
Maybe if
the honey melts enough,
we'll be able to move again
and get out of here.
You're right, Rosedust.
It's working.
Yeah, I can move
my wings again.
I can almost fly.
If only I could
get out of here,
I could help the other
Flutter Ponies.
Oh, it's all Sting's fault.
I thought he was my friend.
I am your friend.
Sting!
But I thought you left
to join Bumble?
I did, but I couldn't find her.
You mean she
flew away without you?
Guess so.
Guess she isn't
really my friend.
Well,
we could still be friends.
I'd like that, Morning Glory.
Let's see if we can save
the rest of the Flutter Ponies.
We have to move the Sunstone.
No sweat.
I'll take care of that.
What are you gonna do?
Mission accomplished.
But the Sunstone is gone.
So what? The fire's out.
So what?!
It's a calamity!
Without the Sunstone,
Flutter Valley will be no more.
It's finished.
Oh, well that's
a definite problem.
Keep trying, Flutter Ponies.
We almost made it.
Try harder.
There must be something
we can do to help.
You'd better help yourself
first, Morning Glory.
Grab her, Sting!
No, Bumble.
Morning Glory is my friend.
Don't be ridiculous.
The Flutter Ponies
are not our friends.
They're my friends, Bumble.
You realize of course, Sting,
that your attitude borders
on betrayal.
Well, what you've done
isn't so nice either.
Let the Flutter Ponies go
and I'll apologize.
Never.
They're mine.
Pointer, take Sting
and Morning Glory prisoner.
Got you, your Bumbleness.
Get them!
Duck!
Agh!
To the air!
Hey, Sting's flying.
He can't do that.
After them!
Oh my...
I am beautiful!
I've been waiting
for this chance, Sting.
Well, you've got it, Pointer.
Way to go, Sting.
Whoah!
Let's get out of here.
Sorry, your Bumbleness.
We made it.
We're free.
The Flutter Ponies
have escaped.
There's too much honey
on my wings.
I can't fly.
Then run, Flutter Ponies, run.
Oh, if only we could fly again.
We never were great runners.
I want that Sunstone back,
Flutter Ponies,
and you're going to help me.
The Sunstone's ours, Bumble.
We need it to bring
Flutter Valley back to life.
Oh, come on, come on, come on!
Hydia hates me,
she hates me not.
She hates me, she hates me not.
she hates me...
Oh!
Hydia hates me,
she hates me not.
Ouch!
How much longer until
Flutter Valley rots, Hydia?
Soon.
When the sun sets,
Flutter Valley will be dark,
dank and dreary - for good.
Just the way we like it.
Oh, we're running out of time,
little ponies.
If we don't get the Sunstone
back here soon,
we can kiss
Flutter Valley goodbye.
If only one of us could
just escape and get some help.
But how do we get past Ahhg?
Roooaaaahhhhggggrrr!
I have an idea.
Oh no, you won't.
I won't do it.
Nope, uh-uh.
Nope, uh-uh.
Please, Furbob. You have to,
it's our only chance.
Yours too.
Okay.
But this better work.
Close your eyes, Furbob.
I don't want to get
any bubble in them.
It's working!
Go, Fizzy! Way to go!
You can open your eyes now,
Furbob.
Hey, this is fun.
Hey Ahhg,
bet you don't have
many friends, do you?
Rooooaaaaggghhhr!
Want to play with our friend?
Roooaaagghhhr!
All you have to do is
let him out,
and he'll play with you.
Whoah!
It worked.
Run, Furbob.
Get help.
Run for it.
Roooooaaaaggghhhr!
Oh, you let them escape,
you buzzoff! Oof!
Rooaaaaggghhr!
Whoah ho ho hooo!
Don't be upset, Hydia.
It's okay.
Yeah, what can
one skinny old furbob do?
You'll see, witches.
You'll see.
I don't know if
I did the right thing.
By leaving Bumbleland?
All I ever wanted
was for Bumble to like me.
I like you.
Thanks, Morning Glory.
But there's only two of us.
How can we possibly save
the rest of the Flutter Ponies
and the Sunstone too?
Look, a rainbow!
What good is a rainbow?
It's just pretty, that's all.
Megan lives on the other side.
I remember the little ponies
telling us that.
Who's Megan?
She always helps
the little ponies
when they're in trouble.
Maybe she'll help us.
Let's go!
Do you know how to get there?
No...
But it can't be that difficult.
We have to try.
This is where Megan lives?
It looks like the place
the little ponies told us about.
Let's see if we can find her.
I've never seen a Megan before.
What would she look like?
Well, she's kind of big,
and...and has long hair -
only on her head,
and... Oh... Well,
you'll know her when
you see her.
Megan!
Are you here, Megan?
Not here.
What if she's gone
on a trip or something?
Oh, she just has to be here.
We need her.
Uh-oh...
Is that Megan?
Run!
In there!
Over the rainbow is not such
a safe place to live either.
If only Megan were here.
Oh no!
MEGAN!
Well, here's another fine mess
we've gotten ourselves into.
It's my fault.
I trusted Drog
and he led us into a trap.
It was a risk
worth taking, Danny.
Don't worry.
We're not beaten yet.
But midnight is not
far off, Megan.
And when it strikes,
we shall all be banished
to the Realm of Darkness.
I can't help,
but feel that the big bell
we found is important.
It has something to do
with Grogar's power.
I'm certain of it.
In you go, traitor.
He called you a traitor.
That means you didn't betray us.
A few Troggles
are still loyal to Grogar.
They told him
of my plan to help you.
Well, that wasn't very nice.
But most of my people
are fed up with Grogar.
They would help you
against him,
if you would give us
a new home in Ponyland.
You bet we would.
Oh, yes. We would. Why not?
But how can we get word
to the rest of the Troggles.
We can't escape this dungeon.
Good news, master.
The Moochick and the baby ponies
have been captured.
That means Ponyland is mine.
This calls for a celebration.
Tell the Troggles that anyone
not found celebrating
will be banished along with
the ponies at midnight.
Er...rh...right away, master.
Now, start the spell
that will banish the ponies
from Ponyland forever.
Wonder what
they're so happy about?
They're not.
They're just following
Grogar's orders.
That's funny.
It sounds louder over here.
And it gets louder
the higher I go.
It's loudest at this crack.
And there's fresh air
coming through.
If there were some way
to widen the crack,
something
we could force into it.
Barf!
Try this.
I'd rather pour it
in a crack than eat it.
If we could put the gruel into
the crack and make it bubble,
it would expand
and make the crack bigger.
I've got it!
Forget-Me-Not,
you and Peach Blossom,
carry the bucket
up to the crack.
Okay.
Now Buttons,
you move the soup
from the bucket into the crack.
I'll try.
But everybody get out
from underneath, just in case.
Hurry,
We can't hold it much longer.
Look out! Below!
Phew!
Fizzy, you've got to make
that stuff in the crack bubble.
Okay.
Hey, it's working.
Look out!
I'd say, good show.
Forget-Me-Not, come with us.
We'll find a way
to get the door open.
Hurry! We've got to find Bray
and get those keys from him.
Look, there's Bray!
Not so fast, Bray.
What?
Hey stop!
Hey, hey...
What are you doing?
Get away from me!
I'll take those.
Stop! Come back!
No!
Grogar's gonna be mad
when he hears about this.
Hee-haw!
Let's go everybody.
It's almost midnight.
Escaped!
You fool!
It wasn't my fault.
If they get out of the city,
you will take their place.
The ponies are free.
Now it's time
to set ourselves free.
Help us against Grogar,
and you'll be free!
What do we do now?
We've got to reach
the gates before midnight.
Come on!
It's Grogar!
Boy, if it isn't one thing,
it's another.
I say! It looks like
we're trapped.
Somebody think of something.
I'm trying, but nothing
rings any bells!
Ring the bell!
That's it!
Excuse me, what was that?
The bell we found
in the hidden room.
Legend says
that when it's rung,
Grogar's power
will be destroyed.
It's our only chance.
North Star,
can you find your way
back to that bell in time?
A mere trifle, Megan.
Then let's go!
It's time
to ring in some changes.
It's fading away.
But where are Megan
and North Star?
Look! Here they come!
You did it, Megan.
What happened to
Grogar and Bray?
They're gone,
back into the Realm of
Darkness with Tambelon.
Well, I hope you
and the rest of the Troggles
enjoy living in Ponyland, Drog.
I'm sure we will.
But I still can't believe
Grogar is really gone for good.
Well, it took him 500 years
to build the old bell
even with the Troggle's help.
So I don't think
he'll be back anytime soon.
Look!
You don't think
it's Grogar, do you?
Guess not.
