went to talk to who oh um i don't remember hey can i have that globe you're not using it right huh what about this book spike i'm worried about you you're usually not so grabby my arms aren't usually this long either what's happening to me well now what seems to be the problem this is spike his all right then let's just have a look see shall we widdle guy not feewing too good who's a brave widdle boy huh who's a brave one so what do you think doctor well i think i know what the problem is he's a dragon that's not the problem he's always been a dragon oh well that would explain it listen i don't know anything about dragons i know about baby ponies maybe you should try a vet okay thank you doctor hm well i'm flummoxed y'bring me a dog i've got it diagnosed in seconds snake even faster but to be honest i've never seen a real live dragon before who's a good boy who's a good boy sit thanks anyway c'mon spike ooh he is starting to mature of this fact i am quite sure mature so he's just growing up but that doesn't explain why he keeps grabbing things a dragon's heart is prone to greed a steady diet to make growth speed then the resulting bigger size only makes their hunger rise if this trait should go unchecked if spike continues to collect more growth will certainly occur â he is going to turn into a monster you mean the more things a dragon collects the bigger and greedier he gets but how do we stop him before he's completely out of control if his monstrous ways you wish to impede you must prevent him from practicing greed get away from her you brute spike want you're not getting my scooter spike want hey spike check out this amazing broom spike want c'mon big boy look at this incredible broom spike want fight all you want i'm not letting you out oh spike i just re-shelved this room what now now who in ponyville would steal my apples for that matter who would steal my leaves applejack help spike's running wild and i need you to lasso him oh that's a good one twilight sweet little spike running wild ha what a laugh twilight get my rope help huh don't tell me you-you tied yourselves up get us out of here right now what was that sounded like fluttershy to me fluttershy fluttershy i'm up here what happened i was helping my squirrel friends with a dance step and all of a sudden a giant r-rampaging d-d-d-dragon stormed through that was spike spike but why would spike steal my chicken coop he just pulled it out of the ground and filled it with a bunch of apples and stuff that sounded like pinkie pie c'mon girls back get back pinkie pie stop giving him cake i'm not giving him cake i'm assaulting him with cake how dare you take the cake he's completely out of control who knows where he'll go next put me down you brute how rude don't worry rarity we'll save you put her down right now i-if you wouldn't mind that is i mean it dragon boy we'll be ever so grateful if you'd be so kind as to possibly consider drop her scaly hey i'mâ not someâ sort of commonâ fly swatter girls my cape look the wonderbolts oh be quiet you've got nothing to be proud of you steal everypony's things terrorize the town and use me as a weapon against my own friends which as horrible as it is i can almost understand because you're a dragon and all but this this is a crime against fashion oh no you are not getting this gemstone this was given to me by my dear friend spikey-wikey the kindest sweetest most generous dragon ever and it is too precious to me to give to a greedy old beast like you flashback here rarity you take it it would mean even more to see you happy than to eat it myself flashback i i don't know what to say this is just so generous oh what now i suppose you'll be eating me or something spike you're the rampaging dragon somepony do something on it rarity i need to tell you something just in case we don't make it i've always sort of had a crushâ we did it i can't believe we did it all in a day's work spike i just have to tell you how absolutely proud i am of you proud of me yes it was you who stopped w-well you from destroying ponyville you are my hero spikey-wikey dear princess celestia we're getting closer i can hardly wait i'm so excited i-i feel like shouting woo-hoo hooo-wee canterlot here we come oh i do hope i look festive enough there it is canterlot oooh oh isn't canterlot wonderful this time of year yeah i wish it was hearth's warming eve every day there's so much to look at i feel like my durned eyes are gonna pop right out of my head i have an idea let's play i spy with my little eye as we walk i'll go first i spy an eight-foot candy cane i spy a snowpony i spy somepony eating a gingerbread house and it's me i can't believe that princess celestia chose us to put on the most important play of the season do you guys know what an honor this is for all of us oh i wish she hadn't honored me quite so much i can't go onstage i don't want everypony looking at me fluttershy darling there's nothing to feel nervous about no of course not all across equestria ponies are preparing their own pageants for hearth's warming eve in their own towns it's tradition so you're saying they'll be too busy to come to our play well no we're in the canterlot pageant the biggest most important production in all of equestria a lot of ponies will come to watch us a lot hundreds hundreds maybe even thousands oh my hair applejack be a dear and shut those windows will you aaah rain-bow-dash rain-bow-dash aaaah thank you thank you it's a reenactment of the founding of equestria it's not the rainbow dash show well it should be the rainbow dash show i'm the star fluttershy you've got to come out of there curtain in two minutes twilight let me handle this my hair pinkie the hearth's warming eve pageant is about harmony and friendship shut the window once upon a time long before the peaceful rule of celestia and before ponies discovered our beautiful land of equestria ponies did not know harmony it was a strange and dark time a time when ponies were torn apart by hatred during this frightful age each of the three tribes â the pegasi the unicorns and the earth ponies â cared not for what befell the other tribes but only for their own welfare in those troubled times as now the pegasi were the stewards of the weather but they demanded something in return food that could only be grown by the earth ponies the unicorns demanded the same in return for magically bringing forth day and night and so mistrust between the tribes festered until one fateful day it came to a boil and what prompted the ponies to clash twas a mysterious blizzard that overtook the land and toppled the tribes precarious peace the normally industrious earth ponies were unable to farm their land the earth ponies were freezing the home of the pegasi fared no better the pegasi were hungry and the unicorns were freezing and hungry even the unicorns magic was powerless against the storm each tribe blamed the others for their suffering and the angrier everypony grew the worse the blizzard became and so it was decided that a grand summit would be held to figure out a way to cope with the blizzard each tribe sent their leaders daughter of the unicorn king princess platinum ruler of the pegasi commander hurricane and lastly leader of the earth ponies chancellor puddinghead perhaps the three tribes could finally settle their differences and agree on a way to get through this disaster hmph and the blizzard raged on so the summit of the tribes did not turn out as well as hoped and the three leaders returned home to lick their wounds and basically complain and so each leader encountered obstacles along the way but eventually they all arrived in a new and wondrous land nopony had ever seen paradise before and so the paradise that the ponies had found was soon lost buried beneath a thick blanket of snow and hard feelings instead of beautiful it was blizzardy instead of wonderful it was wintry instead of spectacular it was snow-tacular instead ofâ we get it move on everypony was forced to seek shelter they searched high and low but the only shelter for miles was a cold and desolate cave and of course the three tribes had to share it and nopony was too happy about that and it even began to melt their hearts the three leaders agreed to share the beautiful land and live in harmony ever afterwards and together they named their new land equestria we should be so honored that princess celestia chose us she must really think we exemplify what good friends are applejack i thought you closed all the windows don't blame me rainbow dash should've flown up there and shut it after all she's got wings why do i always have to do all the high up chores why can't twilight use her magic for a change

what are you doing here did you miss the train er no it came and uncle apple strudel was on it ooooooh noogie-noogie-noggie i can't wait to hear granny smith's presentation if she can remember any of it long ago when i was a little pony things were very different here in ponyville cause there was no ponyville that's right my little ponies me and my family were pilgrim pony folk back when i was a little filly oh we ventured far and wide collecting new seeds and sellin the old but my pa was the finest seed collector in all of equestria then one day the smith family found themselves in the most brilliant most grand most magnificent of all cities a place called canterlot well i bet your hooves to hindquarters i had never seen anything like it before nor since and as if the beauty of that city wasn't enough suddenly she appeared princess celestia the most regal of all ponies when lo and behold she stopped to look at my pa's seed collection then princess celestia saw that we were plumb-tuckered and hankerin to find our forever home and bein a royal princess and all she knew exactly the place for us to lay down our stakes my pa gave the princess a mighty thanks we quickly found that land near the everfree forest and we built our first home next we planted our first orchards but an orchard don't grow overnight and we were getting mighty short on food now mind you we were cautioned about the forest and we knew that it was not fit to enter but i knew there was critters livin there there must be somethin to eat it was dark and musty and i won't lie it was scary but every inch was covered in plant life and before i knew it wasn't i standin in front of the most incredible apple trees i had never seen anything that bore this kind of colorful fruit oh i started picking apples quick as a whip i turned and there before me stood the timberwolves i've never run so fast in my life i did the only thing i could think of my pa and i planted those special apple seeds and before our eyes they grew like wildfire why we had full grown trees faster than you could say lickety split then each year i paid close attention to the signs of the zap apples special harvesting times how the weather affects the everfree forest how the timberwolves howl when the zap apples first start growing and how they zapped away if you didn't pick em all in one day and the fruits of our labor were the best fruit we ever tasted soon enough i was mixing up batches of zap apple jam just like harvestin the zap apples had its special rules so did makin zap apple jam i learned that you gotta be extra friendly with the bees otherwise their honey won't taste rightly sweet to mix in with the zap apples who'd'a thought that glass jars needed talkin to or that zap apples like pink polka dots but magic is as magic does just funny that way then ponies started comin to our farm from far and wide just to get a taste of my zap apple jam some of them decided to stay like stinkin rich diamond tiara's great grandfather matter of fact the first thing he ever sold was my zap apple jam and before we knew it we had ourselves a nice little town bustling with all kinds of ponies and that is how ponyville was founded oh thank you kindly little ponies oh now now let's settle down so if it weren't for you and the zap apples ponyville wouldn't even exist darn tootin little filly if it weren't for my granny smith your daddy wouldn't have barnyard bargains butâ but she's just a kooky old lady she is not a kooky old lady she is the most amazing pony in all of ponyville i think this is the best zap apple jam i've tasted yet must be cause you had something to do with it apple bloom you betcha apple bloom is one humdinger of a zap apple jammer i am so i take it family appreciation day

still dark c'mon fluttershy cider season's about to start oh where are we what's the rush the rush don't you remember what happened last year or the year before that or pretty much any cider season ever um well uhâ pinkie pie she always ends up ahead of us in line and then they always run out of cider i guess iâ well not this year this year i'm gonna get there before sunrise so i can drink all the cider i want and laugh when she doesn't get any it's the perfect plan y'know i might even buy some cider and hold onto it for a while drinking it drop by drop in front of herâ gee rainbow dash it looks like a few other ponies had the same idea oh gosh pinkie i love your new style who are all these ponies isn't this great i couldn't sleep last night cause i was so excited about cider season and i had this brilliant idea to come down here and camp out so i told a few others about it and they all thought it was a great idea too and now it's just a big old cider party woo-hoo oh gosh that's a lot of ponies hope they don't run out before you get any isn't this exciting spike opening day of cider season yeah that means it's only thirty more days til sapphire season attention everypony cider season is now officially open heh sorry everypony that's it for today awww surprise surprise you ran out again yeah you always run out for the record i don't mindâ why can't you make enough cider for all of us or at least for me hold on everypony we've done our best to improve supply this year you always say that and it's always true but apple family cider is made with love and integrity and only the highest quality apples in equestria sorry but that recipe takes time if y'all just be patient we'll have plenty more tomorrow she's right y'know you can't rush perfection and this year's batch was perfection uh pinkie pieâ i'll never forget the cider i just drank it was a moment in time that will never exist again what in equestria is that you got a deal not so fast no way no how that machine matches up with the care we put in our cider but if it really does work we could make everypony in town happy i just don't know y'all we've always made cider the same way eeyup huh we'll sweeten the deal you supply the apples we supply the super speedy cider squeezy #### then we split those sweet sweet profits seventy-five twenty-five dealâ hold on who gets the seventy five why us naturally and we'll throw in the magic to power the machine for free cider sales keep our business afloat through the winter we'd lose sweet apple acres if we agreed to this so what'll it be no deal hmph very well if you refuse our generous offer to be partners then we'll just have to be competitors you wouldn't dare oh no don't you worry everypony there'll be plenty of cider for all of you once we drive sweet apple acres out of business what still worried about flim and flam granny smith says they were just blowing hot air i'm not so sure they sounded mighty serious when they threatened to run us out of business that's it last cup oh for pete's sake c'mon back tomorrow everypony what seems to be the problem here oh my oh my out of cider again what have we here who'd like a cup don't worry everypony we've got the super speedy cider squeezy #### to make more in an instant you can't sell that cider that's made from apple family apples is this some kind of cruel joke don't worry everypony there are plenty of apples in equestria we'll find some others and make more cider than all of ponyville can drink we'll make more cider than you could ever imagine now it ain't about the speed young'un it's about quality who cares how good the cider is if i never get to drink any oh look at these poor dissatisfied ponies ponyville is sweet apple cider country our cider speaks for itself let's put it to the test anywhere anytime well that's enough now with our machine we can make enough cider in one hour to satisfy this entire town we'll do it in ## minutes easy apple bloom easy what's the matter granny smith chicken what did you call me sonny if you're so confident in your cider then what's the problem tomorrow mornin right here but i'm afraid we haven't any apples you can use our south field it'll be worth it to teach y'all a thing or two about cider making excellent we have a bet whoever produces the most barrels in one hour wins the exclusive right to sell cider in ponyville and after we beat ya i don't never want to see you bambahoozlers around here again until tomorrow don't worry applejack i know you'll win tomorrow we'd better cause if we don't we're gonna lose our farm applejack are you sure this is such a good idea me n the family are one hundred percent confident in our cider making capabilities and besides nopony calls granny a chicken attention everypony well

in the jungle had injured her wing and she was grounded for a few days few days it might as well be a few months or a few years huh i'm right there with you sister the mosquitoes buzzed loudly the macaws cried from the high trees yet all of these distracting noises were not enough to cover the sound of the predators following her every step safely landing on the other side daring finally allowed herself a moment to breathe she turned around to find herself face to face with the long lost temple that she had sought tirelessly for over sixty days and nights i hate to admit it to myself and would really hate to admit it to my friends but i love this story i i i love reading i'm an egghead the smell of decay and danger hit daring do as she peered into the dimly-lit entrance of the

very sorry about this i mentioned to the girls that i don't have a very special somepony and i believe they're putting us in these awkward situations because they've decided it should be you i suppose

uh-oh whaddaya mean uh-oh we might not have given big mac and miss cheerilee a love potion we may have given them a love poison what apparently some prince a long time ago whipped up this recipe and gave it to this princess he liked he meant it to be a love potion but things didn't turn out so well how not so well did things turn out well there's something here about a dragon the kingdom falling chaos reigning okay apparently it was all because the prince and princess were so lost in each other's eyes that they couldn't perform their royal duties great we've not only turned big mac and miss cheerilee into a couple of nonsense-spoutin nincompoops we may have put all of ponyville in jeopardy come on apple bloom miss cheerilee and big mac don't have any royal duties but they still got responsibilities if we don't fix this oh no miss cheerilee won't be able to teach big mac won't be able to harvest any apples and before you know it ponyville will be overrun with uneducated little ponies starvin for apples oh it'll be chaos it'll be chaos there's an antidote well why didn't you say so didn't you see me gettin all panicked back there if we can keep miss cheerilee and big mac

bottom of a pit we may have given you the teeny-tiniest bit of love potion that may have turned out to actually be a love poison and you may have gone just a teeny-tiniest bit nutty but we only did it because we thought you and big mac would be really happy if you could be each others very special someponies on hearts and hooves day our hearts and hooves were in the right place we appreciate that you care about us and want us to be happy butâ but no matter how good our intentions might have been we shoulda never meddled in your relationship nopony can force two ponies to be together it's up to

that'd be a big no oh well they should how about flexing some of your muscles for me oh my heavens do you think a strong handsome stallion such as yourself could give my friend the last asparagus nuhh see that's not so hard is it um i guess not alright then what else is on your list let's see i also need tomatoes here you go that'll be two bits not one oh but last week it was only one bit that was then this is now oh okay i don't wanna argue about it what do you think you're doing mindin my own business maybe you should try it two bits for tomatoes is outrageous one bit is the right price i say it's two bits one bit two bits one bit two bits one bit two bits two bits one bit two bits one bit i insist it's two bits or nothing one bit and that's my final offer have it your way one bit it is see asserting yourself can be fun i guess you're right so fluttershy do you feel like giving it a try um okay boy am i glad you have one cherry left you see i'm making this special meal for my bunny angel he's a very picky eater and the recipe calls for a cherry on top here you go so you say you need this cherry very badly oh yes i'm desperate for it then it'll be ten bits ten oh hey mister handsome i know you wanna do the right thing because you're handsome and strong and big handsome strong guys are always nice to everypony right ten bits for the cherry ten bits for one cherry's outrageous i insist on paying you eleven bits eleven bits umm i mean nine bits er now wait a minute okay twelve bits but that's my final offer i think you're confused it's twelve bits take it or leave it okay i'll take it don't give him your money one cherry is not worth twelve bits but i was only doing what you did it was a valiant effort but you should refuse to give him your business and just walk away but i can't let angel starve he won't eat it unless i make it just right i need that cherry no matter what it costs in that case twenty bits twenty oh but i don't have that much then why're you wasting my time i'll give you two bits for that cherry sold eh tough break kid next time don't be such a doormat ta-da here you go angel sorry there's no cherry on top but the rest of it is

well perhaps that is enough water thank you i can't believe it worked showpony business is tough go ahead try one of your jokes out on me i laugh at everything okay okay okay a donkey and a mule are stuck on a desert island excuse me would you mind moving your carts so i can pass yeah yeah in a minute i just wanna finish up this story and so the donkey says to the muleâ a-hemmmm can you move you're blocking my path yeah yeah in a minute so the donkey says to the mule why don't we build a boat to get off this island when somepony tries to block show them that you rock and the mule saysâ ugh easy does it lady we're moving okay good who's next please and what can i get for you today what do you think you're doing didn't you see me uh i guess maybe maybe maybes are for babies now go to the back of the line where you belong heyyy look at you oh your attitude is so feisty it's fabulous looks like that monster's workshop really paid off iron will's not a monster he's a minotaur and a true inspiration his techniques really work well they've certainly made a difference in the way you carry yourself you truly are a whole new fluttershy yes i am and new fluttershy feels pretty stoked about new fluttershy well old pinkie pie feels really proud of new fluttershy proud as pink punch want some you laugh at me i wrath at you bye girls what a day taxi oh no you don't cut in line i'll take what's mine aieeeeee ow nopony pushes new fluttershy around nopony old pinkie pie is not so sure new fluttershy is such a good idea after all old rarity agrees you got this new fluttershy this day is yours and nopony's gonna take it away from you am i right right what he's delivered the wrong mail again ohâ and new fluttershy does not want the wrong mail delivered to her cottage ohh did i mix em up again sorry about that you apologize i penalize oh excuse me do you know how to get to the ponyville tower oh that's a shame you make me lose i blow my fuse hey fluttershy what are you doing that's no way to behave didn't you see what he did to new fluttershy and he thought new fluttershy was a pushover no sweetie he didn't we saw the whole thing we think that you've taken your assertiveness training a little too far what you just want new fluttershy to be a doormat like old fluttershy but old fluttershy is gone new fluttershy old fluttershy what happened to nice fluttershy we want that fluttershy back no you want wimp fluttershy you want pushover fluttershy you want do-anything-to-her-and-she-won't-complain fluttershy nyaaaaah too many fluttershys to keep track of make it stop things getting too complicated for your simple little brain pinkie pie now stop right there let's not let things descend into petty insults why not i thought petty was what you're all about rarity with your petty concerns about fashion hey leave her alone fashion is her passion oh and what are you passionate about birthday cake party hats i can't believe that the two most frivolous ponies in ponyville are trying to tell new fluttershy how to live her life when they are throwing their own lives away on pointless pursuits that nopony else gives a flying feather about looks like nasty fluttershy is here to stay i cannot believe what that monster iron will has done to you iron will's not a monster he's a minotaur i'm the monster fluttershy are you in there it's pinkie pie and rarity go away go away before nasty fluttershy strikes again oh sweetie we all said things that we regret we did shh but don't worry i'm never coming out of my house again everypony will be a lot safer with me and my mean mouth locked away pinkie pie doesn't blame you nor do i you just received some bad advice from that iron will character yeah he's the one that made you act super-duper nasty what i mean is there are other ways to assert yourself besides yelling at everypony yes you can stand up for yourself without being unpleasant about it i-i'm not sure i can i'm too far gone whenever i try to assert myself i become a monster oh sweetie you're not a monster no but he is iron will's my name training ponies is my game what a darling little catchphrase your friend fluttershy loved iron will's catchphrases word on the street is that she doesn't take no guff from nopony so iron will is here to collect iron will's fee fluttershy is in no shape to deal with that creep i'm sure a big brave powerful and rich monsterâ i mean minotaur like you doesn't need that money right away you can afford to come back later are you kidding fluttershy is overdue as it is iron will collects now do something we're not even sure fluttershy is home right now uh she might be off frolicking with some woodland creatures uh why don't you give us some time to track her down for ya iron will does have some grocery shopping to do iron will will come back this afternoon but that's only half a day we need one full day at least iron will will delay for half a day and no longer a full day half day full day half day half day full day we need half a day and no more well you'll get a full day and no less okie-dokie see you tomorrow wait what huh sounds like the search won't be necessary iron will collects now but we had an agreement you gotta come back tomorrow when somepony tries to block show them that you rock your payment is overdue fluttershy you were nothing but a doormat and iron will turned you into a lean mean assertive machine now pay iron will what you owe iron will um no what did you say no ohhh i'd hate to be you right now because iron will is gonna to rain down a world of hurt unless iron will gets his money pronto as i recall during your workshop you promised one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed or you pay nothing well i'm not satisfied what do you mean you're not satisfied everypony has always been satisfied well i guess i'm the first then but since i'm not satisfied i refuse to pay it's as simple as that ohh are you sure you're not just a little bit satisfied b-because maybe we could cut a deal i-i mean we're both reasonable creatures aren't we i'm sorry but no means no no means no huh nopony's ever said that to me before huh i gotta remember that one that's a good catchphrase for my next workshop you were amazing fluttershy you totally stood up to that monster in fact you didn't change at all you were the same old fluttershy that we've always loved the one we missed don't worry old fluttershy's back for good i'm sorry i took the whole assertiveness thing too far friends friends dear princess celestia i want to start our field trip here in the world-famous canterlot sculpture garden that one over there represents friendship all right my little ponies this one represents victory how cool would it be to have that for a cutie mark cool if you were actually victoryful at somethin that's not a word what are you a dictionary girls now this is a really interesting statue what do you notice about it it's got an eagle claw and a lion paw and a snake tail this creature is called a draconequus he has the head of a pony and a body made up of all sorts of things what do you suppose that represents confusion evil chaos it's not chaos you dodo don't call me things i don't know the meaning of and it is too chaos is not you're both wrong actually in a way you're all right this statue represents discord which means a lack of harmony between ponies in fact you three have demonstrated discord so well that you're each going to write me an essay explaining it now let's go and i don't want anymore fighting it's confusion evil chaos come back here you gotcha eww what is this cotton candy wait a second it's not supposed to rain until tomorrow you can't justâ you did hey i didn't tell you to go anywhere rainbow dash what's going on with this rain i mean chocolate milk i mean chocolate milk rain there's crazy weather all over equestria cloudsdale is getting soaked by a major cola storm right now but don't worry i'm not leaving you until i get control of ponyville why would you wanna stop this ahem i heard about your troubles applejack and i came to see if there's anything i can do without getting wet or dirty or out from under my umbrella fluttershy do somethin now angel you really shouldn'tâ no it's not possible i must be seeing things don't worry everyone i've learned a new spell that'll fix everything my fail-safe spell failed what do we do uh give up spike twilight will come up with something hmm time for plan b rainbow can you corral all those clouds in one corner of the sky applejack i need you to bring those high-strung storm clouds down to earth hey what happened oh dear i hope none of the animals see these delicious chocolate-filled cotton candy clouds i'd hate to have to share them you and me both sister hey and when y'all are done with that feel free to have some popcorn for dessert you see spike you should never give up there's nothing we can't overcome if we all work together come on girls princess celestia wants to see us all in canterlot immediately princess celestia we came as fast as we could thank you twilight thank you all is this about the weather and the animals weird behavior what's happening out there why isn't my magic working is thereâ follow me i've called you here for a matter of great importance it seems an old foe of mine someone i thought i had defeated long ago has returned his name is discord discord is the mischievous spirit of disharmony before my sister and i stood up to him he ruled equestria in an eternal state of unrest and unhappiness luna and i saw how miserable life was for earth ponies pegasi and unicorns alike so after discovering the elements of harmony we combined our powers and rose up against him turning him to stone all right princess i thought the spell we cast would keep him contained forever but since luna and i are no longer connected to the elements the spell has been broken no longer connected this is canterlot tower where the elements are kept inside since all of you recovered them i need you to wield the elements of harmony once again and stop discord before he thrusts all of equestria into eternal chaos but why us why don't you hey look we're famous you six showed the full potential of the elements by harnessing the magic of your friendship to beat a mighty foe although luna and i once wielded the elements it is you who now control their power and it is you who must defeat discord princess celestia you can count onâ hold on a second eternal chaos comes with chocolate rain you guys chocolate rain don't listen to her princess we'd be honored to use the elements of harmony again ooh you can keep the elements i'll take that case have no fear ponies i have total confidence that you will be able to defeat discord with these oh well if anyone needs me i'll be outside in the chocolate puddles with a giant swizzle straw the elements they're gone that chamber is protected by a powerful spell that only i can break this doesn't make sense make sense oh what fun is there in making sense discord show yourself did you miss me celestia i missed you it's quite lonely being encased in stone but you wouldn't know that would you because i don't turn ponies into stone enough what have you done with the elements of harmony oh i just borrowed them for a teensy little while you'll never get away with this discord oh i'd forgotten how grim you can be celestia it's really quite boring hey nopony insults the princess oh you must be rainbow dash famed for her loyalty the element of harmony you represent that's right i'll always be loyal to the princess we'll see about that i can't believe we're wasting our time talking to a tacky window the beautiful rarity representing the element of generosity if i'm not mistaken so you know who we are big deal oh i know much more than that honest applejack you seem to know our strengths too yes twilight sparkle and yours is the most powerful and elusive element magic fluttershy's is kindness and pinkie pie's is a personal favorite of mine laughter pinkie he's standing on your head stop stalling discord what have you done with the elements of harmony oh so boring celestia really fine i'll tell you but i'll only tell you my way to retrieve your missing elements just make sense of this change of events twists and turns are my master plan then find the elements back where you began can we go home now what do you reckon he meant twists and turns and ending back where we started twists and turns twists and turns twists and turns that's it i bet discord hid the elements in the palace labyrinth good luck my little ponies the fate of equestria is in your hooves thanks princess we won't let you down w-we have to go in there nope dopey discord forgot about these babies i'll just do a quick flyover and we'll have the elements in no time my wings your horn my horn ahhh give us our wings and horns back you'll get them back in good time i simply took them to ensure there's no cheating you see this is the first rule of our game no flying and no magic the first rule the second rule is everypony has to play or the game is over and i win good luck everypony never fear girls we have each other yeah like twilight said there's nothing we can't overcome if we all stick together all right girls let's do this together stay calm girls everypony head to the middle as fast as you can and we'll regroup there moving out see you in the center yee-haw see you guys there what's that who's there girls what in tarnation where am i who are y'all the keepers of the grove of truth you may ask us one question past future or present but be warned that the truth may not always be pleasant all right then i don't trust this place worth a hill of beans but i've got a really bad feelin about this feller discord what's gonna come of this mission we're on for the answer you seek go ahead take a peek i hope i never see you again me too fine fine it's settled then no our friendship over it can't be true it just can't that just can't be the truth when all the truth does is make your heart ache sometimes a lie is easier to take applejack thank goodness i thought i heard voices over here who were you talking to i was talking to uh nopony nopony whatsoever what nothing come on uh we best be going did applejack just come on twilight applejack wouldn't lie hey what gives what's the matter pinkie pie i thought you appreciated a good laugh it's different they're laughing at me it's hardly different your friends laugh at you all the

face for sheer beauty what do you think you like yes i like very much no no i shan't succumb to such fabulousness must get to the center to meet the others mine well rarity it took forever but it was worth it who knew three little gemstones would turn out to be this handsome hunk of a diamond now to get you home rarity are we glad to see why are you carrying a humongous boulder what do you mean boulder this big beautiful bedazzling rock is a diamond and it's all mine keep your envious little eyes off it i found it and it's mine fair and square oh wait a minute butterflies wait don't leave me here fluttershy looks like you've been left behind by your so-called friends huh oh no i'm certain they're doing their best to find me well it must be so upsetting to know how weak and helpless they think you are not at all i am weak and helpless and i appreciate their understanding yes well surely it burns you up i mean that they're always pointing out your flaws right not really in fact i think i'm awfully lucky to have friends who want me to be the best i can be oh for goodness sake you've been kind for far too long my dear time to be cruel arrivederci fluttershy i'm so glad to see a friendly face this awful labyrinth is getting to everypony grrr aw boo-hoo-hoo why don't you wave your magic little horn and make everything all right uh oh that's right you can't you don't have one what is happening to my friends and what are you laughing at chocolate milk little help here thanks twilight you're welcomeâ but don't get any ideas about my gem i know where you live i've got you now element oh i can see why you like these clouds so much very plush get off there and put em up come on let's go hey i'm here to deliver a message i've got a message for you too listen closely this is important a weighty choice is yours to make â a right selection or a big mistake if a wrong choice you choose to pursue the foundations of home will crumble without you cloudsdale crumble without me no that box contains your wings you can take them and leave the game or you can carry on aimlessly wandering this maze your choice must find rainbow dash as a team we're unstoppable rainbow dash won't let us down well looky there rainbow dash is flying away she's abandonin us now i know that's a lie how can it be well well well somepony broke the no wings no magic rule i made it for you rarity why yes it is an ice cream house chocolate fudge shingles rocky road garage huh twilight oh hi spike it's the middle of the night why are you pacing like this frankly i don't know how you can sleep at a time like this three a.m it's awful it's horrible it's tragic eh i don't understand what's wrong here now do you see what's wrong we forgot to celebrate arbor day no the problem is i just finished planning my schedule for the month but i forgot to leave time to plan for next month don't you see there's no time in my schedule to put together another schedule i could move my meeting with the ponyville hay board to the following tuesday but then i have to reschedule my lunch with pinkie pie and you know what a nightmare she is with scheduling this is an absolute disaster my whole year could be thrown off and i woke up from an ice cream dream for this oh my gosh i think i did it if i can find a way to read the art of invisibility spells and thornhoof's brief history of canterlot at the same time that could leave me a half-hour scheduling window huh what's going on twilight you've got to listen to me who are you i mean you're me but i'm me too how can there be two me's it's not scientifically possible you are not scientifically possible twilight please i have a very important message for you from the future you're from the future that's right now listenâ what happened to you the future must be awful please i don't have much time is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something actually i'm from next tuesday morning but that's not important right now i can't believe time travel is really possible how did you i mean i figure it out the time spells are in the canterlot archives but that's notâ really where i've never seen them they're in the star swirl the bearded wing now you have to listen toâ is time travel fun or does it hurt i have so many questionsâ i have something extremely important to tell you about the future and i only have a few seconds so you've got to listen whatever you do don'tâ future twilight oh no what was she trying to warn me about her clothes her mane that scar oh what a mess she is i mean i am or i will be c'mon fluttershy the party can't start until the party supplies get there happy to help but can i carry the balloons next time oh listen everypony i've got something really important to say this is no laughing matter we have a crisis on our hooves i've just been visited by myself from the future this isn't a joke my future self tried to warn me about a horrible disaster that's going to occur sometime before next tuesday morning what kind of disaster i don't know i got sucked back into the future before i could explain run for your liiiiiiiife what ever should we do twilight how do we stop the disaster if we don't know what it is we'll just have to work together to make sure we're safe rainbow dash you and the other pegasi spread out over equestria and look for any kind of problem that could lead to a disaster and i mean anything you got it everypony elseâ everypony else time to disaster-proof equestria eeyup done and done and done applejack what about the everfree forest the perimeter's clear great and my team gave the all clear from fillydelphia to las pegasus excellent well we've done everything on the list but still future twilight looked like she'd been through a horrible ordeal i just have this nagging feeling we should be looking for something bigger than loose bolts and leaky pipes okay everypony follow my lead what is that thing that's cerberus he's supposed to be guarding the gates of tartarus but if he's here then all the ancient evil creatures that have been imprisoned there could escape and destroy equestria destroy equestria yeah isn't it great hey cerberus you look like you could use some obedience training magic obedience training huh who's the cute widdle three-headed dog wow i knew you were good with animals but this is amazing aww he's just a big furry guy who got out of his yard that's all right cerberus who's a good boy who's a good boy pinkie yes twilight do you have a ball i can borrow i have balls stashed all over ponyville in case of ball emergency hey cerberus look what i have i'll be back as soon as i've returned him to the gates of tartarus once he's back at home there'll be no disaster i wish twilight would go on epic adventures more often best night's sleep i've had in weeks hey twilight how'd it go with cerberus great i got him back before any of the evil creatures could escape hurrh huâ oh no what's the big deal it's just a lost dog flyer i guess the princess hasn't heard we found cerberus yet it's not that it's this a paper cut come on twilight you really need to toughen up just clean it out and you'll be fine the cut's in the exact same spot as the scar on future twilight's cheek we haven't changed the future at all the disaster is still coming if the disaster wasn't caused by cerberus getting loose then what could it possibly be i dunno but maybe you ought to give the pacing a rest you've worn a groove into the floor i don't have time for another one of your lectures spike this is serious my lectures i did everything i could think of to change the future but it didn't work so maybe it's not what i do maybe it's what i don't do huh if i stand right here and don't move a muscle until next tuesday i can't possibly do whatever it is that future twilight wanted to warn me not to do really so no matter what happens you're not gonna move a muscle huh then maybe you won't mind if i eat an entire tub of ice cream mmm spike stop think of the stomach ache stomach ache huh that's future spike's problem hey twilight another pegasus just got back from baltimare with an all-clear andâ what's going on aren't you gonna stop him she sure isn't in fact she's not gonna move til next tuesday she thinks it'll prevent the disaster from happening hey twilight there's a mouse right behind you wait wait wait let me try whoa-oaâ oh no what happened i'm so sorry i didn't mean to it was a total accident show me uhhh i'm not so sure that's aâ show me oh no this is the same mane cut as future twilight y'know it really doesn't look too bad i don't care how it looks it's just another sign that the future hasn't changed not doing anything didn't work either oh i wish there was a way to know what was going to happen so i could stop it you wanna see the future i might know somepony who can help what's this it's madame pinkie's place madame pinkie do you like my mystical orb of fate's destiny i just got it cool huh yeah uh best one i've seen look deep into the crystal ball for soon it will reveal all ah yes i see something it is a vision of the future i see you twilight you will get a really cool birthday present next year yes and that's it are you sure yep cool birthday present pinkie i need your pinkie sense to tell me what the impending disaster is that future twilight was trying to warn me about oh my fortunetelling has nothing to do with my pinkie sense silly it's only good for vague and immediate events like that see where did that even come from lalalalalalala lalalala gosh i haven't seen twilight since the flowerpot incident hope she still isn't mad uhhhh off by point zero two from yesterday carry the fifteen negative azimuth on the fourteenth moon hey pinkie twilight's really serious about finding out about that cool birthday present isn't she who cares as long as i can keep eating ice cream sorry future spike are you okay ah pinkie i'm glad you're here can you help me recalibrate the apertures on the nine-and-quarter catadioptric telescopes sure so i was thinking after i came to see madame pinkie and the flowerpot landed on my headâ see the bandage just like the bandage from the future nice i had an epiphany after that flowerpot doing things didn't work not doing things didn't work and i couldn't predict the future either so i only had one other choice monitor everything makes sense to me that way no matter what happens in the future i'll be ready i thought i saw something last night in the horsehead nebula but after staring at it for three straight hours i realized i was wrong three hours but when did you sleep oh i didn't sleep i haven't slept since future twilight was here there are only three days left until next tuesday i can sleep all i want after that you've been awake too long twilight yeah tuesday's not three days from now tuesday's tomorrow pinkie did you finish recalibrating the apertures on the nine-and-quarter-inch catadioptric telescopes i have no idea ah my eye don't worry twilight i have eye patches stashed all over ponyville in case of eye patch emergency there now you look like a pirate a sleepy pirate with a really weird mane cut the eye patch another sign nearly all the signs have come true i haven't done a thing to prevent the catastrophe if tuesday's tomorrow and the disaster happens by tuesday morning then there's only one solution i'll just have to stop time okay the canterlot archives are right over there let's move uhh i don't think we need to sneak around twilight it's not illegal to walk around canterlot that was close i dunno why we have to wear these things either aren't we wearing them for fun no there's nothing fun about this oh are you sure focus guys the only way to prevent this disaster is to stop time time spells are kept in the star swirl the bearded wing the most secure section of the archives that's why we're sneaking around awesome that sounds fun no it's not fun aww i still don't understand how sneaking into the archives is gonna help her find out about her birthday present the coast is clear now slowly lift me into the window so we canâ ah let's get this over with okay if my calculations are correct the star swirl the bearded wing should be right here uh twilight what is it spike isn't this where we came in cool can we climb in the window again that was super fun i don't understand it's supposed to be right here how are we supposed to find it now maybe we should ask somepony in the star swirl the bearded wing huh how'd i miss that look at all those priceless magic scrolls there are more than i ever imagined twilight the guard what do we do what do we do hey twilight haven't seen you in a while let me open that for ya thanks oh no oof oh look i look just like future twilight the last sign has come true and that's bad right come on it's almost tuesday morning the disaster could happen at any moment but how do we find the time-stopping spell there must be a million scrolls here i don't know twilight it's over it's officially tuesday morning nnngh no tuesday morning the disaster incoming i dunno twilight i don't see any disasters looks like a pretty nice day good morning twilight love the new hairstyle well happy tuesday why isn't anypony surprised to see me sneaking around in here is it possible there never was a disaster that i've just been making myself frantic over nothing i don't get it if future twilight wasn't warning you about a disaster then what was she trying to tell you i don't know but i do know one thing i look ridiculous yeah you do and it's all because i couldn't stop worrying and let the future handle itself well not anymore from now on i'm gonna solve problems as they come and stop worrying about every little thing that's great does that mean there won't be any more late night pacing no more late night pacing if only i had learned this lesson a week ago we wouldn't have had to go through all this twilight twilight i found something it doesn't stop time but it lets you go back in time it says you can go back once and it only lasts for a few moments does that help pinkie you're a genius woo-hoo now i can go back and tell past twilight that she doesn't need to go berserk with worry about a disaster that's never gonna come twilight you've got to listen to me who are you i mean you're me but i'm me too how can there be two me's it's not scientifically possible you are not scientifically possible twilight please i have a very important message for you from the future you're from the future that's right now listenâ what happened to you the future must be awful please i don't have much time is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something actually i'm from next tuesday morning but that's not important right now i can't believe time travel is really possible how did you i mean i figure it out the time spells are in the canterlot archives but that's notâ really where i've never seen them they're in the star swirl the bearded wing now you have to listen toâ is time travel fun or does it hurt i have so many questionsâ i have something extremely important to tell you about the future and i only have a few seconds so you've got to listen whatever you do don'tâ â waste your time worrying about ugh i can't believe i just did that did you tell her about the cool birthday present remember last week when future twilight came to warn me about something that was me trying to warn myself not to worry so much now i'm gonna spend the next week freaking out about a disaster that doesn't even exist ugh ah don't worry about it it's past twilight's problem now huh i guess you're right pinkie ohhh my stomach i i think it's all that ice cream i thought the stomach ache would be future spike's problem but now i am future spike ohh come on future spike let's get you home c'mon fluttershy it'll be fun there's nothing fun about dragons scary yes fun no but fluttershy the great dragon migration happens only once in a generation do you really wanna pass up a chance like that now that you put it that way yes aw fluttershy we just don't want you to miss out miss out on what dragons big scaly fire-breathing dragons well yeah thanks but no thanks look fluttershy i watched that boring butterfly migration with you so now it's your turn to watch the dragon migration with me you owe me i said no yeaagh ugh okay i guess i'll let you off the hook this time i don't see any dragons me neither me neither neither shoot you don't think we missed them do you no i don't think so we're just a little early and i'm glad we are this way we can watch every moment of the migration without bringing any unwanted attention to ourselves yoo-hoo well what do you think am i the toast of the trench or what you'll be toast alright when the dragons see you parading around in that getup you look very nice rarity but could you maybe look nice down here in the trench with us nice is an understatement i look fabulous who says camouflage has to be drab ahoy maties dragons ho oooh ahhhh wow amazing pfft pretty lame move is that all they've got what do ya think of that move rainbow dash still think they're lame uh not so much the word fierce comes to mind and formidable and super-duper scary yeah us dragons are definitely a force to be reckoned with yeah right spike that's one of the scariest aprons i've ever seen what's wrong with wearing an apron you won't be laughing when you spill blueberries all over your scales feathers that's one tough stain one tough stain against one lame dragon you leave him alone rainbow dash spike's style is unique he doesn't have to look like other dragons or act like them my little spikey-wikey is perfect the way he is i don't act like other dragons oh not even close but why would you want to spike yes you've got something those dreadfully fierce dragons can only dream of what's that the cutest widdle chubby cheeks ooooo cute dragons aren't supposed to be cute right oh sweetie you are turning the most delightful shade of red it is most becoming rrrgh oh isn't he adorable when he waddles off in anger waddle rrrrrggggh what am i where am i from who am i supposed to be uuugh i don't know for the last time spike you were given to me as an egg i don't know who found you or where they found you seriously that's all you know i'm sorry spike that doesn't tell me anything about who i am i need answers i feel like i'm i'm looking at a complete stranger oh oh spike why don't we do some late-night research see what we can find out really you'd do that of course i'm sure we can find something nothing nothing in this one either nothing at all about dragons this is getting

than you could ever be now if you don't back off you'll see what us ponies do when confronted by a huge group of jerky dragons oh yeah what's that run away nyuh phew that was a close one thanks you guys of course what are friends for you're more than friends you're my family dear princess celestia aww hey welcome to the family peewee stick with me i've got plenty to teach you about being a pony calling all pegasus ponies meeting tonight mandatory meeting for all ponyville pegasi library tonight be cool or be mule no offense none taken all right go on in find a seat ohh you too fluttershy come on let's go every living thing depends on the life-giving nourishment of rainwater and it is up to cloudsdale to provide rain-filled clouds to every corner of equestria but how one pony might ask does cloudsdale gather all this extra water tornado power that's right pegasi-driven tornado power a team of pegasi combine their wing power to create a jumbo tornado powerful enough to pull water out of the local reservoir and funnel it all the way up to cloudsdale remember pegasi your jumbo tornado must reach a minimum of eight hundred wing power to lift that water up to cloudsdale so the next time you're wondering where does all that extra rainwater come from just rememâ uh intermission so here's the scoop cloudsdale has chosen our own highland reservoir as a source of the rainwater they need for all of equestria and you know what that means it means it's up to ponyville's pegasi to bring that water up to cloudsdale not only that but spitfire captain of the wonderbolts will be here to oversee the water transfer and record our top tornado windspeed now last year fillydelphia broke the windspeed record with a top speed of nine hundred and ten wing power but i think we can do better i think we can get a top speed over a thousand if each and every pony trains and trains hard to get their wing power numbers up that coughing better be from a popcorn kernel thunderlane nopony's getting sick on my watch so are we gonna train hard yeah are we gonna be strong yeah are we gonna be fast yeah record-smashing fast yeah who's with me woo-hoo fluttershy stretch those glutes flitter nice flexibility cloudchaser a little too much flexibility blossomforth uh somepony give blossomforth a hoof let's see some faster trotting thunderlane good pace silverspeed keep it up we're gonna need all the wing power we can get to break that record yeah good work everypony everypony except fluttershy fluttershy i know you're in there you're avoiding tornado duty and i want to know why fluttershy openâ achoo hi rainbow dash fluttershy what happened to you oh i oh you poor thing you know there's only one cure for pony pox i know plenty of bedâ cold water those pony pox are clearing right up oh y'know all of a sudden i'm i'm starting to feel better i'll just get out of these robes andâ ow oh my wing oh ow it's hurt i guess i can't fly after allâ messed up wing huh stop horsing around fluttershy we've got a lot of training to do come on now what's going on well y'see uh well oh rainbow dash i just can't do it i can't fly what are you talking about just last week you went into that wicked nose dive to save that falling baby bird right before it hit the ground but that was different that was an emergency this whole tornado thing it's more like a performance and you know how i hate performing in front of others don't you remember flight camp i couldn't gallop hard or fly fast not with everypony looking at me it wasn't that bad you're right rainbow dash it wasn't bad it was horrible the other foals used to tease me a lot i just can't risk that sort of humiliation again suck it up fluttershy this is no time forâ i mean confidence or no confidence i'm gonna need every pegasus to break the record including you i need every ounce of wing power i can get oh i-i don't think so rainbow dash thanks anyway wait i'll do it you will i will you're game i'm game alright what exactly does this machine do this is an anemometer it measures your accelerative velocity and translates it into wing power thus gauging your cumulative h sub # sub o anti-gravitational potential any other questions yeah what exactly does this machine do it tells you how fast you're flying and how strong your wings are ohhhh okay i see is that you again thunderlane please we need to have a germ-free environment it wasn't me it was blossomforth don't worry twilight thunderlane's just cooking up an excuse to spend tornado day in bed why don't you get over here and be our first test flyer thunderlane we have #.# wing power wow that's fast yeah not bad not bad ##.# wing power now listen up if each of you can get your numbers up to at least ##.# wing power by the end of the week we'll no doubt set a new tornado speed record we'll be number one impressive fluttershy your turn fluttershy fluttershy fluttershy can hardly fly tell her no you tell her no you um great job fluttershy you measured uh uh # # isn't that like less than one ow fluttershy wait so some punks poked a little fun at you and you got stage fright big deal you aren't gonna go quit just because of that are you yes but i need you i'm sorry rainbow dash i just don't have the courage right now oh thank you but i'm afraid a couple of little acorns won't solve my big flying problem i tried but you should've seen those ponies laughing at me i know it's important to have confidence in myself yes yes i do remember the river was swelling and you were scared yes i did tell you to never give up and to believe in yourself you're right my friends i shouldn't give up i will get my confidence up and show everypony that i am a good flyer a great flyer that's wonderful flitter much better than yesterday this is crazy awesome we're gonna smash that record what did he say do i look like i speak squirrel what's that #.# #.# that has to be some kind of mistake i worked so hard fluttershy that's a huge improvement you did awesome fluttershy no i didn't i thought i'd gotten over my nerves but they still got the best of me there's no way i'll fly with ##.# wing power tomorrow so you won't fly with ##.# wing power every bit counts how would you feel if everypony else was flying with ##.# wing power and you were flying with #.# actually it was only #.# andâ ow well uh i'd feel um exactly humiliated i'm sorry rainbow dash i just can't do it it's okay rainbow dash you've still got plenty of wing power for your tornado you'll be able to lift tons of water up to cloudsdale if only there was a way to lift fluttershy out of the dumps are we ready to do this yeah look lazy thunderlane where is he he's been trying to get out of tornado duty the whole time with his fake coughing and all rumble where's your lazy brother he's got the feather flu he's down at ponyville hospital but he's not the only one let's see with those eight sick pegasi out with the feather flu oh no don't tell me we won't be able to break the windspeed record no phew you might not have enough wing power to create a tornado powerful enough to lift the water to cloudsdale well should we pack up no of course not forget the record cloudsdale still needs water okay everypony let's give it all we've got on the sound of the horn we take off you think they're gonna make it to eight hundred wing power i sure hope so one hundred and fifty wing power two hundred and fifty wing power five hundred wing power seven hundred and fifty wing power twilight fluttershy what are you doing here i figured if i couldn't help rainbow dash with the tornado the least i could do was offer moral support she could sure use it considering eight pegasi are sick with the feather flu oh no that's terrible news whoa yaaâ oof are you okay i'm fine oh you were so close to the eight hundred wing power minimum i'm sorry rainbow dash rbbbbâ we've got to try again but you've pushed your crew to their limit already if you break apart again somepony could get hurt you should quit it's not safe no one more time i've gotta know we gave it our all if i'm going down i'm going down flying c'mon ponies let's make this happen yeah okay here we go one hundred wing power two hundred five hundred stay in position flap those wings faster seven hundred seven hundred and fifty wing power they fell apart right after this oh i'm too nervous to look c'mon just a little harder i can see the water trying to funnel through seven ninety five we are so close fluttershy they need you up there i won't make a difference you can make a difference my measly #.# wing power is still too little it's sticking at seven ninety five i don't know if they've got any more in em do it for equestria do it for rainbow dash do it for yourself it's moving she's doing it seven ninety eight she surpassed her best wing power number no what was that i think it was fluttershy she did it she did it they all did it whoa girl take it easy whuh what did we do it yeah we did it you did it ah great job fluttershy that was awesome yeah we couldn't have done it without you nice job rainbow dash you may not have set a new record but you showed a lot of guts thanks but if you wanna talk guts then you've gotta give it to my number one flyer fluttershy let's hear it for fluttershy dear princess celestia can you believe featherweight got his cutie mark featherweight before us great cutie mark featherweight looking good i give up i've got it the answer to all our problems the foal free press how's the school paper gonna get us our cutie marks move your caboose uh-oh that's granny smith gotta run maybe there's something to this newspaper idea guess it's worth a shot apple bloom your newspaper idea was nothing but a big bust we tried everything from papier-mã chã© to making birds nests and nothing worked what's so funny what i meant was we should write for the paper we can get our cutie marks as journalists okay class see you tomorrow oh for those of you who want to join the newspaper staff stay here because we're meeting right now cutie marks in journalism such a good idea welcome everypony now as you know our editor-in-chief graduated last yearâ oh oh oh ohohohoh yes what's an editor-in-chief good question sweetie belle i like those reporters instincts the foal free press is a student-run paper i'm only involved as an adviser so the editor-in-chief is the pony in charge from choosing the stories to making sure it gets to press on time now as i said we have a new editor this year diamond tiara hm i'll leave you alone now to discuss everypony's assignments have fun alright listen up the foal free press is a joke huh nopony at this school takes it seriously well i the editor-in-chief in charge am going to deliver us to

baby birds the other day i bet our readers would eat up a sweet story like that granny smith has all sorts of great stories i reckon i'll do a piece on the history of ponyville i hope you've got something because everything so far is unusable baby birds born rarity's hot new hat ponyville the early years oh i don't know what you call this but it sure isn't news we just thought get something else on my desk by the end of the day and it better be juicy now what do you know what i had to do to get that story oh you don't even wanna know what i had to sit through oh get it off me snails eh you get it off me snips aah stop it you are making it worse nah oh great i'll get it aah get it off get it off take a few pictures of this then meet me during lunch girls i have our story snips and snails in bubblegum veils and that's when the biggest jokester in school really stuck his hoof in it â literally the foal free press is usually just boring news and stuff so funny our mothers always told us we'd end up in the papers someday yeah and look we finally got the gum out your column is a sensation i don't want you doing news anymore i want more columns like this columns about ponies and their private lives the things they do when they think they're alone you three are my new gossip columnists and i love the way you signed it gabby gums that was a stroke of genius we couldn't fit all

columns we'll earn our cutie marks for sure woo-hoo scootaloo do you have anything nope apple bloom sorry let's face it nothing very juicy happens at this school we're doomed ohh sweetie belle was she raised in a barn or something too rich can you please keep it down with all the laughter i'm trying toâ hey bleh i i was justâ are you snooping through my saddlebag how dare you oh but this gabby gums column is so funny you actually like the school paper it's so much juicier than anything in the boring old ponyville express could i borrow this to show my friends your friends would wanna read the foal free press oh they'd just love gabby gums who is she anyway i've never heard of her before is she a newâ we gave up too quickly girls forget trying to squeeze stories out of this school we need to expand we can find all kinds of great gossip out there in ponyville we'll need to tell featherweight to start working overtime sweetie belle you're a genius pound and pumpkin cake trip to the store ends in tears gabby gums comes through again the ponyville news stand wants to carry the foal free press ponies keep coming by and asking for it send em twenty copies and if they run out of those

privacy oh lighten up twilight there's nothing but harmless gossip yeah twilight i mean listen to this one mayor not naturally gray the mayor in a mane dyeing scandal who wouldn't wanna read that i just can't help feeling sorry for the ponies featured in her columns it's gotta be a little embarrassing are you kidding do you know how awesome it is to get your name in the paper rainbow why don't you join me in one of these delicious hooficures it's that good huh well maybe just one little hoof forget it i don't like ponies touching my hooves man i'd love it if gabby gums did a story on me she did one on me what aaaah exclusive local dragon tells all spike opens up about canterlot naps and his favorite jams it's our best column yet more like your worst column yet gabby gums didn't become the biggest thing in ponyville with namby-pamby stories like this yeah she's right this column is a little softer than our usual gossip were you guys feeling guilty about all the gossip too like maybe we could be hurting other ponies feelings yeah i didn't wanna say anything because everypony loves gabby gums so much but i was sorta hoping we could start writing more stories like this one me too if we're gonna get our cutie marks we've got to give the ponies what they want awww applejack asleep on the job can y'all believe this and this one big mcintosh â what's he hiding who the hay does this gabby gums think she is listen to this one twilight sparkle i was a canterlot snob a well-placed scaly source close to the prissy pony says twilight sparkle thinks ponyville is nothing but muddy roads and low-class rubes spike how could you say such a thing well i didn't gabby gums made that up i never said anything like that everypony please she's just a harmless schoolpony engaged in a little harmless gossip you're really making too big a deal out of this but it's all lies gabby gums prints whatever she wants she doesn't care whose reputation she destroys fluttershy has tail extensions pinkie pie is an out-of-control party animal what it's true i do have a problem oh look according to this one the cakes are breaking up we are well my life is officially over gabby gums has made it to cloudsdale rainbow dash speed demon or super softie i grabbed as many copies as i could but it was too late i'm a laughing stock see rarity your so-called harmless gossip can be very hurtful her the drama-queen diaries she's reprinted my diary how could gabby gums possibly get access to my private diary we've got to put a stop to this once and for all sweetie belle's on the newspaper staff maybe she knows who gabby gums is my sister would never associate with anyone as beastly as gabby gums i resent you even suggesting such a thing twilight why she's the most innocent most lovelyâ â most evil pony in equestria how could my own sister steal my private diary how could my own sister be gabby gums et tu gabby gums you know how'd you find out the gilded pages of your betrayal oh yeah how could you do this to me you stole my secret diary and published it for all the world to read gossip can be a very hurtful thing it is an invasion of privacy just like when i snooped through your saddlebag you didn't like that much did you no what is important is that you understand how your column makes the ponies that you're writing about feel i do understand and we've all been feeling guilty but we just want our cutie marks so badly do you really think that writing nasty things and making everypony feel horrible is your destiny well when you put it that way no i won't let you quit but the gossip we've been printing is hurting everypony's feelings feelings i don't care about feelings gabby gums is my bread and butter and i'm not gonna let you goody-two-horseshoes take that away from me we're sorry diamond tiara but we've made our decision yeah you can't force us to keep gossiping when you see these you may not want to quit after all i told featherweight to document everything and that's exactly what he did gimme those sorry girls property of the foal free press and if gabby gums really does go into retirement i'll need something to fill that empty column space now get out there and bring me more gabby gums we'll find a way out of this girls maybe rainbow dash will have a story for us she's always good for some gossip rainbow dash hey rainbow dash well if it isn't gabby gums you heard too huh are you kidding everypony in town knows it's you three don't suppose you'd let us write a column on you huh oh hi angel is fluttershy home hey what gives a-ha twilight thought you might

mmmm-marvelous whoa i know i think some congratulations are in order for a job well done um you better hold off on giving yourself an award just yet pinkie look look at what huh what is it what happened it's the marzipan mascarpone meringue madness it's been mutilated now we just need to find out who done it you mean who did it exactly who did-done-dood it well having read many mystery novels i know that the only way to discover the culprit is to investigate exactly and as chief detective that's exactly what i'm gonna do uh you're investigatin yes and twilight shall be my lowly assistant who asks silly questions with obvious answers fine pinkie should we start looking for clues perfect silly question my dear twilight because the obvious answer is yes no cause i know who did it pinkie how could you possibly know how could i possibly not know clearly this dastardly deed was done by the baker who knew their dessert could not measure up to the mastery of the marzipan mascarpone meringue madness i guess you feared your ã©clairs lacked flair gustave thus destroying the cake and the cakes chance of winning the national dessert competition but it makes no sense what do you mean lowly assistant well first if you were tied to the train tracks how are you now here huh guess that isn't a totally silly question and second the cake hasn't been sliced it's been bitten just look at the teeth marks hm you're right my fine fellow gustave le grand is clearly in the clear which means the mmmm was destroyed by another baker a baker who's donuts are do-nots that's right it was joe or as he's known the spy world mane con mane crushing the cakes chances to win pinkie there is no laser beam security system and joe is not sleek stealthy con mane he's big gruff and messy hey although you would look rather dapper in a tuxedo huh you may be right lowly assistant may be now that i'm taking a closer look at these desserts i see that one simply cannot look me in the eye pinkie that moose is a mousse yes and the mule behind the moose panicked when she saw the mastery of the mmmm so you're saying that the culprit is mulia mild putting an end to the cakes dreams of taking first prize huh i hope you're proud of yourself mulia pinkie stop this is ridiculous look at her i guess you're right thank you but i was so sure that it was one of the other bitter bakers that destroyed the mmmm that way their delicious dessert would reign supreme i mean just look at joe's donutopia it's a spectacular city of donutty delight topped temptingly in sprinklicious sprinkles and gustave's ã©clairs look incredibly edible with glistening glaziness but then there's mulia mild's mousse moose why this mouth-wateringly marvelous mousse moose tempts the taste buds with its silky smooth yummy-nummy chocolateyness so why did this criminal devour the marzipan mascarpone meringue madness while leaving this trio of tasty treats untouched now i have no idea who do-doned it this mystery gets more mysterious every minute well you have to stop the wild accusations and get to the truth everypony go back to your cars while we do a little investigating okay pinkie in order to really solve this mystery we're going to have to find clues now you were here at the scene of the crime all night huh you're not accusing me are you no but maybe you saw something that will help us i saw a silhouette in the moonlight good let's retrace your steps and then i chased the culprit down the train towards the caboose but when i got there he was gone hm a-ha our first clue i think i know who did it pinkie already yes but i need more evidence to confirm tell me what happened next i heard somepony else in the dessert car and chased them up to the engine but when i got there all i saw was the conductor shoveling coal the conductor huh but that doesn't make any sense what happened next pinkie well i went back to the dessert car yes the curtains mysteriously closed all on their own interesting anything else i heard hoofsteps a loud thud and then they were gone when i opened the curtains i saw that the portrait by the door was all crooked oh my what is that what next pinkie that's it i was here guarding the cake the rest of the night i mean i slept by the cake the rest of the night and when you woke up half the cake was gone exactly by jove i think i've got it call everypony back we have a cake culprit to catch why are we all here again i bet you're wondering why you're all here again she's good we have discovered the true culprit of this cake carnage but how well you see when committing a crime it's crucial that one never leaves behind clues especially an obvious clue like this a-ha a blue feather i knew it was you gustave le grand pinkie gustave doesn't have blue feathers no cause he's been dyeing them no pinkie remember how when you chased the suspect to the caboose they suddenly disappeared that's because they flew away but the thief did leave a little something behind didn't you rainbow dash i-i don't even like cake so rainbow dash did it case solved case not solved because when we went to the engine i saw the conductor's hat and inside the hat was this so it was you that pink hair came from your rainbow-colored mane i don't have pink in my mane pinkie so you're wearing a wig ow cut it out pinkie remember you chased a pony to the engine where you thought you saw the conductor shoveling coal but that wasn't the conductor at all it was fluttershy oh my you're goin down fluttershy pinkie but then another clue confounded my suspicions you were guarding the cake when the curtains mysteriously closed but that's no mystery that's magic but when the thief tried to make their great escape they left a little addition to the portrait has anypony else noticed that rarity is wearing her hair rather differently today what is it a crime to change one's style now and again why i think it's a crime not to really fine i'm guilty i wear false eyelashes oh and i took a bite of the cake so did i aw nuts so did i you just made it sound so delectable so tasty and boy was it i only meant to take a little lady-like bite and it was so good yeah i just dove right in but i'm really really sorry terribly sorry sorry pinkie that's okay at least this mystery is finally solved but it isn't we figured out who ate the marzipan mascarpone meringue madness but we still don't know who devoured the other bakers goods you're right twilight you know what we have to do well yes i do do you look for clues uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh well pinkie did you find the devourer of the desserts i most certainly did it was none other than the bakers first of all gustave has mousse in his moustache and joe has ã©clair in his hair and mulia has sprinkles in her wrinkles what do you say bakers oh i am so sorry mulia but pinkie made your mousse moose sound trã s magnifique and pinkie's description of your ã©clairs really did make em sound scrumptious and the way she spoke of your donutopia ohh was too delectable to resist well everypony we finally have the mystery solved yes but now we don't have any desserts to enter into ze contest i think we can fix that come on dear princess celestia how's that for a lesson princess celestia care for a bite i don't mind if i do mmmmm ahh it is gorgeous out just gorgeous twi light i have lemme just dear twilight

all thinking cadance is the absolute worst bride-to-be ever who me spike that goes on the cake twilight whatever are you talking about cadance is an absolute gem rarity she was so demanding well of course she is why shouldn't she expect the very best on her wedding day applejack did you know that after she told you how much she just love-love-loved your hors d'eouvres she threw them in the trash aw she was probably just trying to spare my feelin's no she was just being fake and totally insincere she did raise her voice at one of my birds during rehearsal see rude but he was singing really off-key pinkie pie you had to have noticed how cadance treatedâ never mind rainbow dash you're with me right sorry twi been too busy prepping for my sonic rainboom to pay much attention to the bride's bad attitude the princess is about to get married i'm sure any negative behavior she might be displaying is simply the result of nerves and i'm sure it's the result of being an awful pony who doesn't deserve to even know shining armor let alone marry him think maybe you're bein just a tiny bit possessive of your brother uh-huh i am not being possessive and i am not taking it out on cadance you're all just too caught up in your wedding planning to notice that maybe there shouldn't even be a wedding twily your big brother's looking pretty good don't you think huh everything okay we need to talk

because you're evil evil and if i don't stop you you're gonna ruin my brother's life you want to know why my eyes went all nuh because ever since i started having to perform my protection spell i've been getting terrible migraines cadance hasn't been casting spells on me she's been using her magic to heal me and she decided to replace her bridesmaids because she found out the only reason they wanted to be in the wedding was so that they could meet canterlot royalty and if she hasn't been on her best behavior with your friends it's because with me being so busy she's had to make all the decisions about the wedding i was just trying toâ she's been completely stressed out because it's really important to her that our big day be perfect something that obviously wasn't important to you now if you'll excuse me i have to go and comfort my bride and you can forget about being my best mare in fact if i were you i wouldn't show up to the wedding at all c'mon y'all let's go check on the

bad student i'm tardy you are a wonderful student twilight i don't have to get a letter every week to know that really wait you can't punish her it wasn't her fault i'm listening please your highness we all saw that twilight was upset but we thought that the thing she was worrying about wasn't worth worrying about so when she ran off all worked up not a single one of us tried to stop her as twilight's good friends we should have taken her feelings seriously and been there for her please don't take her away from us just because we were too insensitive to help her looks like you all learned a pretty valuable lesson today mm-hmm very well i'll forget twilight's punishment on one condition from this day forth i would like you all to report to me your findings on the magic of friendship when and only when you happen to discover them princess celestia wait how did you know i was in trouble your friend spike made me aware that you were letting your fears get the best of you i commend him for taking your feelings seriously now if you will all excuse me i must return to canterlot i'm expecting some mail y'all heard the princess spike take a letter dear princess celestia we learned that you should take your friends worries seriously even if you don't think that she has anything to worry about and that you shouldn't let your worries turn a small problem into an enormously huge entire-town-in-total-chaos princess-has-to-come-and-save-the-day problem signed your loyal subjects p.s obviously spike did not have to learn a lesson because he is the best most awesome friend a

applejack as my big sister what what what a sister is someone who loves and takes care of another sister applejack's a real sister h-hold on sweetie belle don't get ahead of yourself here besides

bein sisters is a give and take you've been doin a whole lotta takin but you haven't been doin a whole lotta givin but of course i give i give lessons reasonable demands but ya never give in bein sisters is like apple pie you can have amazin apples and you can have a wonderfully crispy crust but only together you can have a perfect apple pie but apart all we are is just a pile of mush and some

three talents i've never seen anything like it i was just reading something about unusual equine illnesses what was it perplexing pony plagues perhaps yes spike you're amazing yes well i do have some talents hay fever the trots cutie pox cutie pox cutie pox this puzzling pony plague afflicted a population of ponies back in the paleopony period heh say that ten times fast random cutie marks appeared all over the ponies bodies causing them to perform all the talents that came with them just like me yes but what's the cure what's the cure it says here there's no known cure no known cure the cause of the breakout was never discovered and the cutie pox disappears as mysteriously as they arrived oh no sacrebleu plus de marques de cutie what's this i speak french my sister's speakin in fancy she needs help i know she needs help we can't just wait for this to go away we gotta find somepony to mix up a cure and fast tout de suite now not some pony some zebra zecora hurry hurry dã©pãªchez-vous hurry she's cursed hexed enchanted no she's not she just has some weird mysterious disease with no known cure called cutie pox cutie pox she's got the cutie pox i thought i had removed their fear the last time that i visited here but doors are barred and shutters shut guess i should've stayed inside my hut zecora apple bloom has cutie pox we were just on our way to see if you had a cure but magically you're here was your zebra sense a-tinglin my zebra sense did not bring me round it was a special flower that i needed found i thought i picked enough to fix all the potions i had to mix but after my visit from apple bloom some had mysteriously left my room apple bloom what do you say did this flower just walk away i um a cutie pox cure i have forsooth for healing power is in the seeds of truth well well then give em to her quick these seeds must be planted in the ground with the truth they'll grow and the cure is found come again the seeds of truth do hold the cure but one must speak words true and pure well then let's get to it alright they're planted now somepony tell the truth whoa whoa whoa whoa somepony anypony yesterday i told mrs cake that i ate two corn cakes but i really ate three okay six i ate six corn cakes make it stop oh make it stop wah i can't stand it any more it's me i admit it i didn't earn my cutie mark they're all fake i figured the heart's desire would help me get what i wanted most so when zecora left her hut i mixed up a special potion and put the rest of the heart's desire in it ahh apple bloom are you okay i'm great and i've never been happier to be a blank flank but i'm awful sorry i lied specially to you gals i was so desperate for my cutie mark i just got carried away and i'm really sorry i snuck those flowers from you zecora why i wouldn't blame you if you never wanted me to come by again now apple bloom do not be silly you are always welcome my little filly with each mistake you learn something new growing up into a better you apple bloom would you mind writing to princess celestia and telling her what you've learned i'd be happy to twilight spike ready dear princess celestia i sure am proud of you sis seems like you finally learned the importance of patience yup all good things come to those who wait well i've waited long enough actually that was way too long what so what are we gonna do today to earn our cutie marks well i was thinking for a pony who's never mixed up a potion before you sure stirred up something fierce yeah so what if your talent is potion making oh my gosh totally let's go talk to zecora now yeah woo-hoo ha-ha whoo-hoo yeah whoa who oh it's you owlowiscious c'mon try and keep up winona i mean winona's head um is this weird or is it just me angel gummy okay this is officially beyond weird now and right on down to freaky town yaaaaah whaa phew let's get this thing started sincerest apologies rainbow if our pets were bothering you say you're sorry opal she's sorry what are you all doing out here why we always round up our critters for a regular ol pony pet playdate in this park uh you do same time every week i thought you knew you didn't know she didn't know well we had initially planned on inviting rainbow of course exceptâ we were totally gonna invite you rainbow then twilight remembered that you don't even have a pet and rarity remembered that you really like to take naps in the afternoon so applejack figured you wouldn't be missing out on anything anyway and fluttershy and i nodded our heads in agreement like this oh please don't be mad at us oh i'm not mad you all are right not much point of a pony pet playdate for me if i'm a pony without a pet right eeexactly so if'n you'll excuse us hey now wait a minute just because i don't have a pet now doesn't mean i never want a pet ohh y y oh really you really want a pet really cause i've got so many wonderful choices at my house oh and i know you'll just love them and they'll love you oh and you'll be best friends forever and ever oh so you all think you've got what it takes to be my pet do ya well we'll just see about that if any of you don't think you can handle it bow out now before you humiliate yourself in front of your peers this competition isn't for the weak you'd better be prepared to step up your game you call that flapping that's better there's only room on team dash for one of you and my future pet needs to be able to take it to the extreme any questions i got one does she understand what a pet really needs yeah like care and attention love and affectionâ ugh and breath mints now you just pay attention and try your best andâ seriously fluttershy the turtle what did you bring that thing here for technically he's a tortoise and he's always dreamed of being somepony's pet he just wants a chance to compete he won't get in the way you won't even know he's here no oh just let him try ugh but there's no way he can possibly keep up look at him it won't hurt to let him try butâ just let him try grrgh ugh fine but don't say i didn't warn you this isn't a game you know alright now these games will determine which one of you has the most important qualities i'm looking for in a pet speed agility guts style coolness awesomeness and radicalness aren't those all the same thing you would think that twilight and that's why you would never qualify to be my pet speed on your marks get set sorta speedy not speedy pretty speedy could be more speedy yeah that's speed tsk-tsk that's just sad agility sorta agile not agile pretty agile could be more agile wanna know the opposite of agility that yeah baby now that's what i call agility don't leave me hangin i'm gonna have to shave a point off your score for that okay which of you has the guts to try and get opal's favorite toy away from her now that takes guts style any pet of mine's gotta look good cause you gotta make me look good coolness sorta cool not cool pretty cool could be cooler not what i had in mind i can't hear you eugh now that's a cool sound uh you did that already that's pretty much all you can do huh whoa that was truly awesome but i'm afraid this is the radicalness competition so i'm gonna have to take some points off listen turtle tortoise whatever you've had your fun but i think you and i both know who made the cut and who didn't you didn't i mean a for effort and everything you gave it your best shot maybe i've got a gold star sticker around here somewhere you can have but seriously go home you're starting to creep me out so anyway you're all outstanding competitors but there can only be one of you who's number one so the final tie-breaking contest is going to be pause for dramatic effect a race against me through ghastly gorge dun dun dun gesundheit actually ghastly gorge isn't scary it's fun heh i've flown through it a million times myself so obviously i'll be at the front of the pack but whichever of you make it across the finish line with me will have proven you can keep up with me and will have earned the honor and glory of getting to be my pet ready setgo woo-hoo haha try to keep up can't catch me ha-ha c'mon slowpokes you wanna win don't ya oh i forgot to tell you watch out for the quarray eels they don't like it when you get too close to their nests like this whoa easy peasy one-two-threesy right guys avalanche hey whoaaaa c'mon no wait come back don't leave me i'm the one who's supposed to win i don't wanna end up stuck here forever oh no nonono th-this can't be happening forever is way too long to be trapped in ghastly gorge i mean it's like forever somepony anypony help me wahoo my prayers have been answered oh thankyouthankyouthaâ you oh no now i'm not only going to be stuck here forever i'm gonna be stuck here forever with the most annoying turtle in the world gyh i'm doomed doomed i tell you hm something's not right here where's rainbow dash great galloping galoshes there's been an avalanche in there rainbow wait look it's the turtle tortoise oh whatever and he's carrying something on his back ahh it's rainbow dash it's her it's rainbow maybe we'd better go meet him halfway huh way to go little guy oh thank goodness you're not hurt rainbow just my pride i certainly hope all of this dreadful dust was worth it it sure was if'n it means rainbow gets to have her own little critter just like the rest of us from now on uh thanks what you did i owe you one rainbow your new pet is over here waiting for you oh right yeah that what's the matter you got your perfect pet right the best of the best like you wanted remember it can fly and it's not a squirrel should we sing about it again a falcon sure looks good on ya rainbow easy fella nothing to be afraid of the falcon sure does looks cool he's absolutely everything i wanted in a pet yay but i said whoever crosses the finish line with me gets to be my pet you did you did say that she did say that that was the rule and the only racer who crossed the finish line with me was the one who stopped to save me when i needed help the tortoise but what about theâ wouldja look at that he even smiles slow spike take a letter dear princess celestia today i learned what the most important quality really is a certain kind of spirit a stick-to-it-ive-ness a never give up can-do attitude that's the mark of a real winner and this tortoise has it tenacity gesundheit you just can't stop that little guy he's like a like a tank but rainbow you didn't want a pet that couldn't fly because it would keep you grounded and hold you back remember hmm heh c'mon tank we're gonna be late for our very first pony pet playdate attention everypony attention the official rainbow dash fan club will come to order let's get right down to our first order of business i motion that rainbow dash be declared the most awesome pony in ponyville i second the motion and might i add that if you looked up the word awesome in the dictionary there would be a picture of rainbow dash i object i think the word awesome is played out rainbow dash deserves better i motion that we declare her the most stupendous pony stupendous is that the best you've got i motion that we declare her wonderiffic astonishing breathtaking astounding bedazzling what about super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing all in favor of declaring rainbow dash the most super-ultra-extra-uh-whatever you said pony in all of ponyville say aye aye what a beautiful day there's nothing like a dip in the clouds to make a pegasus feel super relaxed help help help help looks like my sky swim will have to wait i'm rainbow dash and i'm here to rescue you wow what's with this crowd uh thanks everypony it was really no big deal to me it was you're my hero rainbow dash that rainbow dash sure is something something special oh no there's something wrong with the baby she's not cheering for everypony's favorite hero rainbow dash there just aren't enough words in the dictionary to describe rainbow dash's awesomeness i can think of a few new words and i bet modest is not one of them no but she is kinda awesome never fear your friendly neighborhood rainbow dash is here we'd be lost without you you're our hero rainbow dash rainbow dash rainbow dash i can't hear you rainbow dash rainbow dash rainbow dash rainbow dash rainbow dash rainbow dash rainbow dash call me silly but i think this whole hero thing might be going to rainbow dash's head you may be right silly and then i zoomed into the well i knew it would be dark and dangerous but i didn't let that stop me danger's my middle name rainbow danger dash thinking back on it i acted pretty awesomely heroic that day that day awesomely heroic that day and awesomely arrogant ever since mm-hm hey applejack how'd you like to be immortalized as my friend immorta-what are you taking notes yup i've been hoof-picked by rainbow dash herself to write her autobiography umm autobiographies are supposed to be written by the pony they are about maybe for your normal run-of-the-mill ponies but i'm far too busy saving lives to stop and write that's why i hired spike as my ghost writer spike's a ghost anyway spike here writes down everything i say don't you spike don't you spike got it this way i can stay focused on performing those acts of bravery that nopony else has the guts to perform yep it takes guts but it also takes brains and sometimes a big lunch and a nap being a hero is surely not for everypony but i'm up to the challenge there you go someday i wanna be just like you aim high kid but don't aim for the impossible help help uh don't you think you should go and help yeah yeah i've got a good ten seconds to spare just a couple more the tension is unbearable will rainbow dash make it on time holy turnips that pony came outta nowhere i've never seen such bravery in all my life that's right ponyville has a new hero a mysterious mare that has done well by our fair city today i dub this new masked hero the mysterious mare do well mare do well huh well that mare would do well to stay outta my way ponyville's only got room for one hero and that hero is me never fear your friendly neighborhood rainbowâ excuse me uh do you think you could skip your catchphrase and just hurry up and save us ugh fine picky picky whoaaaa aah oh thank you mare do weâ e i can't believe it mare do well is stronger than me well a hero is more than just muscle and she's gonna learn that the hard way huh huh never fear your friendly neighborâ whoa never fearâ uh i'm coming hold on whoa look look out for theâ watch out for fallingâ on your left agh your other left here ya go safe and sound well mare do well or should i call you mare do slow you're gonna have to pick up the pace if you wanna compete with me cause i move like lightning actually she saved all of us we owe her our lives okay she's strong fast and somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time i've gotta step up my game if the dam breaks the whole town will be flooded looks like ponyville needs a hero easy peasy my game is officially back on if only somepony were here to pat me on the back eh guess i'll have do it myselfâ help you i suppose you want me to thankâ you gotta be kidding me lemme get this straight she's strong she's agile and she's magic ughhh how do i compete with that wait a minute i do have a leg up on her and that leg is wings hah take that mare do well oh for the love of pete gotta hand it to the girl that mare do well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats i must say i was impressed by that spell she used to fix the dam seems like something like that would take quite a bit of study she really cares about everypony's safety have you seen her costume it is to die for if you ask me she's a hero of fashion and she's modest and humble she lets her actions speak for themselves gotta admire that i don't have to admire that i don't think she's all that great she's great i didn't say that sounds like somepony's jealous who me rainbow dash is jealous don't write that spike correction rainbow dash is very jealous fine laugh all you want but i'll be the one laughing when i prove to you all that i'm just as goodâ no that i'm a better hero than mare do well huh no sign of trouble here darn it buses and baby carriages are always careening down this hill where is an out-of-control vehicle when you need one rrgh there are absolutely no freak natural disasters going on anywhere how am i supposed to prove myself when everything's so normal and safe hold it right there granny smith you don't have to pretend with me i can see that you're in way over your head here eh what's that you're putting on a brave face i get it but you don't have to anymore i'll help you cross the street actually i can cross the street just fine don't worry you're in extremely capable hooves back off here we are safe and sound a good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition don't you think i didn't wanna cross the street in the first place somepony's in trouble you'd better let me handle this ma'am for your own safety i must ask you to stand back oh brother ta-da uh thanks how would you describe what i just did would you say i was amazing aren't you milking this a bit please just answer the question was i or was i not amazing oh you're amazing alright an amazinglyâ oh look another great feat of heroism i have just saved that grass from what from weeds weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn lame whatever aww who am i kidding all anypony talks about is mare do well this and mare do well that what about me how could everypony forget about me so easily i mean have i changed same sleek body same flowing mane same spectacular hooves nope i'm still awesome they're wrong but then why am i all alone i hate being all alone hey rainbow dash i knew it no need to apologize squirt anypony could make that mistake mistake what mistake wait a minute why are you here to invite you to join us we're heading off to the thank

we all played mare do well at different times i stopped the carriage bus with these babies bucky mcgillicuddy and kicks mcgee i saved the construction workers with my pinkie sense sorry it's alright and i used my magic to fix the dam ooh ooh and i did the flyby afterwards i made the costumes fabulous if i do say so myself i don't understand why don't you want me to be a hero of course we want you to be a hero but a real hero doesn't brag uh i guess i did start to brag a little a little okay a lot celebrating your accomplishments is natural but rubbin them in everypony's face is not yeah the only thing that should be rubbed in anypony's face is chocolate cake i think we're getting off topic here what we're trying to say is it's great to be really good at something but it's important to act with grace and humility ohhhh that makes loads more sense yeah you're right and i guess i should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me like mare do well sounds like you've got a letter to write to princess celestia already got it covered as your ghost writer i've already penned a letter to the princess that's nice of you spike but i really wanna write this letter myself aww come on i wrote the whole thing already okay let's hear it dear princess cel look out it's a real ghost here i get to stay here twilight sparkle said you were coming to canterlot for a visit and

into the amount of time i have to finish twilight's outfit pro fancy pants is the most important pony in canterlot his stamp of approval could mean big things for me here con twilight's party might

hate to let them down and i won't opal i am going to the wonderbolts derby as a guest of fancy pants pardon me scuse me scuse me rarity jolly good to see you so glad you could make it everypony this

looks like we'll be spending a few more days here opalescence turns out bumping into fancy pants like that was the best thing that's ever happened to me of course finishing twilight's dress in time

get going i must get back to ponyville with enough time to finish twilight's ensemble for me dearest rarity your presence is requested at the canterlot garden party tomorrow afternoon yours jet set and upper crust my dear twilight i am afraid i won't be able to make it to your birthday party tomorrow because because poor opal is quite ill and she is in no condition to make the long journey back to ponyville i do hope you understand your friend rarity i suppose this means you don't need me to bring down your bags no but i will need some help unpacking them oomph what do you think too much you're right too little ah garden party here i come surprise swoosh and right before she hit the ground shoom sheâ hi again what are youâ how did youâ why are youâ listen to her she's so excited to

you twilight let me explain iâ i hadn't realized you were such a savvy businesspony you must understand iâ all of those ponies look so posh and with the grand galloping gala coming up i bet you could totally get some of them to buy your dresses very smart woo wwwhy yes i-i didn't want you to think i was being rude so that's exactly the reason i didn't tell you the one and only reason oh well you didn't have to do that you should totally go over there and mingle twilight you really are the best friend a pony could ever ask for i don't know why i ever thought you wouldn't understand understand what nothing see you girls later hey wait up we're your friends i'm sure they won't mind if we check out the party too c'mon you guys let's show them how to party ponyville style oh no mmm how come y'all aren't doing any gardening this is a garden party isn't it can you believe what that pony is wearing it's just so plain yeah excuse me might i ask where you got your ensemble why yes yes you may

side of the room in a moment my dear this lovely filly from ponyville was just about to tell me who made her charming dress that dress oh come now who cares it's just a plain oldâ oh don't be so modest this dress you made is beautiful we all think so you know these ponies yes yes i do know them they may not be as sophisticated as some of you canterlot ponies but they are my best friends and they are without a doubt the most important ponies i know important ponies these ruffians don't make me laugh i for one find them charmingly rustic and i think the dress you made for your friend is lovely i dare say every mare in canterlot will be wanting one oh i'd like to place my order right now i think you should get two er yes now then how about you introduce me to your friends with pleasure dear princess celestia now that i would like to hear i learned that no matter where you go in life you should never forget that you are the product of your home and your friends and that is something always to be proud of no matter what hm a very valuable lesson to have learned it certainly is but might i ask that we hurry things up a bit oh no        
